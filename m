I would be interested in the reasons why this is bad. We thought is solved 
the problem, and our driver developers are Ok using it, and it is catching 
more problems at compile time than we use to (which is the main reason I 
thought to remove all the volatile casting.

The thing to understand about the Blackfin architecture - is not all system 
register, or peripheral registers are 32 bits. Some are 16 bits, and some 
are 32. The Hardware will error if you access a 32 bit instruction, with a 
16 bit access, or a 16 bit access on a 32 bit instruction.

This is why we added:
bfin_write16();  bfin_read16(); bfin_write32();  bfin_read32();

We can't use a common function, like:

bfin_sica_read(int reg)

or use the read16/read32 directly - it would be to hard for the driver 
developers to keep the manual with them all the time to find out if a 
register was 16 or 32 bits. It would move what we have today (compiler 
errors), to run time errors if someone used the wrong function.

We could use this approach, filling it up with 16 bit padding all over the 
place (which is easy to do), but it is also difficult for the same reason. 
(Although I really like this, and can see lots of value from it - I am not 
sure we can use it).

You are still using writel(reg, value) and readl(reg) - which is hard to 
do, without a hardware reference beside you all the time - to determine 
which time you should use a readl or reads.

Unless I am completely missing something (which might be true).

Although I think the code is smaller, and nicer - it involves more run time 
complexity, and will consume more processor cycles - the old example:

static void bf561_internal_mask_irq(unsigned int irq)
{
         unsigned long irq_mask;
         if ((irq - (IRQ_CORETMR + 1)) < 32) {
                 irq_mask = (1 << (irq - (IRQ_CORETMR + 1)));
                 bfin_write_SICA_IMASK0(bfin_read_SICA_IMASK0() & ~irq_mask);
         } else {
                 irq_mask = (1 << (irq - (IRQ_CORETMR + 1) - 32));
                 bfin_write_SICA_IMASK1(bfin_read_SICA_IMASK1() & ~irq_mask);
         }
}

resolves all addresses at compile time, not run time. So, wouldn't your 
example slow things down?
