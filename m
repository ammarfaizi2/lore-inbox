I suspect that if we're going to do this again, having a microphone at
each table is what we'd have to do, assuming that we can keep the
numbers of people at the workshop down to 60-70 (which will be a *lot*
harder next time, since everyone and his brother will want to show up,
and will therefore pester, whine, and otherwise beg the workshop
organizers to be included onto the invite list).

If we have a lot more people, we'll probably have to go to the two
microphones in the aisle approach.  But at that point a large part of
the workshop will be destroyed; so hopefully we'll just be able to
keep the numbers of people in the workshop to manageable number.
