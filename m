Well that's pretty typical.

What about those who cannot comment on the code, for example people who
have since died or dropped off the face of the Earth? Out of curiousity,
if anyone knows what view is held in that situation, I'd love to know.

This is of course purely academic. The day someone actually convinces
enough kernel developers to relicense under such terms is the day hell
freezes over and Darl personally calls each developer to apologise for
being an ass for the last few years.

Cheers,

Jon.
