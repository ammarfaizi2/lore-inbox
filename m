Subject: State of Posix compliance in v2.2/v2.4 kernel?

Hello.

Sorry if this is a FAQ, but I've searched the archives for this list
(http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/) and only come with references
from 1996!

What is the state of Posix-compliant services (threads, semaphores, timers,
etc.) in the current (v2.2/v2.4) Linux kernels?

Thank you.
