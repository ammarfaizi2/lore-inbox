	I don't understand why making proprietary software better and cheaper than 
it would otherwise be is a bad thing.

	It will be better because it will have a stronger base to build on. It will 
be cheaper both because it will be easier to construct and because it will 
have to compete with free software that is more similar to it.

	And, believe it or not, free software benefits as much from competition as 
proprietary software does.
