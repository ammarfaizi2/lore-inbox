Well for a price you could back up around the world, and have unlimited
amounts of storage per license and have unlimited (loads will limit the
unlimited) clients and have interoporability today.  But it is not free
now, but stood a strong chance of happening in 6mo for the basics.  The
serious core costly features would take longer to recover.  May 18mo of
the next feature, and finally 36mo for the end game.

This is in flux now because ....
