MS once described the GPL as a 'cancer'.  One of the 'features' of 
cancer is that it grows fast and can't be stopped easily, so I suppose 
they were correct...

MS history shows that they did and does support various flavours of 
*nix.  So, it is not beneath them to release apps for Linux too one day 
and it would be a good thing if they do.  Competition is always good. It 
inpires people to do better.
