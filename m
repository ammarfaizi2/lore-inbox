You are shit out of luck, upgrade to 2.4 and deal with the lack of
free complete drivers for the onboard audio, network, and video or return
the boards. I am not even sure if 2.4 will work seeing as how I was
told(by Alan and Vojtech) that 2.5 is the only kernel that supports the IDE
chipset on the board.
