I think that some in the community fully realize this, but
nevertheless think it is worth it for them to build clones after their
own cost-benefit analysis.

That last line is probably the most important.

How is it even possible for someone to not leverage your ideas, after
you've done such a great job telling everyone exactly what they are?

That's the problem with disseminating ideas - you infect everyone who
hears you.  They can't undo that, nor is it possible for them to
develop their own ideas independently from then on.

(And they say the GPL is viral, sheesh :)

There are pros and cons.  Declining to copy good, well tested ideas is
also "cutting off your nose to spite your face".

But anyway, I think this L-K community has more or less settled on the
compromise we have, and the SCM folk are, in their own slow way,
trying to work out something that is different from BK yet just as good.

That BK->CVS gateway was a *smart* move.
