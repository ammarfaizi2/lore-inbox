Ehm, I think you are overlook a serious issue assuming that every touch
of non-GPLed software immediately implies use and abuse of GPLed
software. That is not what I am talking about! I talk about keeping
compatible interfaces.

But where do you draw the line between communication and abuse of
other's work? What is the point of deliberate merge of interfaces with
code if not throwing stones in ways of others? Going back to your
comparison, it is like distributing your thesis with a following
license:

Noone ever making reference to my work is allowed to use the following
words: <followed by a list of domain specific terms>. Invent your own
words, but those are mine!!!!!1

Sounds childish? Exactly like GPLing interfaces is.

Welcome at the dark side. "Only the Sith deal in absolutes".
