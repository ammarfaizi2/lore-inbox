Greetings Craig et al. (bcc'ed)

After many missed attempts to have this meeting, we finally succeeded in
the long awaited discussion.  I must admit being surprized and now 
impressed with Promise's ablity and willingness to accept my defined
terms of IP boundaries.  With these small steps towards understanding IP
limitations, the next few days will prove, success in Linux for
Promise Technologies is a small folder of documents away.  By coming the
table of OPEN Source, you have demonstrated all things are possible and
are leading the way by actions and not just words.

ASL and I offer this informative message to the greater linux community,
and the fine details shall be disclosed in short order or as needed.

Finally, the important issue is Promise has agreed to work with Linux.

Regards,

Andre Hedrick
CTO ASL, Inc.
Linux ATA Development
