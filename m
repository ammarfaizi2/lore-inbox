  Thats for pointing out the breakage in hotadd_enough_memory.  I think
the find_e820_area stuff is to make sure there box has the memory to
reserve the maps....but it doesn't look to do it right.  I can take a
pass at a re-write for this function. 
   

STAT hot-add memroy areas can be outside the e820.  The e820 just
exposes the end of memory the is present in the box even though there
maybe add area on the other size of that.

For example my memory is layed out as follows.

SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 0-80000000
SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 0-470000000
SRAT: Node 0 PXM 0 0-1070000000
SRAT: hot plug zone found 470000000 - 1070000000
SRAT: Node 1 PXM 1 1070000000-1160000000
SRAT: Node 1 PXM 1 1070000000-3200000000
SRAT: hot plug zone found 1160000000 - 3200000000

The e820 ends at 1160000000 but there is still a possible add zone on
the other side of that. 

The first hot plug zone is reserved by the e820 but no the 2nd.

To make sure the areas are outside of the e820 are reserved.  

Thanks,
