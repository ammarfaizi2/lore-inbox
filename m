And how is someone from a forien country going to see just how much or how
little you have rebelled against the DMCA?  We allowed the law to be passed
so now we should take the blame?

Like some have already said, we have politicians that promise one thing, and

much they stick to their promisses when comes election time in 2-4 years
that determines wheather they stay there...
