Horse, barn... but horse (patch) is under 24/7 surveillance by one or two
GPS-locator-equipped robots that the horse can't escape from (e-mail
discussion and/or BK changelog entry) so who cares whether it's in the
barn or not? We can find the horse and bring it back to the barn either
way.

Or, to drop the metaphor: We do not *need* a solution that works before
the patch gets applied. It could be desirable, but it's not *necessary*.
Once a BK patch is applied, the code itself is not set in stone; the patch
can be discussed on the list, modified, or reverted (i.e., rejected after
all) just like a patch that was posted to the mailing list and discussed
first.
