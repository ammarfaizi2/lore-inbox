Subject: [patch 0/2] ftape update

I tried to contact the ftape maintainer, and was told that he did not have the 
time to maintain it, and it was pretty much a dead project.

Further communications went unanswered.

Given the state of the website he pointed me to, I'd say this project is
definitely a canidate for "orphan" status.

I cleaned up the docs a bit, and included a reference to it's orphan status.
