Thanks, someone has obviously rebuilt the kernel on the machine I was
considering, possibly even me... :-(

In any case if devfs is stable enough to be in the stable kernel, can we
really say that something using it isn't (for that reason alone)? I any

Okay, I'll look at other solutions, AIX seems able to handle it.
