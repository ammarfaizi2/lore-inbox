Through the stimulating discussion we had under ``IP Acounting 
Idea for 2.5'', it appears that a separate Traffic Flow Measure-
ment and Accounting sub-system would be useful. See:
        <http://logi.cc/linux/CounterReset/>

If anybody is working on Real Time Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM)
please reply.

I would also like to know if there are any objections to providing
a RTFM interface in the kernel (as an optional module).

FYI:

Considerable work has already been done on RTFM in general and 
for other systems: 
        <http://www2.auckland.ac.nz/net//Internet/rtfm/>
        <http://www.caida.org/>

Relevant RFCs include: 2720 ... 2724

Thanks
