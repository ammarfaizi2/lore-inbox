Hi all,

   This is my first posting to this list, and I am not subscribed (so 
please cc me in on any replies to this thread -thanks), however I do follow 
the kernel traffic weekly mail.

   I have recently acquired a Rio Riot 20Gb HDD USB MP3 Player, and I have 
had no luck finding a device driver so far, but I am willing to help with 
testing and possibly a bit of development (I am more accustomed to writing 
in Borland/FreePascal than c however).  Does anyone know of a driver 
project, or shall I start one off?  Is this better done in user-space?

   I apologise in advance if I have taken this to an inappropriate forum, 
or broken any of the guidelines for this list, however I did read section 3 
of the FAQ first.

Thanks in advance,
