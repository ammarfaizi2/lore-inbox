Hi,

The network block device userland code is on sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nbd/

There isn't much documentation, but feel free to send questions in my
direction. I don't know the answers to your iscsi query though but I'd
be interested to know what the current state of development is as well,

Steve.
