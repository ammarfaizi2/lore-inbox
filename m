	But I don't want to coerce other people into providing me with my freedom.

	Yes, even without being coerced and pressured to do so by restrictive 
licenses.

	The point is not to persuade companies to adopt the practice. The point is 
to show that the practice is superior and let the companies that adopt it 
prosper and those who don't fail. The GPL weakens this position by providing 
proprietary software with an excuse.

	It is roughly comparable to the United States embargo on Cuba. We want Cuba 
to change, so we don't let them use any of our stuff. Force them to be free, 
or we won't touch 'em.

	It fails for the same reason. If you believe in freedom, set the example. 
Set people free. Defend fair use, first sale, and a very strict definition of
a derived work.

	That's real freedom, and the GPL works against it by attempting to coerce 
freedom by using legal tools that problably shouldn't exist.

	No. We're saying that we shouldn't try to rig the system. We should allow 
free software to win in a fair fight. Not by using vicious legal tools to 
coerce others to provide your freedom.

	Defending shrink wrap licensing agreements, arguing to weaken fair use and 
first sale doctrines, and arguing that if you include a header it's a derived 
work is a strange way to defend intellectual freedom.
