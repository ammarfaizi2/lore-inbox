Hello all.

I'm getting a kernel panic from my 2.4.22 kernel when compiled for
i486 (see attached .config).

"Kernel panic: Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires TSC feature!"

The CPU is a Cyrix Cx486DX2 100MHz part.  I tried booting with notsc
but I get the message:
"notsc: Kernel compiled with CONFIG_X86_TSC, cannot disable TSC."

The kernel will work fine when recompiled for i386.

Does a real 486 have a TSC, or is this a config bug?
