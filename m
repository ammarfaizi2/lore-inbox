Mosaic is/was derived from two sources - gopher for network communication 
(derived from network news and/or e-mail) and SGML combined with display only
word processor applications (postscript and pdf previewers).

sendmail was derived from a message routing protocol originally using UUCP, 
written to promote research in message routing, and flexibility to reduce the
re-implementation time required on earlier applications. (somewhere there is a
quote from Eric Allman along the lines of "...If I had known how popular it
would become I would have asked for a dime for each installation...")

Neither looked revolutionary at the time.
