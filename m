It's not my patch or my site.  I also wasn't the one who made previous
requests for it.  However, I have noticed that multiple requests for
inclusion were ignored without any reason, so I figured it was just lost
in the shadow of more important things till now.  It has already been
included in 2.6 for a long time, btw.
