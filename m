(Tried posting this before, but apparently it didn't get through.
Apologies if it did.)

Just out of curiosity - where do you get firmware updates for hard
drives? I know that most can be flashed with newer firmware, yet i never
saw an actual update available.

I have two IBM DTLA that sometimes make the "funny IBM noises",
occasionally accompanied by ide resets. They haven't hung the bus, yet,
but I'd like to be on the safe side.
