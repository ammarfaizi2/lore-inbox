Let me take a look...

It says SCO for now can't claim that Linux has being using protected Unix
code. If SCO goes on doing so, they might have to pay up to E250.000.- in
fines. The same goes for SCO Germany (due to a separate court decision in
Bremen).

This decision is in force until SCO shows evidence for their claims (as was
asked for by LinuxTag e.V.) [This I get from other stuff I've read about
the matter].

It goes on to describe SCO's woes, that MS gratefully supported SCO's
actions, and the suspicion that this is just in order to get bought up.
