It's absolutely right. You are going to get emails like this very soon

Quickly, send me an email or call me and you will get real com.miss.ion
emails with this 
subject line and big, big comm_ission pa.yments from all the bus_inesses
you pro_mote. 

To pro.ve it, for a limit_ed per_iod I will give.you 10 sign_ups (that will
p.a.y. to
 j.o.i.n. your bus.in.ess) and I will not ask you for a sin.gle cent/penny
to get you 
star-ted. Use these to gen_erate an in.stant in.com_e.

Then sitback & watch the_sign_ups join_you inst_antly in their droves and
without you 
having to do much_at all.

At the end of March you will get comm_ission state_ments showing that you
have
ear.ned tens_of thou_s_ands of doll_ars from your existing
bus..iness.oppo.rtun.it.ies. 

Miss. this and def_in.it.ely miss.out on the ea-sie.st and fas.test mo.ney
that you will 
ever ma.ke from your bu.sin_ess opp.or-tuni.ty
