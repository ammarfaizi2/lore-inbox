Absolutely. You cannot do a news site of LWN quality with 100
volunteers that all spend 2 hours a week getting informed.

Instead, you need a few people that are really well informed.
This costs money, because these people won't have time to do
other things that pay their bills.

I'm donating some money right now. If it doesn't save them for
a bit more time I'll just consider it overdue subscription fees
and a thank you...
