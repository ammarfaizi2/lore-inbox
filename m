Hi!

I have written a driver for a PCI card (produced by the company I work
for) and it's working well. Now I should write a documentation, but
I have never done such kind of low level tasks in a PC enviroment.
I know what design docs and other docs are needed for a normal
program (C, C++) but I have no idea how I could write a doc
for a driver.

Is there any template there? I bet you also had to write documentations
if you work for a company.

Can anybody give some advice? Of course I would like to write it
using Linux, so please don't mention M$ only sws! (bad news that
my boss would like to view it on M$ :(((( )

(ps. I don't like flowcharts...)

Thanks

Gabor
