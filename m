long-time user, first-time caller. :)

sorry I can't provide more information -- I've really tried to look 
around the web for more info but I am completely stumped.

I have a Thinkpad T20 and have been using a hand-built 2.4.5 kernel for 
some time.  Recently, ever since I got a USB scanner and camera, I've 
been experiencing spurious machine hangs.  I read on one of the lists 
that there was a bug in the USB core that sounded related so I tried to 
upgrade.

Everything works ok with the stock 2.4.17 kernel (except the addition of 
the pcmcia-cs pacakge version 3.1.31) I built except that "apm -s" and 
then resume causes the machine to hang.  On resume, even outside of X, 
the screen blanks or appears but doesn't respond to keyboard input.  No 
oops, no messages, no nothing.  The only choice I have at that point is 
a hard reset.

I just tried the 2.5.3 beta kernel and had the same problem.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help diagnose 
the problem and/or workaroound it.  I'll include my .config file in case 
that helps.

Thanks and keep up the great work.
-Matt
