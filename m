No, this is, to me, _the_ issue.  And something you keep ignoring.
And proving that you ignored the point of Linus's first post in
this thread.

We have docs describing how kernel developers should merge with Linus.
In your opinion, if those docs describe closed source software,
they should be treated differently than other docs.  Regardless of
relevance.

They _are_ relevant, everyone admits that.  Therefore treating them
differently only introduces additional barriers and violates the
Principle of Least Surprise.

You are, in effect, trying to disallow politically incorrect speech
from the kernel sources.
