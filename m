Well, it's my GPL-compatible licensed patch, so you have the full right to 
modify it and to also Sign Off By it (patch-scripts can be configured to 
Sign-Off every patch you forward to someone else) - and fixing the changelog 
is a good idea.

Also, there is 0 code lines from me in this specific patch, actually...
