Please ask these kinds of questions of the cdrecord mailing-list or the
cdrecord author Jörg Schilling, instead of on this list (this is a
kernel development list, as opposed to a linux-users list).  Also, you
sent duplicate copies of your message only hours apart.  Please don't
do this.  Yes, we did get your message, but nobody replied to it because
it was off-topic and indicated a complete lack of RTFM and STFW.  Please
go read the associated documentation before asking questions, and then
ask them on the appropriate forum (if you still have questions).

Here is a good document about asking good questions:
