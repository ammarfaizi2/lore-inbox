Sorry, I don't have much interest in keeping this up to date for ARM
platforms; there are too many ARM platforms around which would make
this a full time job.

I'm not certain that all the ARM platforms we appear to support in
2.6.x are actually working - again, it comes back to time, people and
testing.
