The contents of the BK, ie the metadata is Free software, licensed under the 
GPL. Therefore i don't understand .. Isn't this then a violation of the GPL ?

Isn't this something like M$ stating that you are the property of M$ because 
you are using one of their systems. Worser still ? Do you mean to say M$ owns 
all *.doc, *.xls  files etc as an example... If so, then that is really 
bad ..

sarcasm ? Even the linux kernel is free software ..
Isn't this is just like M$ marketing talk ?

It's a contradiction, considering the earlier two statements.

I agree to the fact that BK has made Kernel development faster, which has 
therefore helped.

I'm not a BK user. I download the tarballs, but the statements by Mr. Larry 
has shaken me a bit. 

As per the statements by Mr. Larry, what i understood is that the BK metadata 
belongs to Mr. Larry legally as per the US rules and regulations.
