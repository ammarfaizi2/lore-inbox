No, it's a Republic.  More specifically, a representative democracy, which
means that we're at the mercy of the people we've given license to
represent us.  They make all sorts of promises to get in office, and then
go do their own damn thing anyway.

Unfortunately, the people I vote for never make it in to office, but
that's fodder for an entirely off-topic debate (flamewar?) on American
Politics.  But, because I at least voted, I reserve the right to bitch
about what the people in office are doing. =)

I've written my representatives and voiced my opinions, but apparently
I'm of such a small minority that I think I'm being ignored.
