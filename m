Hi,
  System: Dual Athlon Tyan S2460 board with pair of Athlon MPs, IDE
  discs on onboard controller and Promise.  3c509 ether.  Radeon
  History: Previously stable.  Seen one other random hang at about t3.

Left the machine for 5 mins and came back to non-responsive keyboard
(not even capslock), didn't ping, and monitor was in power save.
Nothing incriminating in logs. Just X, a few konsoles, gnome-cd, mozilla
and bitchx running.

Config file included for the interesting.

It had survived over night and an hour of being left alone before.

Dave
