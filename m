Yep, I totally agree, its unacceptable, a few points:

"...with FIRST CLASS HONOURS  in Computer Science or a similar degree..."
then "...must be a UNIVERSITY graduate...".
The former cancels the latter.  Although, they might be making a point that
'internet degrees' from Spam mail don't count.

"...who is REALLY EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD at it...", as opposed to really crap at
it?  or maybe partially exceptional at it?

And the best one, "[our company]...is very sophisticated."  Yes, like the
sophisticated advertisement you came up with.

My five year old daughter actually has better grasp of grammar than this
ad...

Chris.
