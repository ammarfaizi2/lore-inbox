Actually, I tried to setup a mailing list (linux-future@nl.linux.org)
for discussions about future ideas for Linux, etc...

In practice most discussions just came back to linux-kernel or to
subsystem lists every once in a while. If you feel you want to
ramble about long-term ideas or random OS ideas you think might be
cool to have in Linux sometime in the future, feel free to use that
list I made (it's still around), but most serious discussion will
end up here sooner or later ...

regards,

Rik
