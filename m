Hi,

First i apologize i realize this mailing list isn't the best place to post
this question. That said i am trying to install Redhat 7.1 on a new machine.
The computer has an adaptec 2400A IDE RAID controller card on it. Out of the
box, redhat doesn't see the card so it can't find a drive to install on. The
card comes with drivers for redhat 6.0-7.0. SO basically i read that to mean
anything other then the 2.4 kernel.. I just want to know if anyone knows of
a driver for redhat 7.1?  Thanks in advance
