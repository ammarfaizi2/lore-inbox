Oh guys I did not think that this is so "technically impossible".
It's good for me to be informed what phylosofical differences you have
between SGI and Linux programming style.

If the merge will not happen in around a half year - I think SGI/XFS "will
lose market share". And Ext3 is gonna get more of the pie as that is
(maybe) possible to patch in the kernel.

I really hope, that there will be a nice technical solution to this issue
and there will be no political decisions over technical.

Thanks
