No, that is a good idea.  All these Mutt entries are silly.

Further, I bet mailers like Mozilla and Evolution would be very near the
top if all the versions were merged.

Also, as someone else I believe pointed out, there is a bug. F.e.,
"Ximian" should be "Ximian Evolution" -- it looks like anything after
the space is being ignored, which is no good.  I like Randy's idea of
ignoring up to the '/'.
