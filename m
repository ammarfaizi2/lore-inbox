Second post in my "Understanding the Principles of Argumentation" series.

You have just provided us with a fine example of a common logical falacy 
called "bifurcation":

   "Also referred to as the "black and white" fallacy.  Bifurcation is
   the presentation of a situation or condition with only two
   alternatives, whereas in fact other alternatives exist or can exist."
