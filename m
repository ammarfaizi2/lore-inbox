Alan,

Okay, but they had a lawyer draft a position.
Now given that RMS, FSF, et al. are out of the picture, and left to the
domain of the copyright holders, and you have a position of stenght.
Are you going to enforce the copyright on every file you have your name
on, regardless?

If this is the case, then the rest of us sadly have to pick sides.
