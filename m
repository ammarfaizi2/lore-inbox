Richard,

By this point, BitKeeper users will continue to be BitKeeper users and 
BitKeeper haters will continue to be BitKeeper haters.  No one's mind is 
changing about BK these days -- either they like it or they don't.  The 
debate has reached the level of emacs vs. vi, pro/anti-abortion, gun 
control, <insert favorite political issue here>.

No one's mind is being changed, there's just a lot of energy wasted on 
pointless ranting.

Thus, you should have seen even before hitting 'Send' that your message 
was nothing but a lot of hot air, slashdot fodder and a troll.  Would it 
not be logically more productive to direct FSF efforts instead towards 
funding Arch or SubVersion development?

	Jeff, a humble BitKeeper user and kernel developer
