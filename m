	Nonsense. Intellectual property is, conceptually, a form of contractual
property. If I pay you $10 to mow my lawn tomorrow, my right to compel you
to mow my lawn (or have you pay me damages) is a property right.

	If I develop an idea, I have the absolute right to the contents of my mind
and cannot be compelled to disclose the idea. Because the greater includes
the lesser, the right to not disclose the idea includes the right to
disclose the idea under terms, pursuant to a contract (actual or implied).

	Most property rights are contractual. You come to own property because you
contract for it.

	Because there was no need for them to do so. If I have possession of an
idea and agree to tell you the idea for $10 provided you agree not to
disclose the idea to anyone else, I don't need any special laws other than
the normal laws that permit me to make and enforce contracts.

	I think that you are right conceptually. Access restrictions are purely
contractual things and more obviously so. If I put a security restriction on
a CD and sell it to you, there's an implied agreement that you will respect
the restricitions. If I really wanted to, I could have you sign an agreement
to that affect.

	This would apply to employment contracts too.

	This is true for employment to. In fact, it's true for all contractual
agreements except for the sale of real property. If you hire me to mow your
lawn, how can I "willfully and completely surrender" one day of lawn mowing
in the next ten days to you at that time?

	Really, this is not a problem at all. Complex societies like ours
understand how to deal with intangible property rights. When you book a
hotel room in advance, the right to that hotel room on that day is an
intangible. It could, however, well be a transferrable property right that
you have. That's not a problem.

	You are confusing the right with the thing that the right is to. If I have
an idea, and I tell you that idea pursuant to an agreement that you will not
disclose the idea to others, the property I have is the right to pursue you
for damages should you disclose the idea. This is the same concept as if,
say, you sign a non-disclosure agreement. The right is not to the idea
itself, it's to pursue damages from those who violate their actual or
implied agreements not to disclose or use the idea without compensating you.

	But it is theft, as surely as if I pay you $10 to mow my lawn and you don't
mow my lawn. Violating a contractual agreement not to disclose and not
paying the damages the agreement specifies is a form of theft by fraud.

	You are trying to set back a complex society by arguing that only what you
can touch has legal meaning. But you can't touch the right to use an
apartment from June 1 to July 1. Yet if you agree to pay monthly rent for
the apartment, use the apartment, but don't pay, it's theft.

	Seriously, there is no problem at all here. You are needlessly and
senselessly manufacturing artitifical distinctions that make no sense.

	Then forget about copyright law entirely. Think only about contractual
property and the fact that a person who comes up with an idea cannot be
compelled to disclose it and can disclose it under any terms he or she
chooses. Think that when you buy a CD or a program, there's an implied
contract that the CD or program is for your personal use and that violating
that contract is as much theft as living in an apartment without paying
rent.

	Agreed. More sensible would be to look at whether the implied agreement
when you purchased that DVD included a promise to only use it on licensed
DVD players. An argument that is, IMO, nonsense.

	Further, there is no reason why the DMCA should have been enforced in cases
where no right recognized under copyright law exists because the DMCA was a
copyright law extension. As far as I know, a DVD seller has no legally
recognized copyright interest in what device I play that DVD on, and hence
CSS is *not* a copright enforcement mechanism.

	I totally disagree with the way the DMCA has been interpreted and hope that
there is a massive backlash.

	This is certainly not a right recognized under copyright law, so it's not a
right that can be enforced by a copyright enforcement mechanism. However,
this is a moral right that a content author has. Copyright law has taken
this away from content authors in the name of benefitting the public at
large.

	Copyright laws gave authors very little that they didn't already have.
Patent laws, on the other hand, give inventors many rights they would not
have otherwise.
