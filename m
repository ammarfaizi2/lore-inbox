Hi,

Does linux have target mode support for fibre-channel
?  i.e. can I have a linux machine fitted with a
fibrechannel card accept and service fibrechannel
requests from another host ? 

Basically, I want to construct a "RAID box" out of a
linux machine fitted with fibrechannel.   Other
machines should be able to talk to this machine and
treat this as a large disk volume.

thanks for any pointers,
Muthian
