Hi!

Does anyone know how to install the bttv 0.8.x and v4l2 driver for the
2.4.18 Kernel? I can't find any documentation concerning this, and I
even can't find the v4l2 sources. (does anyone know where I can find them?)
I've to install it because the bttv 0.7.x driver (+v4l) always crashes
my system when I try to use my TV-card (Hauppauge WinTV FM).

Btw: Can I install the bttv 0.8 and v4l2 drivers on the 2.2.20 Kernel? I
don't like the way the 2.4.18 Kernel does the memory-management, the
2.2.20 is much better.

Thanks!
Sacher
