Hi.

I posted about the same issue already to the list but that time I still
thought it might be an error with FAT32 so I repost the whole problem
under a new topic that perhaps others will become aware of it any may
help me.

The original post may be found under:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116291314500001&r=1&w=2

First of all my software/hardware data:
CPU: 2x DualCore Opteron 275
Mainboard: Tyan Thunder K8WE (S2895)
Chipsets: Nvidia nForce professional 2200, Nvidia nForce professional
2050, AMD 8131
Memory: Kingston ValueRAM 4x 1GB Registered ECC
Harddisks: 1x PATA IBM/Hitachi, 2x SATA IBM/Hitachi
Additional Devices/Drives: Plextor PX760A DVD/CD, TerraTec Aureon 7.1
Universe soundcard, Hauppage Nova 500T DualDVB-T card.
Distribution: Debian sid
Kernel: self-compiled 2.6.18.2 (see below for .config) with applied EDAC
patches

The system should be cooled enough so I don't think that this comes from
overheating issues. Nothing is overclocked.


Ok the problem is the following:
I copy large amounts of data (>15GB in several files each about 80MB,
but it happens even for smaller amounts so size does not seem to be
related) from one location to another.
Then I diff the two locations.
There are differences found!!!
When I do diff again I find again differences but mostly in other files
(so not always in the same place).
Sometimes there are not differences (but this is rare as I'm testing
with > 15GB)

I use this big size of data that the file chace is overwritten and diff
has to re-read the files from disk, if I repeat the diffing process.



What I suppose that I can tell from now is:

- the issue is unrelated to the filesystem (it happened on both FAT32
and even when I did the whole thing on ext3 only)

- my CPU is probably not damaged
I run a mprime/gimps torture test on each core (4) for over 16 hours,
and all calculations were correct

- I think memory isn't damaged, too.
I've run several passes with memtest86+ which lead to no errors and no
ECC errors.
But there was an issue with the debian version of memtest86+ that simply
freezed after a random number of passes (still without reporting any errors.

- I've also used EDAC_MC to look for errors,...
/sys/devices/system/edac# cat pci/pci_parity_count mc/mc0/ce_*
mc/mc0/ue_* mc/mc1/ce_* mc/mc1/ue_*
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
0
=> thus, if edac is right,.. no pci_parity errors no ecc errors
(Of course that diff issue happened during looking at edac results)

- the problem is not within diff.
If the file was still in the file cache my sha512 sums report
differences too (I've created for eac of the files hash sums)
Ok there may be an error with diff,.. in that it reads the data
incorrect... (and thus the data is incorrectly wirtten to the cache)
But this is very unlikely imho, anyway I'm going to do excessive
sha512sums checking to see if the issue also appears without using diff.

- I also tried the whole thing with preemtion voluntary... as a friend
told me about an similar problem that occured on sparc with forced
preemtion.


- One last thing: I noticed the whole issue due to extraction all of my
CD-DAs....
As I'm not satisfied by the Linux/Unix CD-Rippers,... I installed
Windows (I know I'm ugly ;) ) just to be able to use Exact Audio Copy (I
know it runs with wine but I don't trust that)...
Anyway... I ripped a lot of CD-DAs (which is now my test data) to wav files.
After each rip EAC calculates a crc32 of eac track...
Under Linux I did some tests with the files and diffs and so on,.. and
there I recognised the problem.

Now the interesting thing is, that windows was able to at least write
the data every time correctly.
Why? Well I've ripped each Audio-CD several times,... the CRC32 were
identical for each file (always).
When I diffed the different rips under linux (that was where I
recognised the problem) I had most of the time no differences.
Ok,.. now if Windows would have made a writing mistake it is very
unlikely that diff would ever hat reported equality, right?
So writing should be fine for windows.

Reading should be fine too in Windows. Why?
When EAC calculates the CRC32 it has to read the data (probably from
memory due to caching).... and the CRCs were always the same. This is at
least an indicator that reading works under Windows.
AND:
EAC hast its own "compare differen WAVs" method... and there I never got
an error.

This lets me assume that the issue is _not_ present under Windows
(although I'm not sure).



Any help/ideas/suggestion would be welcomed,.. :-) As I'm a more poor
than rich computer science student it would be a catastrophy if my 5000â‚¬
system (I'm so poor due to that system ^^) has some hardware damage :(


Thanks in advance and best wishes,
Chris.
