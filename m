Yes, that's true.  But that doesn't mean we can't make exceptions, we can
and do.

If *I* had suggested this language I would have been flamed off the face
of the earth.  The people who are complaining the loudest are complaining
that BitKeeper limits their choices or takes their freedom away or whatever.
They absolutely *despise* any sort of authority figure and the idea of 
coming begging to BitMover for a waiver each time just makes them crazy.

That said, what you outlined is more or less our current practice anyway.
It's not clear to me that changing the license in any way other than 
GPLing it will shut up the whiners, so my preference is to leave it the
way it is and let you ask for a waiver.  The effect is the same both ways.
