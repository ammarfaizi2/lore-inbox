www.kdebug.com.  They are still putting up the website and docs,
but it should go up soon.  It was written as a work for hire.  I do
not own it, but I did write it.   I was hired to write it and 
have been working on it for several months.  It's commercial 
quality kernel debugger for Linux.

I will ask them when they will have the site up.  From what I 
understand, they will be distributing the base version from 
the website at no charge, and charging for the SLD extensions.
  
:-)
