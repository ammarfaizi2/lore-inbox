Many kernel developers feel that when people use their GPL'ed Linux code
with the binary drivers they are giving up their IP to Nvidia.  That
argument is no less valid than Nvidia's.

Only a lawyer can answer the first question, and AFAIK there is not much
precedent in the area so it's especially important to get legal advice.
One would think Nvidia and ATI got the green light from their lawyers
before releasing the binary drivers, so who knows.
