I hate feeding lawyers
NVidia produce excellent gnu/linux/xfree drivers for their video cards, 
so I buy and use their hardware. Anybody else read Peter Hamiltons 
Misspent Youth yet ? Really quite interesting... But we've all done this 
argument to death hundreds of times, and linux-kernel doesn't care!

While we're so off topic, Happy New Year to all fellow gnu/linux hackers!
