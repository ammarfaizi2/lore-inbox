    Indeed - but unplugging your VCR from the wall won't harm it.

I disagree -- I have experience to the contrary.

Powering down a VCR whilst recording can damage the tape or even
worse have the tap get jammed in the video. I have also had a TV die
because it was unpowered from the mains without being switched off
first.

Sure, these things don't always happen -- but they sometimes do. I
would argue things like VCRs and TVs are just more tolerant than more
complex systems -- not immune.
