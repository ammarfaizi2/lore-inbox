At KS I asked after a gcapatch command for git..

I've got two trees drm-2.6 and linux-2.6, linux-2.6 is latest Linus, so of
course a tree diff gives me all the new patches in linux-2.6 that aren't
in drm-2.6 which isn't what I want.. I want gcapatch....

I'm sure someone has one and I don't really want to care about git
internals :-)

Dave.
