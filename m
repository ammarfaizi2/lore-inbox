 My love it knows no bounds
 You have awakened an unkindled fire
 It grows by leaps and bounds
 Larger than any pyre
 
 Rather than ending, just beginning
 To grow higher, and higher
 With only the sun up above
 All else, neath the fire
 
 Ecstasy growing
 Adventure and passion lie ahead
 Earth Shakers, down Thunder Road
 Trailing paths of glory, do we go
 
 Take my hand, my love
 We have many miles to explore
 Until we rest, adventure is with us
 Until we rest, adventure is with us
