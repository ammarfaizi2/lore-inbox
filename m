Michael,

Thank you for your interest in Buffalo's wireless products.
At this time, Buffalo does not support Linux for our wireless products.
We are working with our chip mfg on this issue and should have working Linux
drivers in the future but we cannot say when.

Keep posted to our website for the latest information.

Regards,

Dave Howell
