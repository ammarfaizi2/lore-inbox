Ok, enough Im sick of hearing this, we're NOT interested in your FUD. 

We don't need you or anyone else spreading FUD and SCOs (represented) view on 
here. 

We certainly don't need to listen to YOU spew your crap on here, it's 
OFF-TOPIC for one thing, and another don't troll here.

You've really irritated me at almost 5AM and I have better things to do then 
hear you blab about 'IP' crap.

</rant off>

Shawn.

no, i wont CC him directly.
