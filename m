I would say that that is a different thing. It "takes effort" to actually 
hide information, so in that sense, it's actually more expensive to try to 
keep it "non-free".

But that has nothing to do with the FSF kind of "freedom", the same way 
"no price" has nothing to do with that freedom.

So "information wants to be free" is more about "free as in beer", I'd 
argue. Trying to suppress information (or spread mis-information) takes 
real effort.
