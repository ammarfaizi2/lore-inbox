I never said that Alan, or any particular individual, should risk a lawsuit or
jail.  I simply said that I hoped *someone outside the US* (that is, someone not
subject to US laws) would make the information available.  Surely there are
places in the world that are beyond the reach of the DMCA.  How about those
European sites that made strong encryption available to circumvent the US export
restrictions on encryption technology?  I never heard of the FBI raiding any of
them.

   So you want to make the decision for Alan to get into a lawsuit and
possibly go to jail to fight the law? Will you pay his legal bills? Will
you take over his maintenance duties if necessary? Will you give him a
job when he's done if it comes to that?
   That's a personal decision, don't you think? Who can judge another
without knowing their circumstances? Do you understand the situation at
all? Truthfully, I don't.
