Then the correct fix here is to fix the LOOKUP_CONTINUE flag so that it
is set in the above situations.

Vetoed. LOOKUP_PARENT and LOOKUP_CONTINUE are _very_ different flags.
The former tells you what the goal of the lookup operation is. The
latter tells you about the current state of the lookup operation (namely
whether or not the VFS thinks it is on the last element of the path
lookup).

Cheers,
