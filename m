Hi everybody,

I've been getting a lot of requests lately for laptop-mode patches for
mainline Linux 2.6, from people who don't want to run -mm kernels.
People have been trying all sorts of things, including using very old
patch versions that I posted here months ago. I've prepared patches
against mainline 2.6.4 and 2.6.5 that include the latest changes in
laptop mode. They can be downloaded at my laptop mode page:
