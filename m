Have you ran the factory diag utility(s) to ensure the drives are "ok"?
(not that those tests are 100% as I own drives that pass those tests that
 are, in fact, bad.)  Have you made a complete bit image clone of the
drives (ala 'dd')? (how big are they?)

And there was a recent thread on linux-raid where someone had a drive
with bad internal cache memory -- a single bit was always '1'.  That one
gets an "I've never seen it do that before."
