Let me concur with the sentiments on this thread.

When I started using Linux, it was on a 40 MHz 386 with 8Megs of ram and
a 200 Meg HD.  This was a reasonably typical machine for the time (1993).
I ran X on this machine, and it was fine running several Xterms and you
could play the X version of Tetris or gnuchess.  I used this machine to
write the program I was working on for my Masters degree.

Today, a machine with specs like I quoted above seems hopelessly slow.
However, I was able to do useful work on it in 1993, and the same sort
of work would still be useful today.  You of course are not going to be
able to run mozilla and KDE on it, but lynx, slrn, mutt, and fvwm will
work fine.  There are many people who will never be able to afford
to buy a computer but could find someone to give them one of these
"hopelessy outdated" machines for nothing.  If we can ensure that
Linux keeps working on these machines, it will be a good thing.

Thanks,

Jim
