Nothing special about programming, this applies to television programs, acts 
of congress, the skill of most drivers on the highways, grocery shopping...

Fighting off Sturgeon's law is what maintainers DO.  It's why 90% of all 
patches are dropped...

It's also the core business of Red Hat, Google, Slashdot, Slashdot's 
moderation system, KernelTrap and Kernel Traffic...  (This isn't to say that 
the end result is less than 50% crud, just that they try very hard to change 
the percentages.  With varying degrees of success...)
