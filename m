There is nothing in the tcpa spec, they'd be foolish to put the _real_
agenda in the spec wouldn't they? :)

Because the only kernels that ISPs accept connections from are signed
and encrypted by the computer vendor - which means you _cannot_ trust
those kernels to not contain back doors.

The question is, if it is widely implemented in available hardware,
_will_ everyone be using it whether they want to or not?

Also, what about the law?  Remember, there have been attempts in the
