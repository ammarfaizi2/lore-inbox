Yeah, I know of those too. I lived in London when that case with the greengrocer 
or butcher or whatever was on. I think the guy was prosecuted.
That case was partially about the metric system, partially about EU legislation.
The UK government had agreed that by a certain date, all supermarkets etc.
would be required by law to mark all goods with a per 100g price. Not per ounce
or whatever. 
This is of course caused a few people to whine ....
And soon AFAIR, at least one supermarket turned around, and stopped also marking
goods in price per ounce etc. Downright silly.

Sooner or later, the IEC notation will also make it into the schools, and students
will be graduating knowing nothing but the IEC notation. If we haven't changed by 
then, that's when we'll see some true confusion.
