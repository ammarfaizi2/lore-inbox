Well, I'm certainly willing to spare the time to do it, but I'm not
sure that I'm particularly qualified to - the 2.4->2.6 doc would be
fairly straightforward for me, but documenting API changes in a useful
way may well require a better understanding of C than I have, (not
sure what I'd be letting myself in for - the only C I've done is
mainly games and other user mode stuff).

It's possible they might be, I'm not sure...
