In case of manufacturing, design, etc. the idea of release small, release
early
would be too costly for it to survive, me thinks.

Unless we had software to simulate a graphics chip and its software.
Like vmware but with emulation of hardware and software on that
virtual hardware. Lots of CPU power would be required there, but
then if we could write code for a virtual hardware emulator, "writing"
such a chip and then designing it would be feasible.
This is intriguing.
