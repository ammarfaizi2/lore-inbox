  The POSSIBLE reasons are FAQ items at the LKML FAQ:
	http://www.tux.org/lkml/

  Lately we have had bounces from lots of places, INCLUDING  @home.com !

  However in your case I see no such events.
  Everything seem to have worked just fine, until at circa 2:15 AM (EST)
  on 16th of march was the last letter to you.

  By the way, VGER's logs are not infinite,  only current plus 7 previous
  days.  Good that you didn't wait for a week before wondering...


  It *could* be that manual removal has happened, perhaps accidentally,
  perhaps intentionally, but I don't recall having done so.

  It could also be a result of a race condition in between manual removal,
  and Majordomo itself..  Never done that before...
