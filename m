All of which were space-stuffed by your (mozilla-derived) email client and
hence are unusable by users of non-MS-wannabe email clients.  They may also
be unusable by users of mozilla-based email clients, too - I don't know.

As far as I know there's no way to prevent mailnews-derived mail clients
from performing space-stuffing.  I've had a bug report in against it for at
least two years and all they've done is fartarse around with it.

IOW: please switch mail clients or use text/plain attachments.
