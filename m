How about not duplicating Rusty's list.  The way you have the Kprobes
stuff listed for example could disuade Linus from including it.  Only
the base kprobe patch was submitted, the rest were posted out of
kindness for those of us playing with it.  I'd hate to see the number
of patches work against it (especially since I requested the extra
patches.)
