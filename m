Yes, I remember.

The unused stuff in sound/isa/gus/* are for (everlasting :) future
development, e.g. WaveTable synth support.  So I don't think it's a
good idea to remove completely them.

The clean up of wavefront_fx.c was already performed on ALSA tree but
seems not merged yet in the mainstream.
