It is common for newspaper staff to be corrupt, same with magazine people.
Sometimes because people generally believe in a cause and are not impartial
(which I've seen both pro and anti Linux btw) and sometimes because advertising

There is a saying in he UK 'You can fool all of the people some of the time,
you can fool some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all of the
people all of the time'. You only have to look at the incredibly dim view
technical people take of most printed reviews to see that.
