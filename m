A one or two line summary at the top of an article often saves the
reader from reading the entire thing.

What does it say about changing the topic without changing the header?

Seriously, you have a point, but his two liner did not require the
context of the bulk of the post. There have been some far worse choices
of top posting, and the main reason for not top posting is because it's
hard to read *when context is needed*.

Your point is good, I think you could have picked a number of better
examples to make it.
