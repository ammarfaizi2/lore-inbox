Isnt the name "Novell ..." already a giveway? This is some kind of 
corporate management artifact. Someone wants to do something good for the 
poor Linux community that has no debuggers available and they just got 
something from somewhere that is going nowhere (merger?). They are in the 
period clueing in to opensource. Just give them some time .....

Hint to Novell Management : You own SuSE who 
has provided KDB with their kernel for quite some time.
