I would like to add some further context to why I've had to take the
regretable course of action I have.

Firstly, I admit to accidentally applying David's patch, which I'm sorry
for doing.  However, that can't be undone.

However, we have discussed the issue of the DPA by private email.  When
I didn't reply for a period of 1h15, he noticed me on IRC and started
hounding me for an answer to his mail.  When I declined to give an
answer until OSDL have completed their investigation, but this wasn't
satisfactory.  The hounding continued.  Not surprising one eventually
gets annoyed.

So, because David couldn't get the answer he wanted, he's decided to
make the whole thing public as in his first mail to this list.

I feel that this hardly the attitude of a mature individual wishing to
resolve a difference of opinion.  It merely serves to cause alienation
and confrontation.

So, regretfully, this leaves me with the only option but to ignore
David via all forms of communication until the reason for deference
is resolved - namely the completion of OSDLs investigation.
