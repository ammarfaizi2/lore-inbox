And you're asking me? ;)
While getname() has a check for user/kernelspace - do you really
care about "the overhead" for a function call level with 1 argument?
Uhm, probably if you even care to write this..

What is the cost for switching the segments?
But I agree that sys_unlink should be the fast call and dumping core
is the exception :)

would fastcall do_unlink() help? I guess the arg is then passed in a
register
