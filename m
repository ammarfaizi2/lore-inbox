Which directory do you suppose exactly?  drivers/media/tv (or
something like that), or existing one like drivers/media/video?

I personally have no big objection to move snd-bt87x location.
although the external alsa-driver tarball would require a tune.
It was there simply because the driver is basically independent from
other layers but sound.  From the functionality viewpoint, it's better
to gather all modules, of course.

One point I'm conerned is, however, the order of objects in the
built-in kernel.  Recently we had a problem of initializations of
saa7134-alsa and sound core stuff.  We should be careful about that.

Also, more intutive Kconfig would be nice to have.  For example, it'd
be better to use a choice type for saa7134-alsa and -oss drivers.
Also, to my eyes, it's better to select CONFIG_SND from saa7134-alsa
instead of depending on it.
