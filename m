Literally from XFree86 4.3, or from DRI CVS? The latter would be better,
as the former is no longer actively maintained.

There's no need for a separate directory, the DRM has been backwards
compatible since 4.2 at least, and countless bugs have been fixed since
then.

It would also be great if you could isolate DRM fixes in the kernel and
post patches here - some kernel developers keep complaining how broken
the DRM code is, but never submit patches...
