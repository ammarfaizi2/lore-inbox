Hi linux-kernel staff.

    I have a big problem!
    Each time I try to intall an Linux OS, on my machine, it crashes
with "Kernel Panic"!
    I tried to install
    - "Fedora 4"
    - "Kurumin 4.0"
    - "Kurumin 5.0"

    In fact, "Kurumin" is a Live CD, and worked as an Live CD ONLY,
although,
when I tried to install it on my hard drive, it failed the
initialization after the LILO run!!!
    None of the Linux OS were able to detect the best "window size" of
the screen,
so I had to manually input it!!

    These are the components of my machine:

Motherboard
    ASUS P5GDC-V Deluxe LGA775 i915G
    DDR2, PCI-e, GLAN

CPU
    Intel Pentium IV, 530, 3.0 GHz
    1MB LGA775, with Hyperthreading.

RAM
    Kingston 512MB DDR
    400MHz CL3

3D Board
    Intel 82915G Express Chipset Family
    Internal, 64 MB

Hard Drive
    Western Digital, 120 GB
    7200rpm, 8MB Bf. SATA


Could it be something about the "Hyperthreading" thing, or hard drive
being SATA,
or maybe the 3D Board because of not detecting it??
Could you please help me?


Best Regards,
Fernando Rocha
