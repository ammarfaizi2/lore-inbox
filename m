  I figured as much.  I just had to explain that one to an otherwise 
very-computer-savvy friend.  He couldn't figure out why he couldn't get 
the serial console to work on his Ultra 10, so I told him I'd take a look. 
He pulled out his DB9-DB9 null modem cable, and I asked him if he had a 
DB25 adapter. He was rather confused...but not for long.
  You can be smart, but it won't help when you need SPARC smarts. :)
