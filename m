Well, but if you made a more advanced SCM tool, then yes, you improved
on Clearcase.  Therein lies the flaw in your arguement - you're saying
the community needs to start really innovating, but really - what's
innovation?

If BK is better off because of user feedback, and you said above those
users used Clearcase, BK is at least part a copy of Clearcase.  There's
no way around that - every person who creates has influences.  In BK's
case that influence is indirect, but c'mon - without that feedback,
which is based on Clearcase, BK would be something different.
You're asking people to not have any influences.

How did you find that "best", if it didn't come failed attempts?  Were
you born with an image of the ideal SCM tool in your head?  Did you
stumble upon it in the woods one day?  I don't see how the idea could've
developed without influences.
