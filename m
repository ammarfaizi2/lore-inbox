Please show me the case law which says we have to give you our technology,
for free, and we do not have the right to say "no way unless you agree to
not reverse engineer".

Lots of law says "if you paid for this product, the seller may not impose
the following restrictions" with reverse engineering being amongst those.

I do not have any data which says that the same law applies in the case of
a no charge copy of the software, do you?
