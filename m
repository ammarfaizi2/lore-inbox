"As such, clients will not be allowed to alter the code in any form and
may not give any other party access to any aspect of that code."

Does this preclude one reading the source and then using
the knowledge gained to write, independently, working

Does anyone on the list have access to the code?

It seems to me this might be an opportunity...
