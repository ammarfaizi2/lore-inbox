Hi,

I guess I made a jump from 2.4.26 directly to 2.6.9 or maybe even 
higher, but I can't remember if I used the scanner since then, most 
probably is that it was last used it in 2.4.x.

Is mentioned in previous post, I can do as much as possible to help, 
including testing patches and/or recompiling the kernel in any way needed.


Sorry for posting to 2 gropus but I'm not subscribed to any, and I'm not 
sure to which (if any) was this reply sent to too.
