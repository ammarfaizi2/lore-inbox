i decided to use kernel-2.4.0-test10 again. But while unpacking the 
archive the tar-program hangs and the kernel says :
hda: lost interrupt

this doesn´t stop.

I´ll reboot now.

At this time reporting errors is the only way i can help. But i´m on this 
list since a few hours only, so maybe i´m reporting too much.
So please tell me when i should stop it.

Best regards
Oliver Poths
