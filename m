Hi,

When compiling 2.5.9-dj1 with modular MD/LVM and EXT3, I got the
following unresolved symbols:

% depmod -ae -F System.map -b debian/tmp-image -r 2.5.9-dj1
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
         debian/tmp-image/lib/modules/2.5.9-dj1/kernel/drivers/md/md.o
depmod:         blk_get_readahead
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
         debian/tmp-image/lib/modules/2.5.9-dj1/kernel/fs/jbd/jbd.o
depmod:         exit_files

Seems like some missing EXPORT_SYMBOL statements.

My .config is attached.
