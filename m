It is no more about the kernel than a question about liability is about
auto racing just because your particular interest is in cars. The GPL
applies to many kinds of software, and your question is totally general.

Yes, it clearly asks a question about the GPL in general, since it applies
equally to all covered software. All the protesting on earth will not
change the point, you are asking a license question which is not kernel
specific.

I read the post carefully, you are a non-customer who didn't get what he
wanted for free and tried to make your complaint sound like a legitimate
question. You faild.
