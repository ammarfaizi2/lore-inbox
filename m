Substatiate your accusation or go away.  I see nothing in
his followup that even hints that there was any private
communication.  He quotes what you posted in this public
forum and addresses that, and that only.

Like most here i often disagree with Larry (though not about
his right to pick his own licence and enforce it) and find
his statements or the manner of them irritating but in this
case his response is exactly on the mark and except for his
friendly suggesting you might work for him matches my
initial reaction to your post.

Accepted.  A very nice and mild response on your part.  My
apologies for this posting too but when someone does
well as you have with that posting he aught not be met
with the above reaction.
