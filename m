I think you're just arguing for the sake of argument, which basically sums

Let me put it in simple terms: you've got an alarm clock, haven't you?  When 
you set the alarm, you don't need to have any little light on the front that 
tells you the alarm is set, do you?  Because, after all you're not stupid, 
you know you set it.  And you can always get out of bed and look at the 
position of the switch, right?

(I hope I just demonstrated the difference between reducto ad absurdum and 
'just plain silly'.)
