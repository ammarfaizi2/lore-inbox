Subject: 2.4.7: still trouble with ipfilter and pppoe

Hi hackers,

sadly starting Limewire on a client in the internal network still causes
my 2.4.7 gateway to lockup up hard solid. I was hoping, 2.4.7 would fix it
due to the new pppoe patches, but it doesn't. There is no oops and no core
in the filesystem.

Any ideas? I'd be happy to provide any information requested.

Regards,
Daniel
