No offense to anyone intended, but since this most recent discussion is
on the _original_ thread, perhaps some of you have not read the latest
"v3" version of the patch. It does make a bunch of the recent comments
irrelevant (some of the recent discussion, however, is very
interesting.)

If that thread is lost to most normal people by now, and they don't
wantto go gooja-surfing, I'll find a place on the web to put this stuff
up.
