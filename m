One thing though. While this is the list to receive job announcements, you
should sent the job offers to me instead. For some reasons spammers love
emails with word "job" in it and I get tons of spam to that address, so it
is easy to miss the job offers with huge amount of 'd' going on.

If someone could update FAQ to reflect this, it would be great.
