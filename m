Does anyone have a tested example of tunneling mode working on
linux-2.6-test2?  If so would you please email it to me.  At this point
I don't care about authentication method, don't care about addresses,
etc.  I just want to see a real example.

I have tried the Linux Magazin "Sicherer Transport" examples, and the
Linux Advanced Routing & Traffic Control HOWTO examples, but cannot get
them to work.  They fail with a message of 
"The result of line xxx: Invalid argument. " message.

Thanks

Jim Penny
