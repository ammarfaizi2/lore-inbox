Hello everyone

I too have started to experience this problem, starting with 2.6.2-rc3. The symptom is, the mouse goes crazy... erratic, and every movement of the mouse clicks on things. Menus fly... programs open. It lasts for a few seconds. If I stop moving the mouse for a few and then click somewhere, it comes back to normal. This message is seen in the output of dmesg afterwards.

psmouse.c: MX Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.

It happened 4 times in one day, so I went back to 2.6.1 and it did not happen again. Today, I did 2.6.2 and have been running it all day. It didn't happen until just a few minutes ago.

I only have one mouse configuration section in my XF86Config file (I did some searching and saw this problem can be caused by having duplicate sections)

Section "InputDevice"

# Identifier and driver

    Identifier	"Mouse1"
    Driver	"mouse"
    Option "Protocol"    "IMPS/2"
    Option "Device"      "/dev/psaux"
    Option "ZAxisMapping"  "4 5"
    Option "Buttons"      "5"
    Option "Resolution"   "500"

Ok, I know you folks don't like attachments, so I'll just paste my config and dmesg output to this email should anyone care to peruse it.

This is a pentium4 system, with an i845 based Gigabyte motherboard. Nothing fancy or weird in this box. The mouse is a logitech MX500 optical wheel mouse.

The top part of dmesg is truncated, because of all the noisy atkbd.c: unknown key released messages, of which there are now double because of the "this is an xfree86 bug".

However, the kernel is 2.6.2 and the compiler used was gcc 3.3.2
