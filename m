Perhaps this is good reason to delay the freeze for an additional 2 weeks or 
so?  I fail to see the necessity of rushing into a freeze, especially when 
it seems obvious that people are trying to merge code which hasn't been 
adequately tested.  I think Hans Reiser and others have brought up valid 
points that the freeze is happening too soon.  I tend to agree, especially 
looking back at the timetable surrounding 2.1.X development.  Since I'm not 
a contributor, I know my opinion doesn't count for much.  Still, as a user 
I think it is important not to write of new features just because they 
didn't make the "arbitrary" freeze date.  Again, I really don't see what 
the rush is all about.

Just my .02 (US),
Nicholas
