/me too. Watching .m2v Videos with mplayer (mplayer.sourceforge.net) results 
in a bit slower Playback. I don't had the problems until i switched to the 
latest ac-Patches.. I really think, that this can be lead back to the change 
of the vm in the ac-tree. Before, i sometimes switched between linus kernel 
tree, and ac-patches, and always i got the result, that playback seemed to be 
a bit slower with linus kernel. Hope this helps.
