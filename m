    Another problem area is ECC monitoring.  I'm still waiting for
    info from ServerWorks, and so is Dan Hollis.  Alexander Stohr has
    even submitted code to Jim Foster for approval, without evident

    so the matter is not academic.

Add environemt monitoring. One mf my play machines is a dell 2540,
dual AC power, lots os fans and temperature sensing, I'd really like
to be able to get this information from it (yeah, closed source Dell
drivers are worth almost zero).
