Anyone know if Tekram's DC315/DC395 SCSI driver will be incorporated
into the kernel distribution?  I think their driver is GPL, or was there
some other reason it wasn't incorporated?

Their source code is on their website...

Just wonderring... (unfortunately I had a DC315 for a day but had to give
it up... it was the worst of the AHA2940A and DC390F that I already
had...)
