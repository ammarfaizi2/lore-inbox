The reason for that is because patch-2.5.1-pre1 is just basicly the inode 
fix and some other things well and the version number change from 2.5.0 to 
2.5.1-pre1.
The 2.5.0 is just the same as 2.4.15 except for the version numbers. And one 
more thing 2.5.1-pre2 mite have already fixed something in main.c that it 
can not go back and change for the kdb patch.
