IMHO the RIAA and MPAA are playing their role perfectly.  While they
_may_ represent pure greed, that greed produces things - mass market
music and films, mass market "stardom" to believe in and follow - that
large numbers of people still want, even though there are plenty of
readily available alternatives.

So long as people want the things that RIAA and MPAA are involved in
creating, but do not want to pay for it, _and_ for the most part just
want to copy because they enjoy saving money, rather than really
thinking through how to create a better, fluffier world, with
sustainable economics in a new form, then the RIAA and MPAA _must_ do
what they do - a role is created, and they fulfil it.

Just ignore the RIAA and MPAA, and listen/watch other stuff.
There's plenty of it.  And support the creators of stuff you like.

If only a few people do that, they may end up stuck in paid-for laws.
If a lot of people do it, though, problem solved.

IMVHO of course :)
