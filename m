Not for nothing, lists are for discussion. PERIOD. I didn't see a label
that said, "This is a *technical* discussion list only.  Only post
*technical* discussions here."  If that were the case, you would be
blocking THIS post and all of the people posting to it as well.  This
discussion is HIGHLY not of the technical nature, and *YOU* started it. 
So getting back to what Alan said, "If you think
rms should be blacklisted I'd like to propose you are blacklisted too
for being dangerously naiive"  And IMO, also for being so very
illogical.  Also you would be blocking half of the people posting to
this list because a good deal of the posts to this list could be
considered "not technical" or "not related to the linux kernel."  The
email client gods made filters for a reason, to block things *YOU* don't
like, and honestly it seems that *YOU* are the only person complaining.
