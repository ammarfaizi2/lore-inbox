There IS one central spam filter already, but apparently a 100:1
ham:spam ratio is not good enough for some people.  Do you have any idea
what this list would look like if there were no filtering at all?

At some point you just have to say it's good enough, that to filter any
more aggressively would entail an unacceptable risk of false positives,
and that the small minority for whom a single spam is intolerable can do
their own filtering.
