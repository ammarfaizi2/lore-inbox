Hi Stephen,

I have the same Stephen's problem, because  I didn't receive any messages from
tuesday.
I tried to use several POP3 client (kmail, and so on) and I verified that my
email account works fine because I receive every days messages from my
friends.

I didn't read any messages (linux-kernel messages) from Friday (because I was
on vacation) and my mail box became large more than 3 Mb (the max allowed by
my mail server) and probably my ISP sent back a lot of  'relaying denied' and
then my account has been revoked.

I downloaded from the mail server all the old messages and I run also the tool
in http://vger.kernel.org/mxverify.html that Matti suggested to Stephen and it
gave me an OK result.

Can someone of you tell me if it is possible re-activate my account. If no,
can you tell me how I can receive your messages.

Thanks in advance for your help.
