I put together some graphs showing the evolution of features for the
2.5 kernel here:

http://kernelnewbies.org/status/Linux_Kernel_2_5_Compounded_Progress.png

Since most features evolve over time as opposed to being a one-time 
deal, it does pretend to be fully accurate but it does give a good 
sense of the development lifecycle.
Funny how the rate of merges grew rapidly just before feature freeze :-)

Enjoy!
