People on the list have recently expressed dissatisfaction with cdrecord 
and its development process, and IIRC one person appeared to volunteer 
to prototype an alternative (I couldn't find the original 
email/author).  I found a project just now which may be of interest: 
http://icculus.org/burn/.  It is obviouslly not as well-known and 
developed as cdrecord. 

Hope this email doesn't raise the noise/signal ratio on LKML too much
