    OK, I understand now... Completely broken... Have you any actual
proof or should I use my faith and just believe it is completely
broken?

    Anyway, forget about it. As you suggest in other message, my way
of writing software is so poor ('cause I think that the junk Matthias
wrote is good for me) that probably I won't understand your
explanation. You know, that's the problem with stupid people like me,
that we don't understand what people say to us, so there's not point
in explaining. You do the right think and don't provide facts,
because nobody is clever or talented enough to understand them.
