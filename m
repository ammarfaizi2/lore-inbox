Okay, Linus decreed... oh yeah.

Exactly what is wrong with the method anyway?

You on Crack?

And no... that is not a decree in the traditional sense. It is more like
me saying:
        "I decree that Linus Torvalds is the lead maintainer of the
        Linux Kernel"

Make TONS-O-SENSE to state the obvious. IOW the statement was all meant
to say *DO IT THIS WAY AND NO OTHER* as nobody else honors any other
method.
