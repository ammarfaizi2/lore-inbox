I seen the article on CNN's web site this morning. I also looked at other 
news sites. I found the CNN article very smearing of the linux community. 
There is no evidence that it is from the linux community but yet CNN 
blames us. I find it very insulting. I recommend that everyone write a 
letter or call CNN about this. We need to stop the FUD.
