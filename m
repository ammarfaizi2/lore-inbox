  Bounces to where ?

  The bounces ARE in MIME, but frobbing them into HTML is ...
  That would involve my dead body, which I am not keen on supplying.

  And for that matter, people who you do want to punish do run MUAs, which
  happily open up everything -- except these bounce reports VGER generates.
  But then, vger sends those reports to linux-kernel-owner, who needs no
  additional punishment...
