>From what I've heard, the earliest versions of Linux were
cross-compiled on a Minix system. I've stored one of Linus' old
postings about the earliest days, and in his famous "Do you pine for
the nice days of minix-1.1, when men were men and wrote their own
device drivers?" message announcing linux is this note:

> standalone system for those of you without minix.
