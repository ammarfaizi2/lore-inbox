I expect the next thing that will happen is that they will get patents on
key portions of their protocols and then start enforcing them.

With the various IP laws that have been passed in the last few years in
the US (and through WIPO) they will have a large brick to try and hit us
with. (IMHO these laws pretty much allow large entities to buy their
markets and are the biggest threat to innovation out there.)

Actually I am sending copies of his rant out to all of my friends who
still use Microsoft products.

If that is the attitude they have towards their customers and the
development community then it is time to get away while you still can.

Of course, the reason I moved over all my development to Linux in the
first place what that I did not have to worry about being screwed over by
a "corporate strategy" or have the license terms changed on the next
release or have to pay for something over and over again in the vain
attempt to get something to work.

With Linux I can read the source.  There are no hidden interfaces. No
mystical archane knowledge that you have to pay the company to learn get
the job done.  It is all there and it all works.  (Or if it does not, then
the tools exist to make it work.)

I wonder what kind of law they will try to push to outlaw Open Source?

If this is his idea of "The American Way" then he needs to take a basic
civics course.  He obviously slept through the last one.
