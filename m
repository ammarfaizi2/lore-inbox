   A while back I reported this problem, which seemed to be ignored.
   Almost a week ago I switch to a DGE500T instead of a DGE550T. All
problems went away.
   I tried 2 different DGT550Ts. So, possibly, I received 2 broken ones.
If not, then it sure appears there is a problem somewhere with this NIC
and the Samba transfers.
