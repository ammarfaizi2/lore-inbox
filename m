I've heard that accusation many times, and on investigation, on the 
occasions I could be bothered, it's _always_ turned out to be false - 
generally caused by cluelessness on the part of the reporter.

It's very easy for ISPs to get landed in ORBS by customers who use the
outgoing relay for spam which they've wrongly accepted. The ISP's mail
relay doesn't have to accept the mail from the outside world and blatantly
forward it.
