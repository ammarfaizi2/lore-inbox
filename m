Let me quote you, from 2 emails back in the thread:

 "The fact that the open source portions and the closed source portions
  can't function on their own is irrelevant, IMHO."

The irrelevance here is IYHO ... it may well be judged that
since these two portions of the work need each other in order
to function, the thing really is one work.

You're well into the danger zone here...
