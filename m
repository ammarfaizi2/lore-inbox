I figured that people here would know.  If you were looking for blade
servers and you were more interested in cost and heat generation than the
most performance, what would you buy?  We're looking for 20 x86 cpus.
They have to beat ASUS terminators (nice little boxes, if you haven't
checked them out you should, about $100 + cpu + mem + disk and they are
quiet and run on ~100watt power supplies so they don't generate a lot
of heat).

So far, the stuff at www.rackmount.com looks pretty good but they are
(like everyone else so far as I can tell) focussed on performance.
For all of the Unix like platforms, we'd be happy with 2Ghz Athlons (don't
need opterons) with 256MB.  It's true that for the windows platforms we
like 2GB because we use 1GB as a ram disk to get reasonable performance
out of @#!! Windows.

Thanks in advance,
