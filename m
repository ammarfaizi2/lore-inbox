I am posting to this mailing list since it is Development related and it
isnt a HOWTO question.

I am looking for a book that is similar to The Design of the UNIX Operating
System by Maurice J. Bach but also for the Linux OS.  Is this book still
relevant to Linux even thought it isnt the "same"?  I have heard bad reviews
of Linux Internals by Moshe Bar and was wondering what would be a better
book for the deep internals of the OS....not exactly going over the code.
