Hello,
We have purchased Quad Opteron (852) processor based server board from Tyan
(S4881). This board is built with 64GB of RAM & 72.0GB SCSI Hard Disk drive.
The same solution was sold on Rack mount config to a client.

 When the client tries to install RHEL 3.0 Advanced Server with update 3 &
SMP kernel, the same installation itself hangs immediately after boot. The
client wants to have kernel 2.4.21-20 SMP on the same distro of Linux,
because they are using SYNOPSYS tool which is stable only on this version of
Linux & kernel.

Can you please help us in resolving the matter? We have tried installing
Fedora Core 4 with 2.6.11 kernel SMP ver. This works fine, but the SYNOPSYS
tool is not stable. 

Further the client has purchased the same config server from HP (DL585).
This server is presently working fine under the RHEL 3.0 Advanced Server
with update 3 on SMP kernel 2.4.21-20.

The HP server is based on AMD 8000 series chipset and the client s saying
that the NVIDIA chipset based servers are not good. Please help in resolving
this issue kindly.
