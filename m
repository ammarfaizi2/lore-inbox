Subject: 2.6.x: iowait problem while burning a CD

Hi,

[hoping that my English is comprehensible...]

trying to burn a CD "on the fly" I have noticed a strange thing. During the 
burning "iowait" remains enough low (~3%, MAX 10%) but, after a little 
time, it suddenly and quickly goes up to 80-90%: in this condition MKFS 
seems unable to fill the FIFO buffer as quickly as the CD-writer writes  
-->  so the amount of data in the buffer is in "free fall" and sometime the 
buffer becomes empty (in this case I must thank the BurnFree technology ;)
After this peak IOWAIT returns on reasonable values, the buffer is filled up 
and all work fine until IOWAIT goes up newly.

KERNEL: 2.6.3 (but I see this also on 2.6.0.... so I think it affects all 
2.6.x kernels)

Cdrecord 2.00.3
K3B 0.11.5

MINIMAL-CONFIG is appended (I have tried to disable CONFIG_PREEMPT and this 
seems to reduce the problem, but doesn't eliminate it)

Any ideas?
