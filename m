I lived in times when even typewriters (and SURELY copiers) all had to be
registered in a 'competent organizations'.

social
social contract (right?). we pay govt so they will protect us against
disasters, foreign enemies nad crime.
that thing transformed into counter-thing. govt thinks that crowd is
dumb-silent and finally about 160 millions of slaves (or prisoners).
this is the 'final destination' to which lead such attempts of total control
:(

unfortunately 98% don't care about such things. they sit on their g-spots
and drink vodka (or something). they DON'T NEED computers. or anything else
except their drinks.

and govt surely prefer that all citizens became such silent lambs. and
easy controlled idiots.

the one difference between govt and corporations - corporations want
citizens become idiots that generate money and gift it to a corporate CEO :)
