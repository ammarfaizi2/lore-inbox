Well that's exactly my problem :)

I reckon it should be off by default because the threat posed by
this problem is IMHO small compared to some of the other standard
threats that are applicable to TCP.  Plus this is a well-documented
feature so we can't be sure that someone somewhere isn't depending
on it.

However, if it were off by default then there is very little value
in providing it at all since the same thing can be achived easily
through netfilter.

Anyway, let's leave it to Dave to make the decision.

Cheers,
