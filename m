See Erik Mouw's reply for enlightenment.  But yes, some patches do sit
in the patch system without explaination for some time, until I find
the incentive or interest to do something with them.

(Side note: it would be interesting to find out how many people believe
that those 17 patches sitting in my incoming queue should be applied to
a 2.4 stable kernel tree:

Anything above and including 837/1 are 2.5 material anyway.)
