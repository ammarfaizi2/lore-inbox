let me point it out then:

you wrote this disputing a point of mine that Mathieu acknowledged 
meanwhile, and which you now acknowledge in this mail too:

and as i wrote to Mathieu, this differene in markup can have performance 
impact on the code generated by gcc, so it can be of practical 
relevance. Unfortunately i dont have much influence on the fact that it 
takes so much time for you to understand and acknowledge such simple 
points: in this highly trivial case it was 3(!) mail exchanges =B-) 
Yuck! I should really heed others' advice that i should simply stop 
replying to you ... but i have to admit that often it's so tempting.
