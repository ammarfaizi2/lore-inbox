Licenses are a lot like signing a lease.  Things are negotiable and
we're reasonable people (contrary to public opinion).

bk export -tpatch is just fine.  So is bk -r diffs -up.  Done all the
time, no license violation, no problem except apparently for you.

I think your concern is based on the desire to create a competing
system.  That skates you right up agains the license restrictions but
those restrictions are simply not a problem for people who are just
trying to get their job done.
