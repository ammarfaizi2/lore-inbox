You can dual license any work. Someone who receives growisofs under this 
license would not be allowed to redistribute it without permission granted 
therein. However, if that same person receives growisofs under the GPL 
license, the GPL terms apply. A GPL license only applies if the person has 
received the software under those terms. While most GPL'd software is 
available online under the GPL license, making it effectively everyone to 
receive the license, it is not necessary.

However, that applies only for that particular license. If the publisher 
obtains the rights elsewhere (eg, the GPL licensed version), then they may do 
so provided they comply with the rest of the GPL terms. Note that the GPL 
prohibits distributing growisofs linked to non-GPL-compatible software. Thus, 
if Solaris is not under a GPL-compatible license, the GPL prohibits 
distributing growisofs with it.
