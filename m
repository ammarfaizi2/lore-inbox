In case you've forgotten, this is the Linux Kernel Development List, for
DEVELOPERS.  Take your cyber-political, cyber-theology, and
cyber-philosophy elsewhere!  This is not an Oxford debate forum; it is a
medium for those that write the source code.  Move your discussion to a
separate list.  If none exists, create one, say "linux-vision" (as in
vision for the future) or "linux-pholosophy".

Just to recap, YES IT'S DEAD! GET OVER IT AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR LIVES!
