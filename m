If the binary only module in question sticks with the "published
interface" (as is required) isn't it a problem in Linux then?

} look buddy, you don't get it
} without access to nvidia's source, we can't know what it does, where it does
} it, and what we can break by doing what to the kernel
} WE CAN NOT KNOW SO WE CAN NOT PREVENT IT
} it is THAT simple
} complain to nvidia, not the people that CAN NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
