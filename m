I encountered a similar problem with USB except mine was kind of an 
opposite issue.  With USB compiled in it didn't work, with USB as a 
module it did work.

for both linux-2.4.19-rc3 and linux-2.4.19-rc3-ac5 the following config 
did not work (USB compiled in):

#
# USB support
#
CONFIG_USB=y
# CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is not set

#
# Miscellaneous USB options
#
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
# CONFIG_USB_BANDWIDTH is not set
