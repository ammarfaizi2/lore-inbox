All,

On two seperate motherboards that I have been testing, the ABIT
KR7A-RAID and the SOYO FIRE DRAGON, 2.4 kernels panic on boot up during
IDE initialization.  I don't really know how to track down the problem but
now that I've seen it on two boards I'm a bit worried.  This does not
happen with 2.2 kernels so it is 2.4 specific.  I have tested with 2.4.17
and 2.4.18 pre releases.  I will try to field any questions to solve the
problem.  Please CC me directly on any correspondence as I am not
currently subscribed to this list.

Thanks,
