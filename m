So would I.  But I definitely wouldn't write
	for (i = 0; i < 10; i += 2)
because I prefer the grouping in
	for (i=0; i<10; i+=2)

Pavel may have picked a bad example, but there are cases when spaces can
be used to group code.  Just as empty lines can be used to group code.
And in both cases the reason should be "readability".

Which variant is the most readable is a highly personal matter and may
alos change over time for any group of people.  I'd vote against a stone
tablet with 10 commandments of taste.  "Make it readable, use common
sense" is so much better, imo.
