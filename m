I give, I'm not going to convince you and you're not going to convince me.
I think that I'm making a mistake by arguing with people who aren't trying
to build a company.  Of course you're right, you have the advantage that
you don't have to put your theories to the test nor do you have employees
who have to find new jobs if your theories are wrong.  Forgive me if I
don't mix your theories into my practice.
