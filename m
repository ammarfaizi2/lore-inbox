Greetings;

Just a quick note to advise that the above patch works very well 
indeed in the testing I just did with my Sony DCR-TRV460 movie 
camera.  I was even able to watch it in live mode, which I wasn't 
able to do before.  Good patch, please make sure it gets into 2.6.12 
if not before.

Cheers, Gene
