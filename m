Yeah, he did, but he's dead, and we shouldn't talk ill of the dead. So 
these days I can only rant about Niklaus Wirth, who took the "structured 
programming" thing and enforced it in his languages (Pascal and Modula-2), 
and thus forced his evil on untold generations of poor CS students who had 
to learn langauges that weren't actually useful for real work.

(Yeah, yeah, most _practical_ versions of Pascal ended up having all the 
stuff necessary to break structure, but as you may be able to tell, I was 
one of the unwashed masses who had to write in "standard Pascal" in my 
youth. I'm scarred for life).
