Subject: Does the F--king via 82c686b record at all!!!!!!!!

I have posted before about not being able to record on the VIA 82c686B
Southbridge chip. I never got it to record using the kernel
via82cxxx_audio.  I sent emails to the maintainer at mandrake just to
find out if the driver was capable of recording. Nothing.

I did hear from about 3-4 others with the same problem, plays ok, just
can't record. Records perfectly under Windows.

Ok, I go to alsa and get the 5.12a drivers and install them. Guess what
plays everything ok, but no f--king record. Only difference is instead
of playback being squewks and squawks, it is silence. According to the
docs on via's site the alsa driver record should work.

So, DOES ANYBODY HAVE RECORD CAPABILITIES USING THE VIA 82C686B
CHIP????????
And if so could you contact me so I might be able to find out the
problem I have here.

I have a  DFI AC74-EC Via KT133 chipset mobo.
Linux 2.4.16

I apologize for using the strong language. But, I hope it will get the
attention of somebody who might be able to actually help.
