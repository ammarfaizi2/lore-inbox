Actually, to be legal, you need say GNU/Linux (Linux is a registered
trademark of Linus Torvalds).

As for the ethics, "cite the main developer"?  Well, then, that's easy.
It is you and the FSF organization which are behind this GNU stuff and
since I've been around since before you started, I'm well aware of 
how much work you did and how much was work that was simply assigned
over to the FSF.  If we remove all the work that you did not do, then
it's vividly clear that Linux is a larger effort.

The vast majority of the GPLed software out there is not work that you
did, it is work that other people did.  You are claiming credit for
their work, which is way over the unethical line, and attempting
to infringe on the work of the Linux community.  Not nice.
