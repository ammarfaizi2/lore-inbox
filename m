In my experiences, 2.6.8 and above have been quite unstable for me.  I was
able to crash 2.6.8.1 as a normal user over nfs (I thought that was fixed?)

2.6.9 gave me problems with USB and random lockups.  2.6.7 has been fairly
stable for me, but I honestly do not see 2.6 as a stable kernel.  From my
past experiences, 2.4.x (low numbered) was just as stable as 2.6 has been or
more so.
