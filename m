Good morning,
	Perhaps this isn't the correct list to ask this, but
is there a site, does any one have, know of the existance
of a driver for the Efficient 3060 DSL modem? Even if the
driver in question is in beta, development, whatever, I 
don't really care.

Thanks for your help in advance,

--Ed
