Chris,

Yes, I do remember that post.  But i'm not arguing from an ideological
basis; i'm arguing on practical grounds that the price of using BK is too
high for its supposed benefits.  I've not seen anyone else make that
argument here on the list and it is something that Linus may not have
given full consideration to.   At least the comment that you quote gives
no consideration to it at all.

Cheers,
Sean
