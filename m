I tend to agree with you though I did want to mention that I've got
2.4.18 running on my 386 without any problems so far, just because it's
pretty neat that it works so well.  The machine spends a bit more time
in swap I think which makes some things slow down but that could also be
due to bind9 and sendmail being bigger than they used to be (it's my
secondary DNS server and my primary relay server).  Not disagreeing with
you or questioning what you're saying at all, just mentioning my success
with 2.4.18 on a 386 DX/40 w/ 8M of ram.
