Yes, but very limited. So far the only thing I've plugged into mine is a CD
writer.  Haven't tried writing yet, though. Reading works, but
enabling DMA for the drive caused a crash. I got the card to see
if it could be a solution to my CD writing problem (details in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101826880719379&w=2) and also
because they go for only 29 euros around here.

It would be nice to know what bugs exist in current CMD chips, namely
649 and 680. David S. Miller seems to know?
