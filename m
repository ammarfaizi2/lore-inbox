I think the anitrust issues are moot -- they have had their way already
with Microsoft.  They've been left beaten and crippled in the eyes of 
the general public.  Large Customers seem to not be swallowing .NET.

Their behavior is inconsistent with the Trial Judge's ruling.  Technically,
by pursuing .NET, they are not observing the spirit of the ruling.  If 
you get a ruling put on you by a court, you are supposed to observe what
it says and correct your behavior, even if the execution order was stayed 
by the court pending appeal.  The Judge did not set aside the ruling --
it's still there.  

Because of this, any investment in Microsoft strategies by large enterprise 
customers are an unknown until the appeals court makes a determination.  
Microsoft is also setting itself up for a contempt order by doing this. 
The trial court told them to stay out of the internet business with their 
operating systems business unit.  Their compliance has been illusionary 
with the court's ruling, and unless the appeals court vacates the ruling, 
they could be in big trouble.  

If I were the DOJ, I would already be putting together an OFC for 
filing with the trial court.  They are also doing the worst possible
thing you can do while a case is on appeal, which is to ignore the 
trial court's rulings, and resorting to character assisination of 
the trial judge.
