I can not apply this patch == I am able to not apply this patch
I cannot apply this patch ==  I am not able to apply this patch

If you are going to correct something be careful of changes
in meaning.

> Russell's patch -> The patch which Russell wrote

Assumes data not in evidence.  Russel might have composited
the patch.  Try "The patch from Russel" or "The patch Russel
provided"  I would honestly be willing to have just "Russels
Patch", "Russel patch" or "patch a la Russel" to evade the
tortured language for avoiding the possesive.

In any case, if it doesn't make the text more clear what is
the point?
