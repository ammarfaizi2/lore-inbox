Thank you.  That's a very kind and generous offer.  You might want to consult a
French attorney, though, just to make certain there's no way they could make
trouble for you under French law.

I really appreciate the fact that you're willing to help, but I wouldn't want
you to risk getting into trouble on our behalf.

Wayne

Ok, so mail me the security-related informations at
kilobug@club-internet.fr, it's in France so you can, and I'll forward them.

I don't plan to go to the US a day or another (I won't go to any country
that use death penalty, for moral and political reasons), and so I don't
fear their DMCA.
