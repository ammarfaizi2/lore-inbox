Release 1.9.15: Thu Dec 27 04:44:31 EST 2001
	* Alternate tree-widget-based X interface by W. Chang 
	  <wchkang@etri.re.kr> introduced.
	* Corrected a CML2 compiler bug in `suppress depends' handling,
	  thanks to Rob Landley.

We have an entire new front end in this release, code based on a tree width
that shows a nice folder view of the configuration menus.  Install and try 
out `make treeconfig' to see it.

Strict gun laws are about as effective as strict drug laws...It pains
me to say this, but the NRA seems to be right: The cities and states
that have the toughest gun laws have the most murder and mayhem.
