Yes, it was changed pretty much.

In theory, you can call dma_mmap_coherent() on each page obtained via
dma_alloc_coherent() in the case of sg-buffer.  It should work without
much overhead on most of archs, but ones like sparc32 may have
problems because each alloc_coherent call results in another
allocation a resource struct (if I understand the code correctly).

So, I rewrote the code to use the normal get_page() + map/sync.
Hopefully this works for archs with non-coherent mm...
