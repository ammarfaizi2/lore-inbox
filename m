	Hello All ,  I am looking for pointers to bsd file system tools
	for use under Linux .  A couple of searchs left me empty .
	I am hoping someone here has a pointer or two .
	What this is for is ,  I have a disk drive off of a bsd4.2 system
	that may have been used in a penetration of another system .
	The fstab file points at there having been a /var file system but
	when I do a 'fdisk -l' a partition for /var does not exist .  Only
	two partitions are there for / & /usr .  I am looking for some
	tools to see if the partiton was removed or if 'parted' may have
	been been used to squeese it out .  Thank you for any pointers .
		JimL
