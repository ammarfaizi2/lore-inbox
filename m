Is it a program, set of documents or what? Is it self-contained
anywhere so I can download that at once?

Coul you please point me to a specification of an object called
"DocBook stylesheets"?

How do I determine what distribution I have? I have compiled my whole system
manually.

Asking again: how do I install "DocBook stylesheets"?

Do you say that the place where DocBook stylesheet sources can be downloaded
depends on distribution I have? I have been looking at their sourceforge
project page but there is nothing like "download DocBook stylesheets".
There are DocBook-dsssl and a ton of other cryptic packages but none of them
is stylesheets.

If there doesn't exist any distribution-idependent installation process
for "DocBook stylesheets", then "DocBook stylesheets" is not portable,
and transitively, "Linux Kernel" is not portable. Could you please
recommend me some other open-source free operating system where I don't
need to have a "distribution" to be even able to read it's enclosed
documentation? I have been using Linux Kernel for 7 years but can't anymore
because I am unable to read it's manual.
