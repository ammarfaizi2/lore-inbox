	Uhh. That's not what I was ranting about. What I was
ranting about is that we have never 'put to paper' the
requirements ('motiviations') for a good VM, nor have we
looked at said nonexistent list and figured out what instrumentation
would be needed.

	I don't now that much about VM, but I do know a bunch of
people each scratching their own itch, and most of them not looking
at the bigger picture. Linus, RvR, etc. excepted. Mostly. ;^)

	The whole 'neural network' bit was mostly troll. Sorry,
I got a little carried away at that point.
