True. That's why I suggested that every developer who want this driver 
removed, also stays true in their dedication for open drivers, delivers 
some *constructive* action and emails Philips or whatever company of the 
day that needs some convincing. Not just shooting down what you don't like 
and being impossibly hard to people like Nemosoft who are caught between 
two fires. If you care about opensource, equally much time would be spent 
in (1) giving a minimal try to get it opensource, and (2) having a 
constructive dialog with the maintainer. It can't take more time than 
having these fights, can it?
