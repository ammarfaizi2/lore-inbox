This is (part of) what I'm doing for my honors project this year - so 
possibly something (might) be around and (almost) working by the end of 
the year. The real big trick is remote efficiency - but what's the fun 
of research if there isn't something tricky?

If people are actually really interested in it, I might make it a bit 
more of a focus :)

More info avail on request :)
