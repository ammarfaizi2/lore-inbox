I was merely requesting a bit more verbose information in your regular
changelog, the whole thing is quite exhaustive but this entry didn't
really fit and contained no useful information at all.

I will definitely consider reading the "full changelog" although I
cannot remember having read anything about such a thing before this
thread.

This is very encouraging information that had been missing from the
threads at all: a success story from a person actually trusting und
using this thing.

I for one did read the discussion(s) but it's really hard to map IDE-101
to some tiny patch in a huge tree of mails.

I appreciate Martins work and even more your word on it that it's pretty
stable.=20

Keep on the good work and let us end this thread for good.
