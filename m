FYI Windows can't stay running long enough to pose much of a
security hazard. A week ago, I dumbed-down one of my boxes at
home, that had been running Linux reliably for over a year. I
wanted to install Cakewalk Home Studio and it hasn't (yet) been
ported to Linux. So far, I have re-installed everything 4 times,
plus the 'mandatory' Windows/2000 patch. It is impossible to
do anything useful for more than an hour without encountering
the Blue-Screen-of-Death, followed by a re-install because the
machine won't complete a boot without another 'blue-screen'.

So, it's true. Linux, which can stay running for 300 or more days,
is a good target for Internet Hackers to poke at -- and we've got
lots of servers on-line just baiting hackers for DOS attacks. Most
Windows machines don't poke their dirty noses out from behind
fire-walls, so they are "more secure".

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (797.90 BogoMips).

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
