I've had a pile of old stuff from 1993->1995 that escaped due to freak
chance and non reuse of an old disk. I've now rescued the data and finally
had time to strip the original Linux lists out of it. I dont have 1991/1992 
alas but hopefully someone else does. Ted used to have them on tsx-11
I believe /

Anyway if you want to know what DaveM's first post looked like, read the
very first Linux code freeze announcement or just wondered what a 5 mail
a day kernel list was like..

Enjoy.
