Sure. I spent much happy time telling people to report bugs to nvidia because
their closed drivers mean that only nvidia can debug all the crashes people see
with them loaded - at least some of which dont occur without the modules

I wouldnt put them on the list though. Nvidia hardware seems to work, and they
are being quite honest and up front with their proprietary drivers being
exactly that
