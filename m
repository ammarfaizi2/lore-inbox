I thought a few people out here might be interested in knowing that
the Linux Graphing Project's code had a new release a couple weeks ago
after being quiet for a few years.  This is the descendent of Paul
'Rusty' Russell's code that produced the 2.4.0 kernel posters a way
back when 2.4.0 was big news.  Over the past few months I've slowly
gotten the old code base updated to work cleanly on 2.6 kernels as
well as being usable on kernels as old as 1.2 :-)  There are a few
general bug fixes as well.

If anyone feels daring enough to try to print a full poster, it needs
to be at least 6ft wide to have a chance at reading the file and
function names. Also a high resolution is required; 600dpi is just
barely usable.
