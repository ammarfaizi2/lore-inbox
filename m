Hi all.

When using radeon DRM module I get these on syslog:

Apr  9 10:14:15 nbsteu kernel: [drm:radeon_cp_init] *ERROR* radeon_cp_init 
called without lock held
Apr  9 10:14:15 nbsteu kernel: [drm:radeon_unlock] *ERROR* Process 1602 using 
kernel context 0

Then the module is regularly shown by lsmod, but DRI in X doesn't work. This 
didn't happen in 2.6.4-mm2: I thought it was a matter of CONFIG_4KSTACKS, but 
in 2.6.5-mc3 it defaults to "no"...

Here attached, lspci and .config.

Bye.
