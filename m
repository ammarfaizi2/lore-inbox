Generally in any modern case the air flow works with the case closed, and
opening the case will not improve things. If you are set up to use the
fans to pull air out and have cold air come in by pressure differential it
*really* won't help. Of course a bad case might work better that way, but
there aren't a lot of them out there any more, sort of went out with the
AT form factor.
