Sigh... Would these broken things, by any chance, be "my grand ideas are
not met with applause"?

Take it from a guy who've done  quite a few global changes: they are pretty
much doable, but spamming maintainers with requests to support your k3wl
ideas is not a way to go. All you are getting that way is a bunch of procmail
rules.

Everyone who had been on l-k for more than a couple of months had seen
$BIGNUM of "visionary" lusers with grand schemes of Changing The World(tm)
and monumental lack of desire to learn. Until you demonstrate that you
understand what you are "fixing" - don't expect special treatment.
