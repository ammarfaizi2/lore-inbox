Things have been moving along at a fast pace over the last couple 
of weeks, with tons of little changes and bugs fixes all over the
place.

Of note, some major IDE cleanups have made their way to Alan Cox's
tree and a 32 bit dev_t patch is in Andrew Morton's tree.

The latest status update is at the usual URL:

As usual, please let me know if anything is missing or incorrect.
Enjoy!
