Hi, Ken!

Too bad that the changelog for -ac6 doesn't mention reiserfs, so I didn't
bother trying it.

Another problem is that the archive at
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/ updates only once a
day. I checked it and decided that my information could still be useful.

I'd be grateful if somebody pointed me to a better archive.
