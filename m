Me too (2700T). I was meaning to look into it when I had time,
but since I never do now is as good a time as any :-)

If noticed the lockups occur when the "battery low"
light starts flashing. I.E. it's realted to some
APM event. Also the mouse is unresponsive for me
when this happens.

I upgraded to BIOS 1.10 2 days ago actually, just
in case this would magically fix things so I'll
keep you posted.

Pádraig.
