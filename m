Well, since BK has made it so trivial for me to merge with Greg, the thing 
is already integrated into my tree, and as a result the patches should 
already have been sent out on the patch lists by the robots, and the 
snapshots will follow shortly as the automation decides to kick in.

In short, give BK the credit it deserves. You get all the information you
want, and the fact that you depend on and force yourself to use inferior
tools is not the fault of BK.

In other words: _despite_ your luddite ways you actually have more
information available to you than you would have had without BK.

So stop whining about BK. Put up or shut up - you get timely non-BK 
snapshots, and the fact that others see the value of their tools in the 
things they do for them shouldn't be an issue for _you_.

Stay in the stone age if you wish, but don't expect your stone-age 
muscle-propellered log car to go as fast as the rocket of the future. And 
don't complain to us who don't want to expend energy on stuff that 
shouldn't need it. We've got better tools.
