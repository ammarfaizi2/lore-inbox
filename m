CA-Staff/Senior Engineer: Linux TCP/IP Stack Development

SecureAll Inc., headquartered in the Silicon Valley, California, is a 
well-funded start-up in the Enterprise Information Security domain. 
It is well recognized that enterprises are on the average 6 months 
behind on applying security patches. During this period, despite 
employing firewalls and intrusion detection systems, enterprises 
are vulnerable to exploits leveraging the un-patched weaknesses. 
It is also acknowledged that patch management is an imperfect science
and does not take away the risk of applying patches without adequate 
testing. SecureAll offers a solution that is truly radical and solves
the above problems in an elegant fashion. The foundation of the company
is based on a patented breakthrough technology that takes network-based
enterprise security to the next level. 

We are currently looking to fill one full-time regular positions in our 
San Jose, CA facility  requiring extensive experience with TCP/IP 
protocol stack development.
