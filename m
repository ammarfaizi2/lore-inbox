P4/HT SMP works fine here - config attached.

since your lockups occur under X, could you try to disable DRI/DRM in
your XConfig? Also, would it be possible to connect that box to another
box via a serial line and enable the kernel's serial console via the
'console=ttyS0,38400 console=tty' boot option and run 'minicom' on that
other box, set the serial line to 38400 baud there too and capture all
kernel messages that occur when the lockups happens? Also enable the NMI
watchdog via nmi_watchdog=1.

	Ingo
