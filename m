I am beta testing the Dockingstation for Creatures, and I got some 
extras for it. But on my SuSE box the thing freezes within minutes, if 
use all the agents. Its a very proccessor and memory intensive app. And 
I have 256MB ram.


Just watched it crash when I started mozilla....

Only just found out people are having issue with RAM and 2.4.5....? I am 
running 2.4.4....

I do not think the program has a bug...But no-one else is even saying 
anything which is very annoying.
