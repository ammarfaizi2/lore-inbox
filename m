I meant in relation to Bit Bucket.

If the need for Bit Keeper to make a profit for Bit Mover excludes
Linux developers from using it, the most logical thing to do in my
opinion is to start from scratch and write a version control system
dedicated to furthering Linux kernel development.

Compatibility with Bit Keeper should not be a goal of that project.
