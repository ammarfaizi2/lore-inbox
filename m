<noflame=1>
I'm looking for some authoritative comparisons and discussions of the
current network stacks in *BSD and Linux.  I.e. NET4 in Linux and
whatever is most current in *BSD.

_PLEASE_ no flaming, no causing flamewar, nadda.

I am writing an article for Linux.com and I am attempting to debunk
longstanding fallacies on both sides of the camp.  I am aiming for a
truely neutral article which means I want to hear about the bad as well
as the good for both camps.

I am no master, and haven't played with *BSD in a few.  I would
appreciate any of you who can cooly speak their mind and provide
insightful information.

I am looking for:
    articles
    benchmarks
    commentary
    references
    etc..

Thank you,
-d
