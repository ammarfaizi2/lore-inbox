Oh, for crying out loud!  You've very eloquently described the problems
with reading code in alien style.  You have said that you were tired
with other folks complaining about coding style of devfs.  I replied
telling these people where to look for a version that will be in
standard kernel style, so that they could get off your back.  What's
your problem with _that_, for fsck sake?
