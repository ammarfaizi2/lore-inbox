Uhmmm. You known, being born in the Soviet Union (not a country in its
strictest sense), doesn't necessarily mean you know its history. And
considering that the span of the SSSR was quite enormous...

Anyhow:

The city was originally called Nyen and was formed by Swedes. 1703,
Peter the Great invaded the city, and 1712 the city became the capital
of Russia, named St. Petersburg. The name remained St. Petersburg until
1914, when it was renamed Petrograd. 1918, Moscow was made the capital
of Russia, and 1924 the city got renamed again, this time to Leningrad.

Well, it's time for me, as a Swede, to begin calling it Nyen?!

Oh, let's end this silly debate. I'm getting sorry I even brought it
up.
