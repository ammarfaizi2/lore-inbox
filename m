Why, it opens up the market for serial-ports-on-USB devices. HW
manufactures can make significantly more money on that than on $7.95
ISA multi I/O cards[1] ;-)

[1] and I still dislike those, because they are only useful with lots

but RS232 ports _are_ necessary in the real world, and more often than
you like you need more than 2 of them.
