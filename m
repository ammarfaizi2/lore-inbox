Yes, precisely what i was talking about. 
Something really simple joe average can
follow. 
It has to be validated from a license point of view, 
but also from a technical side. 
Otherwise, hardware folks license a piece of hardware and 
then change something along the way, which doesn't work with the driver. 
So ideally you have
the according linux kernel hacker acknowledging this as well was 
OSI or someone else.
This would be a fantastic central database to look up for linux hardware
compatibility. 
With clever Marketing, this in itself could be turn up quite some
revenue. 
Part of the money could be returned to kernel bounty payment....
And this would put tremendous pressure on hardware folk to get in there 
- job done.
I think this is feasable and if it chucks out some money, i can be done.

Dirk
