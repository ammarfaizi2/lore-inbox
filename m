Hi all,

appearently there are some secret channels by which one has to post his 
messages for them to actually being _read_ by someone ...

Well, there is this:
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0212.2/0971.html
(Next time I'll cc' you directly :-)

But to answer the original question: _Actively_ being maintained is a 
bit of an euphemism, 'occasionally being patched' is probably more accurate.

Richard Henderson and Ivan Kokshaysky are the main men behind the port.

I try to give the port the occasional bug-fix.

Cheers,

Hannes
