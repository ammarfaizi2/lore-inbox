I think this confirms that the answer is yes.  See the following at  
the above URL:

Since when is the string "!.?|" an operator???  Or "?^", "+|", "~|",  
"?|", etc.  I
think Larry's gone off the deep end on this one.  It may be an  
incredibly powerful
and expressive language, but it seems _really_ strange, and probably  
will produce
the best Obfuscated-code contest the world has ever seen. (Better  
even than the
Perl5 one).
