Yep. Part of what is nice about it, too ;-)

Then get them to agree on a common framework! They are trying hard to get
other parts of the GUI work well together, so this isn't far off in
wishfull thinking land.

Right. So then we have Gnome's way of doing things (Gnome isn't just for
Linux!), KDE's way, XFCE's way, ... (ditto). Plus the kernel way. Flambee
with a monthly thread on all reachable fora about "Why on &%@# does the
%&~#@ GUI not use the *#%&@ kernel's way?!".

This is /not/ the way of fxing that particular problem. Shoving random
stuff into the kernel /can't/ force its use. At least not until Linux is
the only Unixy system around, and that is still some way off. And when that
has happened, the kernel's way must be /clearly/ better for /all/ users, or
it won't matter.
