Unfortunately, my clock is b0rken. This damn little machine just does
not have ability to retain time across reboot. [For booting, I need
winCE. WinCE will crash upon boot if something unexpected (like linux)
is in memory. Therefore I need to remove main battery for reboot :-(.]

It even does not have ability to retain time correctly during powersave
mode, but that could be solved.

Before someone says "NTP", this machine is usually not connected anywhere --
it comunicates via ATA flash. Maybe I could scan  flash for newest timestamp
and use that for date...

Oh, and it might be possible that mail was accidentaly sent twice. Sorry for
confusion.
