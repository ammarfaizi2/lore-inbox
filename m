Dear Sir/Madam,
Due to reasons i would explain in greater detail later,i am in search of a =
sincere partner to assist me in securing and investing the sum of =
USD25,000.000 (twenty five million  dollars)inherited from my father's =
business reserve.
I am the only surviving child of late Mr Sekou Janeh ,a liberian diamond =
merchant.my father became rich from his extensive investment in  diamond =
trade both in Liberia and in Sierra leone.he was assasinated in =
Monrovia,Liberia in November 2000 by gunmen of the Charles Taylor-led =
dictatorship while on a business trip. Before his death, my father who =
foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property based on his line of =
business and the insecurity of the region, decided to deposit the above sum =
with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the =
only inherited property of our family after the death of my father; yet the =
liberia government and it's loyalists are bent on hunting us down because of =
my father's vast financial reserve.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 20% =
of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds or 25% share =
of a possible joint venture business.
if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed =
information. if you do not accept my offer,in good fate treat with utmost =
confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for =
more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
ANDREW JANEH.
