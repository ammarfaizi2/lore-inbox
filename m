Hi Andre,

It was nice that we were finally able to get together. I'm excited that with
your assistance we will be able to offer a good, seemless Linux solution for
our FastTrak customers. We should have all of the documents you need rounded
up here in the next day or so, and we'll get those to you ASAP. We look
forward to working with you.

Regards,

Craig

Greetings Craig et al. (bcc'ed)

After many missed attempts to have this meeting, we finally succeeded in
the long awaited discussion.  I must admit being surprized and now
impressed with Promise's ablity and willingness to accept my defined
terms of IP boundaries.  With these small steps towards understanding IP
limitations, the next few days will prove, success in Linux for
Promise Technologies is a small folder of documents away.  By coming the
table of OPEN Source, you have demonstrated all things are possible and
are leading the way by actions and not just words.

ASL and I offer this informative message to the greater linux community,
and the fine details shall be disclosed in short order or as needed.

Finally, the important issue is Promise has agreed to work with Linux.

Regards,

Andre Hedrick
