What if the employer _is_ interested in contributing to the open source
under company copyright and doesn't mind using company resources, but
the employee prefers to keep copyright to himself.  The only way he can
do it is by using his own resources and time (off hours).  But this is
not possible if there is a contract that coveres the full employment
period, including after hours.

The reason why I wanted to bring up this matter was to figure out the
possibility of doing open source work purely as hobby.  One can't use
his company name for _that_.  When the company name is used, it is no
longer a hobby. ;-)
