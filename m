Hi,


I have an Initio 9100UW SCSI board (INIC-950p chipset) running just fine 
with kernel 2.4.24 (yes, I know it's old).

I want to update my kernel do 2.6.8. The question: is there support for 
this board/chipset under kernel 2.6.x?

I looked around a lot and couldn't find much. www.initio.com says their 
code is in the kernel since 2.0.32. Has it been left out for 2.6.x?

Is anyone working on this port? Anyone intending to work on it?

Please CC: directly to me as I'm not subscribed to this mailing list.


TIA,

Rodrigo Severo
