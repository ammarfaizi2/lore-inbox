Its not "bullshit" as you so "eloquently" put it, Christoph.  As for 
looking it up, I'd imagine your ability to run a search engine at 
fcc.gov exceeds mine.  Hint, its probably in the section called "Rules 
that apply to all". These rules go back to about the time of when they 
outlawed any transmit tunability in CB radios in the later 70's, so its 
not a new item by any means as its just an extension of that edict to 
cover this newer technology. The fact that it effectively put a stop to 
conference call type use of single sideband because no 2 radios were on 
the same, now non-adjustable frequency was an undesirable thing, but 
thats the breaks.  I might try and look it up after I've had some zz's, 
as I just came from doing transmitter maintainance overnight.

I don't think you'll find that to be the case here in the states.
