Yea, yea. The little problem here is that TOG is not getting it.
When I see a website that says "Employees of member companies should
send mail to the Consortium Administrator requesting access to the
Member area.", I sure as hell is not getting a hardon about working
on "overtaking Winsock" (and why exactly would we want to copy
broken attempts to embrace and extend? Perhaps you should talk to
a certain <i>monkey lover company</i> about it).

I would not mind to participate in something more open.
If anyone has a suggestion of a mailing list which works
in a way of tcp-implementors, but on the topic of socket API
extensions for Infiniband, then I am interested.
