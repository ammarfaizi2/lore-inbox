My nominations are as follows:

o Steve Jobs	: we would get linux onto the kweul 
new imacs by default and have a yummy gui system 
along with the benefits of airport.

o Bill Gates	: we would get excellent microsoft 
integration and not have to worry about any of their 
propriety protocols

o Captain Janeway : for she would boldly take linux 
where no-one has taken it before </theme_tune>

B.
