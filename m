This is good news.  I want to add something here that's a little less lame 
than 'me too'...

Besides being an essential development tool I use every day, I believe there 
is great potential for UML as a 'perfect jail'.  There are interesting 
applications we'll start to see when UML is more widely available, such as 
simulation of clusters, or 'Linux Bubbles' under Windows.

I think you've done a great job maintaining UML out-of-tree for more than a 
year, with very little assistance, and I hope you won't have to shoulder that 
extra burden much longer.
