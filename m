A little contribution to the ongoing suspend saga. This is a Sony Vaio
SRX51P Laptop (P3 Mobile CPU, i820 chipset).

echo -n "mem" > /sys/power/state :
~  Shots the laptop nearly instantly into some deep sleep state, from
which it only awakes after power cycling (removing ac and battery).

echo -n "disk" > /sys/power/state :
~  Quite interesting. Laptop seems to suspend correctly, but can
only be awakened by holding the power switch >4 seconds. Then the kernel
finds a valid resume partition and tries to resume, but says:
"Kernel panic: Resume Machine: Unable to find suspended-data signature
(pmdisk-swa - misspelled?"
Swap partition is the one it suspended to... On next reboot it again
tries to resume (though noresume was given at the command line), fails,
reboots and than works again.
Sometimes it also can only be awakened through power cycling.

echo -n "standby" > /sys/power/state :
The display flickers shortly and dmesg logs:

PM: Preparing system for suspend
Stopping tasks: =====================================|
Restarting tasks... done

nothing else happens. Adding a 'sleep 1' doesn't change anything.

sleep 1; echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep :
~  Sort of works, but no sleep in between. From dmesg:

Stopping tasks: ======================================|
Freeing memory: ................|
hda: start_power_step(step: 0)
hda: completing PM request, suspend
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1f.2 to 64
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1f.4 to 64
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1f.5 to 64
hda: Wakeup request inited, waiting for !BSY...
hda: start_power_step(step: 1000)
hda: completing PM request, resume
Restarting tasks... done

sleep 1; echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
~  Freezes the laptop. Like "disk".

Anything else I could try? What makes me wondering is, that the laptop
never really tries to come up from sleep (except "disk").
This is test9, earlier tries on random 2.6-test versions didn't show
anymore success.

Thanks,

Jan
