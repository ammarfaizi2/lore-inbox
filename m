Just patched the kernel and booted it up..To begin with it looked OK and 
there wasn't any swapping.Even firing up VMware didn't cause it to swap..

Then all of a sudden the mouse started moving all over the screen and 
left and right clicking on everything on it's own. ?? Really weird..
Ran like that for 5 minutes then the machine crashed hard.
Now I've booted up with the std 2.4.17 again..

I assigned 192 MB for XP that should be more than enough..And as long as 
Linux doesn't swap it is..
