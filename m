Hi,

I am having problems while booting 2.6.12-rc2-mm1 on i386 with command line maxcpus=1.  Without this commandline, system boots fine otherwise it hangs. 
Serial output is pasted below.

If maxcpus=1 is given along with acpi=off then system boots fine. I am not sure where the problem is.

2.6.12-rc1-mm4 does not have this problem.

Any idea what is going on? config file is attached with the mail.

Thanks
Vivek
