Mr. Schmiedehausen,

I have not insulted you, just stated the facts.
Those are not threats they are terms to enforce the License you agreed
upon the very act of editing the source code that you are using in the
kernel.  It is you that would be violating the rules, and that makes me
"hostile"?  What about the issue you doing the initial terms and actions
to harm me by willfully disregarding the the terms and usage?

Please note that "you" refers to a generalixed individual.
It is not intended to imply, state, charge, or any other means of accusing.

We agree that user-space programs that are value add are binaries.
I also use programs that I have not source code for; however, you are now
parsing the difference between user-space and kernel-space.

I do not have a strong point of view on user-space open-source, however,
if I got the source, hey no big deal.

Well, I would find very few that would not define "me" as part of
"the Linux community".  In fact these that have been charge with the task
or have voluteered to the task of maintaining a supporting a subsystem are
generally viewed as the contact point for that sub-system.

./drivers/net/		Don Becker
./drivers/scsi/		Justin Gibbs
./drivers/char(serial)	Ted Ts'o
./drivers/usb/		The USB gang of Matt, Johannas, etc..
./arch/arm/		Russel King
./arch/ia64/		Walt Drummond
./arch/sparc(64)	David Miller
./arch/ppc		Paul Mac.
./arc/m68k		Geert U.

The point being, there are people designated as point or leaders.
If you have an issue with me, you are free to submit it to Linus, Alan,
or the List.
