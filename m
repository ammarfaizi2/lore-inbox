What is decent today may not be with tommorows' newest softwares....

That is one of the reasons that small businesses are afraid to go to Linux 
now, because of the difficulty in finding skilled Linux sysadmins..

"At least with the 'XX' Os, all they need to do is hire someone that can 
click buttons, either on the computer, or to the tech support line" is the 
perception, and with Linux they are already worried enough that they have to 
find a 'genius' to work on their systems fulltime..

It would be nice if 'advanced administration' can be kept to the minimum, so 
we can service MORE than one enterprise each :>
