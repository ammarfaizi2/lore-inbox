I've updated the status report on the web page at 

http://members.cox.net/tmolina/kernprobs/status.html

- Items marked closed are based on Linux releasing 2.5.28 as well as lkml 
messages.  Those items will be deleted after the next Linus release.

- Links to discussion about the problem reports are available on the page.  
Dates under the discussion column are the date of last modification.  
Those items marked with a kernel version rather than a date are items I 
believe may be specific kernel version.  Those items will be deleted after 
the next Linus release unless further discussion is noted.

- Discussions are only lightly edited to delete headers, trailers, and 
unneeded contextual quotes.  Flamage will not be included.  I will, of 
course, delete any person's contribution at his/her request.

- Comments, criticisms, pointers to relevant material needing to be 
included are gratefully accepted.
