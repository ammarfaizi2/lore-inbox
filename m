True but also due to the fact that many of the people involved do this in 
there spare time versus for a living. 5 hours a week versus 40 makes a big 
difference in how fast something comes to completion.

Unfoturnely the search engines are not that good. Because of the space in

And if they ask do you think they get it? I wonder. OpenOffice does have a

Note free versions. I guess if Sun can afford to lose 2 billions dollars 
it can afford to give a office suite away. The question if Sun runs out of
