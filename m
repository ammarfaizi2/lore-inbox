Hi there,

do you like the technical discussions about OS development on
linux-kernel? 

But you also like to discuss, how other operating systems do it?

Or you like to share some research results about a new approach
in memory management or overall OS architecture (like
exokernels)?

Then join os-devel by sending mail to majordomo@tu-chemnitz.de
containing the single line

subscribe os-devel

in the BODY of the message.

List language is English, the rest will be explained after
subscribing. It is also a closed list (to prevent spamming).

See you there!

Regards

Ingo Oeser
