Thank you for your thoughtful commments.  I'd recommend you send such
comments directly to the author that offends you as posting to the
wide list in a vain attempt to gain yourself some status points is
only going to result in some comment that further offends you and
locks you into a flame war that will certainly consume more of your
time than simple contributing to the KernelWiki project.  Of course,
some people are not concerned about spending their time
constructively.

Ooops, did I post that publically?  Well, it can always serve as a
bad example ;)
