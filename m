Thanks for the info.  Unfortunately, I've already read that document as 
well.  They simply state that support is *supposed* to be in the latest 
kernel.  That's the type of info I'm getting through google; that someone 
(somewhere) has heard that the latest kernel is *supposed* to do it.  I 
was looking for a little more concrete information :)

I was hoping that in posting on lkml that the authors (Jens, Peter, ??) 
would post directly on the status.  HINT-HINT ...

Thanks,
Steve
