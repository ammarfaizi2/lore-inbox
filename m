This is utterly laughable.  It is clearly *not* a virus, or a
plausible vector for one[0], so folks who object to having such a
header in their incoming mail should configure their mail systems to
simply delete the header.  But if you want to wall yourself off from
the rest of the Internet by means of ridiculous measures such as this,
be my guest.
