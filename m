Hi!

   Could you merge the latest stuff in the fbdev BK tree. It has various
fixes and ports over ot the new api. Also a few new drivers. 

http://fbdev.bkbits.net:8080/fbdev-2.5

or a traditional diff at 

http://www.transvirtual.com/~jsimmons/fbdev.diff


P.S
  To the general list. The company I work for appears to be going under.
So if anyone is looking for a kernel developer drop me a email.
