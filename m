Are you sure it is related to SMP and not the fact the Palomino core is
faster in general?

I'm not saying non-Palomino-core Athlons don't have SMP issues.  I'm
sure something is different -- a lot of errata is fixed (and added) in
between core revisions.  I'm just not so sure a measurable difference is
easily shown...especially when there are other reasons for a performance
increase in the core itself.

Anyhow, I don't want to OT...
