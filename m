Hi, 

In first thread of this issue in LKML, some months ago, (right now, I
don't have the link). 
After some discussion, someone arrive the conclusion of that: 
You only need this quirks, if interrupts are in XT-PIC mode and is
harmless if don't (and "should only run for VIA southbridges"). So if
you are in XT-PIC mode, it is more probability that patch -R in
question, have some affect.
cat /proc/interrupts 
give you: IO-APIC-... or XT-PIC ?

and what PCI_IDs do you have ? (lspci -n)

Other issue, you can't revert this patch cleanly because after that we
have other patch that adds some more IDs. So just delete any declare of
PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_82C... and add one declare with PCI_ANY_ID

Thanks,
SÃ©rgio M. B.
