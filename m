Sorry.  I have been away from the internet (somewhat unexpectedly) the
past three weeks... so I am not up to date on what has been happening. 
For the near future as I try and come back up to speed, patches can be
applied from Pavel.

Pavel, perhaps you could send me an email about what you (and others) have
done the past few weeks?  The patches on my site and such are probably a
ways out of date.  What/where is the latest code located?   What progress
has been made...  Hopefully sometime next week I can start working on this
stuff again.

Thanks,
John
