I'd like to ask about http://www.jungo.com/linux.html. Do you consider 
this tool  "acceptable"? Do you think it is worth mentioning to 
companies releasing new hardware if they don't want to make their 
drivers not only open-source, but simply available (as long as Linux is 
concerned)?

Please cc: me as I'm not subscribed.

Thank you for your time
