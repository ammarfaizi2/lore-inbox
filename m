The Nigerian stuff is a scam to take your money from the bank account you
give them and for them to steal your identity.  NEVER EVER give someone your
personal information over the internet or phone.

I want to suggest to the listserver admin (again) that this list and others
on vger.kernel.org be restricted so that you can only post to the list if
you are a member.  Anyone can read it, but you have to sign up to post to
the list.  At least then, the spammers/scammers have to go thru an extra
step that can have their mail server blocked from posting on this list.  I'm
getting damn tired of getting 50-75 spams per day in my inbox and I don't
even use my email address on websites to post.
