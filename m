I don't have access to the beta, but maybe someone else does and would 
enjoy doing it.

The reviews seem to imply that they are building versioning into the FS, 
or at least that you can browse version history as though files were 
directories.  Sounds like they are doing something right.  I would love 
to see the patches written to do that for Reiser4.

SQL still sucks though.;-)
