You are still making the fundamentally flawed assumption that there
_has_ to be a business model in it by which you or I can make money. 

People are observing the way the world seems to be going; you seem to
simply repeat ad infinitum "That can't be true because that way I can't
see how to make money out of it".

You had a brief moment of coherency when you asserted that the
prevalence of Free Software would see innovation grind to a halt since
there would be insufficient motivation to fund large-scale projects, and
hence proprietary software would prevail. I didn't _believe_ you when
you said that, but at least I could understand what you were trying to
say.
