How is the "community" meant to prove that a binary only driver is an
infringing derivative of GPL'ed code? I suppose you could generate
"signatures" for the inlines to compare against the binary, however it
seems a little inequitable. I would suggest if your working with GPL
code in making a binary-only product you should have done your homework
and be prepared to argue why its not derived when asked.

And I say that having written binary only drivers ;-)
