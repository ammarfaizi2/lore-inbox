NO it is not.

Copyright assignment to Linus should be enforced with a specific
condition.  Should Linus ever remove the GPL license, all Copyrights
revert back to the original owners.  This is a forced stale-mate.

All this allows for Linus to set usage policy under GPL conditions.
Outside of GPL, Copyright law is default rules as they are today.

This will kill the wars of the copyright holders v/s the users v/s the
vendors blah blah ...

This also give Linux (the kernel) a single point of authority.

The other thing to do is for every one of the copyright holders convert to
LGPL and so on .... right, lol, go smoke more crack, blah blah blah.

Comments nah, actions yes ...
