You have lots of choices. You're simply opting to take the quick and easy way
out. Your complaint about workstations is unjustified, if you insist on buying
pre-built workstations, there are many companies that you can buy linux
workstations from (strange, I thought VA did something like that for awhile
until they backed out of the hardware business, guess I was mistaken though,
as there aren't any options).

As for modems, this isn't anything but an excuse either. Broadband is very much
commonplace these days.. being force into dialup is less and less of a problem
these days. However, paying 70$ for a peice of trash hardware modem is no one's
fault but your own, and your inability to look around.

On top of that, your entire argument is broken. If you fry your machine, you
have a pretty good chance of being able to just repair it instead of having to
replace it with an entire new machine. Or if you can't, there's always the ever
so difficult scenario of removing the damned modem from the machine and moving
it over to a different one (provided you had a software modem in the alleged
new one).

In that case, you've made your choice, which is to work for a MS using company.
No one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to use MS products, you do
so of your own free will. Coming up with excuses to try and justify using
something you allege to hate so much is just pathetic.

Also, say for some reason you are "forced" into working temporarily for such
a company to pay the bills.. nothing is stopping you from looking for alternate
means of employment.

Seems to me you just want the quick and easy way out, and refuse to admit the
possibility that there are other options. Just because you haven't taken the
time to look at them, doesn't mean they don't exist.
