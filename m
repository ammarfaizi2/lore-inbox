I'm not certain if this is the right place, but are there plans to
have big file support (files >2GB) anytime soon?  I ask, as we use
Linux to serve LOTS of streaming media and the logs for popular sites
often exceed 2GB.  I'd like to see the ability to handle at least 16GB
files, possibly more.

Please cc: me on any replies if possible.  I've been REALLY busy and
am finding it hard to keep up with l-k traffic.

Thanks!
