It'd be even better if you could change the business model so that you
made MORE money without having to even go through the effort of making
software, or even doing much of anything at all.  But (as you may
recall) that business model imploded rather dramatically last year or
so...

Anyone who opens a statement with "wouldn't it be a better world..." has
usually just found another variant on "..if wishing really hard for
something made it come true?"  This is no different.

Yep.  Because you have wishes and horses confused.  (Or, possibly, were
hit on the head recently.)  Want to get them detangled?  Explain how he
can recoup his millions of dollars worth of game development by giving
it away; don't just say "it'd be swell if you did, and the world would
be better, honest" but say HOW.  As in "it'd be swell if you did, and
you can feed your family by <stealing/working in fast food/selling
someone else's game instead/....>"

Um.  Heh.  I'm gonna leave this to stand, there's very little I can add
that wouldn't reduce its humour.
