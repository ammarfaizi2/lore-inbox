So, 23:59 is getting closer some countries around the world, i dont 
think changing
the leader attacks the right problem. What's needed is to change to the 
project
model, course there to many hackers that produces to much code, we need 
more administrative
people for organisation purposes,  and using a project model like 
"PROPS" would
be perfect for future Linux kernel development.

if it's not to late, then i'll nominate Bill Gates as future kernel 
development leader.

PS. you dont know what PROPS is? just never take a job where they stands 
for PROPS if you
      think you are a hacker.
