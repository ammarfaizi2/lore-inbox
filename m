Ingo did not help me developing X15.

The only point of the exercise was to verify that one can actually build a web
server that is as fast (or faster) than TUX running in user space.

Ingo (and a few others) were convinced that it was impossible and challenged me
to prove my assertions.

Moreover Ingo knew very well that our product is commercial. Indeed at the time
we hadn't even yet decided to release the sources.
