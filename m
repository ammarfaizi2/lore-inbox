Hotmail actually, as whole M$, is unreachable, so no1 could tell it `em.

Correct - and additionally: what's about Win 95-ME, NT, W2K; *BSD?
When I'm end user they don't block an ECN connection I thought, or do they?
Idea: some1 makes up a web server.
 - If I can connect ECN is working
 - On the site I can enter my mail addy and get a mail there. If it arrives, everything is ok.
