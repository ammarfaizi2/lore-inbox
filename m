I banned you from the site entirely because your email
address keeps bouncing from time to time, repeatedly,
and instead of contacting us and asking why you just
blindly resubscribe.

I figured that blocking you entirely would get your
attention and finally make you try to contact us.

The most recent reason I had to delete you from the
list was:

1163127092 davem marc@perkel.com linux-kernel Has bogus block on horms@verge.net.au

Every posting made by Simon gets blocked by your site.

Previously the reason was:

1155683148 davem perkel.com linux-kernel blocks the string 'patches', what a joke

And before that I was seeing:

1136501663 davem marc@perkel.com linux-kernel 421 Lost incoming connection: The error was detected in line 3.

You really need to fixup your email setup before I will allow
you to resubscribe.
