A stupid measure, since you cannot determine what was rejected, i.e. how
many babies you threw out with the bathwater.

Some ISPs rely on crap software & OS to process email, and have other
bad habits besides.  Censorship usually does more bad than good
(especially since dealing with 80% of the spam is trivial for
procmail), as has been pointed out in this case.  The stupidity of the
this approach is well shown by the email-blacklist groups blacklisting
each other, I would think that lkml had more brains.

Controlling email is a power game, where you set yourself up as a tin
god and proclaim that you alone know what is safe for the "dumb"
masses to read.  Perhaps the lkml sheep will abide by such control, but
I would think that 'free software' would have 'free discussions'.
