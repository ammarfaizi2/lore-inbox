Thousands of them. Some of them like the Siemens power management patent
really hurt Linux too.

It means you have to file the patent first, which is a pain. The whole 
Software patent thing is a huge disaster and one they are lobbying very
hard to push into europe and via the backdoors of unaccountable
undemocratic bodies like the WTO. They have to, otherwise the demise of
the USA as a viable economy rapidly accelerates because its only the US
afflicted by this mess.

Those defensive patents also provide scope for trading stuff with other
companies, and finally never forget that if you own patents and say its
a stupid idea you carry a *lot* more weight.

I'd suggest Andrea does something else. Ask the Red Hat people for a formal
confirmation he can use it, just like IBM with RCU. I have this funny feeling
that he'll get an extremely positive response.
