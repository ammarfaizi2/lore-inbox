Roberto's statement is about *use*, not *distribution*, so it is
orthogonal to the GPL.

It *does*, however, violate the DFSG, at least in spirit (since it is
only a suggestion).  For what it's worth, the DFSG is my standard for
whether a particular project is worth my time to contribute code to.

Also, Roberto -- it is rather presumptuous to assume that all of your
(potentially) thousands of contributors from around the world happen to
agree about that "fraternity of mankind" or whatever that was.  Call me
a misanthrope, but I'm not sure *I* agree with that one.
