Dear all,
My machine is i686 with 128 RAM, 1GHz processor, and the motherboard
supports ACPI.

When I press the power button the computer goes in sleep mode.

I compiled the kernel 2.4.17 with ACPI support but when I press the
power button to make the computer go in sleep mode it doesn't do
anything, why?

thank you for your help.

Yours,
Ibrahim El-Shafei
