That's the funny thing about this lockup... I can't even get a traceback from 
the serial console.  Here is my boot command line:

auto BOOT_IMAGE=2.4.26 ro root=301 noapic console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 
panic=60 nmi_watchdog=1

I have the watchdog turned on (built in to the kernel, not a module), and have 
been using the above command line, but still get no oops and cannot get a 
traceback...
