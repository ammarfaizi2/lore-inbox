Nothing in life is guaranteed.  But at the very least, I think it would 
be a good step towards improving the Linux end user experience.  Instead 
of the unclear mess we have now (Is it supported?  Check with your 
vendor!), we would be able to say "Look for the Linux Certified logo".  
Combine that with a standard format for source code driver disks, and 
it would be a good step in the right direction.

Maybe our lower cost will make it easier to entice hardware vendors.  As 
far as I know, the requirements for Windows driver certification are 
pretty heft as vendors have to pay for the cost of future driver 
maintenence.  In the Linux case we'll make it easier on the vendors as 
our maintenence component comes from having the source code and many 
hands amongst the community.
