Well, failure to implement proper suspend and resume by a driver does not
stop the entire suspend/resume process, does it? Even if it results
in a blank screen. It doesn't because we have a userspace options and
tools that complements the kernel side. So why should it be any different
in this case? 

Some drivers, i810fb and rivafb, saves the hardware state on the
first open, and restores the hardware state on the last close. This
is usually sufficient for them to restore the hardware to VGA text
mode on unload. It would be nice if we can implement something like this
for all drivers, but failure to do so should not be a reason to stop the
entire process.

If X is using fbdev, then X is also holding a reference count on the
driver.  And the driver will not unload even if you try to.
