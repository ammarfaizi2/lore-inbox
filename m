Yes. We need our hardware enabled for image write (disk would be
enough), so we resume it (and we resume all of it, because that was
easier to code).

No. That's just the way it is. See

        /* Restore control flow magically appears here */

and 

        /* Code below is only ever reached in case of failure. Otherwise
         * execution continues at place where swsusp_arch_suspend was called
         */
        BUG_ON(!error);

Yes, I agree it is confusing, and feel free to suggest comment cleanups.

I'd suggest you hook at disk.c:pm_suspend_disk.

Or just include that /sys interface, and trigger it from userspace
just after resume. Actually I like that best. It is optional, it can
be triggered from userspace, and you will not have to deal with
suspend internals.

(And it will be useful to uswsusp, too, that avoids big chunks of
in-kernel suspend code).
