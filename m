I did _not_ suggest that we discourage HP from giving more hardware if
they wish to. And I didn't mean to show any lack of consideration for
HP's repeated donations to kernel.org in the past; sorry if it sounded
that way. I am really happy, as I think everyone else here is, that HP
supported kernel.org the way they did so far. That's not the point!

I am simply wondering what's the benefit of kernel.org sticking to a
single donator for their hardware, and quite frankly, I couldn't find a
reasonable answer. We should be happy if kernel.org can get more
hardware to solve the current bottlenecks. HP should be happy if they
don't have to pay for all the kernel.org hardware. Other companies may
be happy to help if their developers are affected by the performance
issues that we are experiencing at the moment.

Now, maybe no other company is actually interested in giving hardware
to run kernel.org, or what they are ready to offer doesn't fit the
needs, or maybe there are technical or administrative constraints that
only HP is currently able to fulfill. Again that's not the point. All I
say is that we shouldn't, IMVHO, set as a principle that only one
vendor should be allowed to provide the hardware that runs kernel.org.
It simply doesn't fit in the spirit of the software we are developing.

Just to make it very clear: I am not suggesting that we should start a
competition between various hardware vendors. It's cooperation I'm
thinking about. Again, because that's exactly what free software is all
about.
