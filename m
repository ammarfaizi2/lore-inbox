isn't there an advocacy newsgroup for gnu software?  this is pretty clearly
off-topic.  speaking from my own experience, it's very easy to get caught up
in an advocacy thread, even when that thread is clearly off-topic.  :) i
also suspect that it will continue to generate flames as long as the
originator keeps pursuing it here. ;)
