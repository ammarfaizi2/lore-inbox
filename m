You should have attended Harald Welte's "Enforcing the GPL" talk at
the Linux Kongress this year.  There are plenty of worked examples
where Harald and the Netfilter kernel developers have successfully
taken commercial vendors to court and got them to either (a) release
their enhancements under the GPL, or (b) stop distributing the GPL'ed
code.  It can and has been done in the real world, with multiple
vendors, and they haven't lost a case yet.
