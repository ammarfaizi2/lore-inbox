Quite true.  This isn't about religion.  It's about people's right to 
choose how they license their the code they write.

This is about copyright law and our right to choose what others we can 
do with what we have copyrighted.

While I agree that there is a political agenda behind the GPL, we have 
to respect the rights of those who choose to apply it as a license to 
their creative works.

And furthermore, having a political agenda is not inherently wrong.
