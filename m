I can tell you right now that I am one of these.  I usually would have
been involved in testing it for my situations/needs several months ago,
but I have been very leary of the IDE and block changes.  I have one
machine (a router) that I could test it on if I knew that the dangers of
IDE and block were at least low and that the IPv4 and associated
networking connection tracking and NAT stuff worked.
