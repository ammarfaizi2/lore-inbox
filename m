Subject: [PATCH] SB16 sound breakage: user mode DoS, 2.4.18

Hi all,

when I ran a program on Wine, suddenly my 2.4.18 froze completely.
This has been caused by the program submitting an odd number of output
bytes to the soundcard in 16bit output mode, thus causing the sound
driver to loop endlessly on the last remaining byte.
When digging deeper, I found that this odd number of output bytes had
been caused by the SoundBlaster 16 driver always returning one half of
the output bytes that it could take (in the SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE ioctl
result), thus always cutting the remaining free buffer in half, thus
hitting an odd number after some time (1988 bytes -> 994 -> 497).
The SB16 driver is doing an internal 16bit -> 8bit conversion in case
it's running in fullduplex mode, and it simply returned the remaining
free bytes in the DMA buffer, which should have been twice that number
due to the 16bit -> 8bit conversion in fullduplex mode.
Also, it's doing 8bit -> 16bit conversion in the 8bit output case,
which SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE ioctl didn't account for either.

In short: When using SB16 in fullduplex mode, the SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE
ioctl didn't account for the 16/8bit format conversions that the SB16
does in this case, thus leading to an odd-numbered input count freezing
the box due to a second "odd remainder" endless loop bug.

Thus this patch does:
- add two flags DMA_CONV_16_8, DMA_CONV_8_16 to struct dma_buffparms
  to check for format conversion in dma_ioctl()/SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE
  and thus fix SNDCTL_DSP_GETOSPACE result to account for format
  conversion
- prevent endless looping (lockup) on single remaining byte by
  discarding odd remainders of odd output counts in case of 16bit format

I know of 3 people in total so far that had this SB16 fullduplex problem, BTW
(on a rather limited area as the #WineHQ IRC channel, and within three
weeks of meeting people), and this patch fixed it.
Given the number of people involved and a complete lockup resulting
from these driver bugs (caused by any user having access to the sound device),
I'd think that this problem deserves more attention than it got in the past
(only 1 guy replied to my LKML postings).

I'm not in the least experienced with sound card programming,
so please review and let me know the result, if possible.

CC'd to Alan, the sound maintainer (2.2.x only, though ?)
and Marcelo Tosatti, 2.4.x maintainer.

Thanks !
