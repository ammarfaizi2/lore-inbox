Well, ususpend needs some core functionality to be provided by the kernel,
like freezing/thawing processes (this is also used by the STR), snapshotting
the system memory.  These should be shared with the in-kernel suspend,
be it swsusp or suspend2.

IMHO it's close enough to this, but reiser4 is considered as just another
filesystem and there are many of thses in the kernel already.  Still there
are some controversies around reiser4 as well.
