LPP is themeable, you need to change three header files (one containing the 
picture as an array definition) and then recompile to change a theme. The 
default theme could just use the usual, small penguin as picture, I don't 
think that this will cause a flamewar. If you want another theme it's quite 
easy to create one, you can also download a few themes at 
lpp-themes.sourceforge.net.
