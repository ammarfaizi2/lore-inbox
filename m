Yes. Maybe I must be patient.

But there has not been a 2.5 kernel the past two months
that worked for me, that booted, stayed up for 24 hours
and did not corrupt filesystems.

I am not interested in going out and searching for patches,
unless you specifically come and say: "I fixed HPT366 access -
both PIO and DMA - the driver again does precisely what 2.4 did -
please try".

Hope to try some other vanilla kernel later.
