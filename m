This means if you try to enforce royalties on a patent in a piece of
GPLv2 software, you and everyone else lose the right to distribute it.
However, to enforce or license royalty free is an existing choice.  The
damage caused by making the programme undistributable is assessable
against the value of the patent.

v3 removes this choice by making the patent automatically licensed as
soon as you distribute, hence the choice is taken away.
