It look like good plan, and my question is not answered. Are distro makers  
safe in these time line? What if Red Hat goes bankrupt before the SCO 
falldown.

I believe without them we are lost very valuable assets. Losing Red Hat or 
SuSe are unacceptable. Because of the whole thing slowes down the sales of 
RHAS class expensive Linux contracts may lead economically trouble our very 
importand distros. 

Of course I can live without them, when everything goes bad, I can do linux 
from strach. But what about Joe Sixpack or, Johny WannebeLinux Admin. I think 
none of us want to return status of 1997.

I don't mean technological status of 1997, I mean industry acceptance. Last 
six monts I see lots of system sales & IT consultant people gonna buy 
expensive Linux contracs.

Before the expensive Linux offerings these guys have serious trouble to 
understand Linux nature. Now they are very happy to buy RHAS for 2499$

And now SCO looks like gonna destroy our industry acceptance.

Today I see gartner suggestions about status.

(of course this is M$ biased FUD. But to many people listen them. Remember PR 
;) )

Its look like our distros gonna hurt badly.

Oh.. I think my broken English leads some misunderstanding. I mean, non 
technical (or don't know too much about GNU/Linux communty or even /.) Linux 
users are believe these rumors. They just sing-up some local IT sites, also 
these sites have very limited knowladge about situation. And thoose (I 
believe some M$ biased aproachs) speculations make them nervous.
They have no clue about status, they have not real information sources and 
they are chooses which operating systems run their cooperation or they give 

Personally I'm living in Turkey, we are very very far away that questions, 
problems etc. I have no fears about SCO,his case and others. Neither SCO nor 
M$ can distrub me.

Anyway this is Kernel list, a harcore technical list. That much politics may 
distrub you or others.

But I'm fear about thoose distros, loosing them not good and I believe if this 
mess not finish in A.S.A.P we gonna loose them.

And this is what M$, Sun wants.

Sancar "Delifisek" Saran
