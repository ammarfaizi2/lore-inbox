I've released the 058 version of udev.  It can be found at:
  	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-058.tar.gz

udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ

For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs

And there is a general udev web page at:
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev.html

Note, if you are running a kernel newer than 2.6.12-rc4 (including the
-mm releases) and you have any custom udev rules, you MUST upgrade to
the latest version to allow udev to work properly.  This change happened
because of a previously-unrealized reliance in libsysfs on the presence
of a useless sysfs file that has recently been removed.  Hopefully the
libsysfs people will be releasing a new version shortly with this change
in it for those packages who rely on it.

Also, the rules file structure and use is changing again, in more
powerful ways.  For more details on this, and if you currently rely on
the /etc/dev.d/ feature, please read the RELEASE-NOTES file in the main
udev directory.  A online version can be found here:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/hotplug/udev.git;a=blob;h=9b7fa3133013c4dfc1bc5d759cd198e8aafdef83;hb=5e65ab9a191268fec7cddf6b7d8c0fefd2a6b920;f=RELEASE-NOTES

Thanks go do Dan Stekloff for the libsysfs patch, and for Kay Sievers
figuring out what the problem was.  Also a big thanks to Kay for all of
the recent changes to the rules file logic.  A full list of everyone,
and their changes is below.

udev has also switched over to using git.  The main udev git repo can be
found at:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/hotplug/udev.git
and can be browsed online at:
	http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/hotplug/udev.git

thanks,
