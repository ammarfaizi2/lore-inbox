Hi Richard.

You're ready for a small flame-war with Larry? 8-)

First I think, this list isn't the correct place for starting
a bk-flame again.
But I also share your opinion, that it's time to write even a
free client.
But how hard will it be? How big is the knowlege of the
protocols bk uses? It'll be not easy, but for sure very interesting.
