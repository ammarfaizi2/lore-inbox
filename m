Fuzzy (but realistic) logic:

   kernel != operating_system

   operating_system > kernel

   operating_system - kernel = 0

   kernel - (operating_system - kernel) < 0


The Q. I'd like to know the answer to is:
    What part of the (operating_system - kernel) part is ready to adopt
    v.3?

Another (license compatibility) Q. is:
    If the (operating_system - kernel) is re-licensed under v.3 and
    the kernel is still under v.2 , would it be possible to distribute
    combination (kernel + (operating_system - kernel)) ?

The last Q. is how good is the almost forgotten Hurd kernel?
