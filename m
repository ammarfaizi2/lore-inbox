Your are probably right. 

1)Lets say there is a small licence fee. 
50% to the developer that writes/intergrates the code into the kernel, 
50% to the Org that provides the database/legal backup...

or to get things going
2)no fees, just providing a certain level of docs
such that a driver with full hardware support can be created.
This enables the company to add the "Linux" sticker to their boxes.
