Intel has got the obligation to make sure they are not letting you use
not allowed channels. If you as a manufacturer allow with a certain
change to let people use the channels they want, you are actually
encouraging people to use those channels. Letting the option available
makes Intel liable to get sued. If you buy an US PC, you stick to the US
channels. If you are a world traveler, buy the PC in japan or in Europe.
Then, you will be able to use the US and ROW(Rest of World) channels.

This is just the way it works, else you are liable. Believe me, and not
only me. Intel does not do things to give you a hard time, it is because
of a reason and they have the best lawyers at it.

It is just the Law and the FCC's.
