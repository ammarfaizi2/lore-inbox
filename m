I know. You tell us this again and again. Please stop patronizing.

It might be enlightening to you that a closed users group of SUN coders
is not compareable to a worldwide distributed environment of thousands
of people and companies.

You tell me, that SUN treated _CUSTOMERS_ and companies that wanted to
support SunOS 4.1.x like that? If yes, then I definitely know why they
went SysV. Surely noone wanted BSD any longer.

I would consider the internal development groups in SUN that treated
each other like this also "in need of a change". :-)
