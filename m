Ouch! In what way do you feel a proper "signed off by" contravenes the 
Data Protection Act, the gist of which is that personal information may 
be used only with permission and for the purpose for which it was given. 
I would have thought that signing off the patch meets both those 
criteria. Why do you think it doesn't?
