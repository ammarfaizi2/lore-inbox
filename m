Instruct tech support to
tell the user to not waste his (or the companys) time staring at 
the booting pc. He should do something useful like reading snail mail or
cleaning up his desk.  The login window appear soon enough and then
the user forgets about that strange text.  The only time you
get a worried user reading the text is when the machine
actually hang and leave the text long enough for him to read.
And then the messages _will_ be useful for support.

_Scared_ by _text_?  Sure.  The first time.  And perhaps the
next time. And then it is just one of lifes little oddities,
"the pc pukes some boring text while starting up, nothing
exciting about that, I can login and start working faster than the 
other guys anyway."

Some of them were RED! I'm scared!...
