In Japan they actually have children programs on TV where they speak
(American) English and explain English words to Japanese
children. They also sing English songs. I think that is a good idea
especially considering the difficulties that Japanese have with
English as compared to Europeans whose languages mostly have the same origin. 
If we had such programs in Germany it would probably improve the
overall knowledge of English and the reporters on TV would finally be
able to pronounce Tomb Raider :).
The younger you are the better you are able to learn (not only a
language), so you should start early and if you have fun while
learning that is even better.
