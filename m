So will I, but this message says it better than one of my rants would.
So I'll just second it and add:

Get used to it David, you are NOT going to change it with anything 
resembling your current arguments, which IMO do nothing but waste

winderz project and leave us the hell alone.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word

stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
