Are you sure it isn't a RAM problem or something like that? While
probably all chipsets on the market are buggy, I don't see any hangs
with Linux (with VIA or non-VIA chipsets). I'm using VIA MVP3 with
AMD K6, VIA 686B with dual PIII, VIA KT266A and KT333 with Athlons XP.
The video cards are various older S3, NVidia GFIIs with XFree86 driver,
ATI Radeon 8500.

It might be a problem with the video card as well, are you using NVidia
drivers by chance?
