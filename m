The release kernels aren't supposed to have an autoconf.h - they're
generated by the make config / make menuconfig / make xconfig stage.

You can always verify the integrity of your downloaded package - see
http://www.kernel.org/signature.html for instructions on this.  This
will show if any tampering has occured, but I doubt it.
