from http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/

"DriverLoader technology is the ideal Linux solution to support devices for
 which no adequate native open-source drivers are available. It also allows
 vendors to drastically reduce time to market or eliminate the need to support
 multiple drivers for Windows and Linux. By using the same driver on both
 platforms, significant resources can be saved."
