Yes, the problem afaict is the "works with Linux(notm)" crowd,
e.g., those companies who see ndiswrapper as a way to say
"works with Linux."  I don't see how the Runs with Linux(tm)
org can keep them from saying "works with Linux" and confusing
uses with that, but IANAL.  Maybe "Linux native support" or
some such words could be used to mean your "open source,
supportable drivers."
