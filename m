OK, I remembered where I read it.  A book by Glyn Moody - 'Rebel Code' 
published 2001 ISBN 0-7382-0333-5.

'Linus says of a member of the Helsinki University staff called Ari Lemmke. 
"[Lemmke] had this small area on ftp.funet.fi" - an Internet server at the 
university where files were stored for visitors to donwload uisng the 
standard File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
"It was called nic.funet.fi at that point, and he said that 'hey, I'm putting 
a directory aside for you.'  So he created the /pub/os/linux diectory,"...

"Linux was my working name," Linus continues...

Buggix was also considered... heh.

So, only one man can tell us :-)
