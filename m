Hi all,

Just a thought. Don't shoot the messenger/idiot that thought of it.

I'm getting rather annoyed with the same problem being reported/asked about 
over and over again...

Is there - or would it be nice it it would be here - a list of recent 
compilation problems encountered with stock kernels (and what to do about 
it)? (see the loop.c thingy recently, and other problems with other stock 
kernels). So we could just point the people to that thing instead of having 
these 'discussions' over and over again...

It could be about only the 'full' versions, or maybe the 'pre' kernels too...

Maybe it would even be possible to add keywords to the filtering procs of 
the lkml, so that those persons would get a sort of -automatic- email on 
the subject...

Just a thought...

DK
