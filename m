Hi,

With Con Kolivas' cpu patch I got many slow downs. When I try to run 
CodeWeaver's CrossOver office box gets unresponsive at least for a one 
minute. While starting KDE ( when splash screen is running ) mouse gets too 
sluggish. 

I tried Con's patch with 2.5.73-mm3 too and had same overall bad affects. 
2.5.73-mm3 works very good.

Anyone has an idea whats might be wrong?

Regards,
/ismail
