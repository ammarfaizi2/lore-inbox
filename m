What you are speaking is something I often hear described as "cold, hard 
reality".

I'm just hoping the fact that Tech Source has always been a niche player 
will allow this product to be viable.  There are all sorts of things 
that we can do which would be a waste of time for bigger companies that 
already sell to bigger markets.

I'm hoping that some of this famous "free software loyalty" is really 
true.  One fact is that we really cannot sell this product without 
everyone knowing the cost of every part that went into it.  Even if we 
don't publish all the economic details, fans are likely to figure it 
out.  We really CAN'T screw anyone either on price or on support.  Maybe 
that will count for something.
