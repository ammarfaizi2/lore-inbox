Hi list.

2.6.17-rc2 (and 3 and 4) make my audio skip. Audio player is ogg123 
running in an xterm. Browsing heavy sites (say, eBay) with Firefox 
1.5.0.3 gets me audio underruns quickly. This does not happen on 
2.6.17-rc1 and earlier (I just tested extensively; quite impossible to 
generate underruns on -rc1, quickly on -rc2 and later).

It's not ALSA; reverted */sound/* from the rc1-rc2 interdiff. It's also 
not cfq-iosched.c. Any likely culprits in there? (I'm not a GIT user).

Machine is Duron 1300/786M, idle other than Firefox and ogg123. I have 
attached dmesg and config for 2.6.17-rc2.

Rene.
