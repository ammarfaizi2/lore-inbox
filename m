Much of the commonality is probably no more a copy than
having "her bosom heaved with anticipation" in a romance
novel.

As for Linux code in UnixWare, I seriously doubt there is
that much code in UnixWare that was introduced by
SCO/Caldera or Novell.  Almost all of it came to them via
USL as part of SVR4.

Actually, my guess is that any extensive code similarity is
likely to be code incorporated into SVR4 from BSD or other
sources and not SCO property.  The parade of copyright
notices on SVR4 boot is a long one.
