In the demo I saw, they had about 6 sample surfaces ranging from
a mirror to blue jeans. I also got to play with the mouse on the demo
system and it worked very well. At the time, mice were about $25 to $35
dollars, and theirs were like $79 or $99. I remember thinking it was a
cool toy, but the price difference was going to keep it from mass market
potential.
