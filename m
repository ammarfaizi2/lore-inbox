This is only true for the short-term future.

Whether Linux is better off with improved hardware support through 
binary modules for the long-term future is a more difficult question. 
Arjan recently posted an extreme example of the dangers of hardware 
support through binary modules [1].

You might agree or disagree with such opinions. But it has already been 
discussed to death on this list, and unless you are a troll you should 
read the past flamewars^Wdiscussions regarding this topic in the mailing 
list archives instead of restarting the same old discussion.

If you can accept the fact that less people consider your project useful 
than you might have hoped, there is no reason for you to not implement 
your project.
