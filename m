         Hi,

    How to change the serial port driver ?
    I mean,  I have written a dummy simple serial
    port driver.   I want,  my driver to respond
    for any activity on COM1 and COM2,  instead
    of standard serial driver,  that comes along with
    Linux kernel.

    How can I do this ?

        Thanks in advance
            Vinayak
