Hi,

I apologize for intruding into your busy schedule. Please allow me to introduce ourselves to you.

We are engaged in providing book-related services to international clientele (http://www.e-BookServices.com). Located in
India, we cater to both organizations as well as individuals. 

Our range of services include, but are not limited to:
- Typesetting (QuarkXPress, InDesign, FrameMaker etc) 
- Formatting of manuscripts (MS-Word, WordPerfect etc) 
- Graphic Design and Pre-Press jobs (including logo/book cover design) 
- Desktop Publishing (DTP) 
- Keying-in, scanning and OCR (for re-prints, archives, web publishing etc) 
- Translation (from and to all major languages) 
- e-Books Creation (PDFs, MobiPocket etc) 
- XML Conversion 

Many companies are now outsourcing their work to India. Not only do they achieve substantial cost savings, but the
availability of a large number of professionally trained personnel also ensures a high quality of work. We can serve you
efficiently and cost effectively, and deliver as per your customized needs. 

We are one of the leading Indian organizations in our field, and serve many international organizations. For accomplishing
jobs with us, a team of highly trained and dedicated professionals work at our state-of-the-art facilities located in New
Delhi, India.

We understand the basic international business processes and ensure that all projects undertaken by us are completed within
the stipulated time period with complete confidentiality, accuracy, and quality.

For your first project you do not need to pay us a deposit. You can make the entire payment after receiving satisfactory
delivery of service. 

If you are interested in cutting your current costs to at least half, increasing your profit margins without compromising
on the quality and turn-around time, then please do get back to us. We will be glad to send you a most competitive business
proposal. 

I shall be at the FRANKFURT BOOK FAIR (19th-23rd October, 2005) and would be most happy to meet you there and personally
discuss your requirements. If so, I would be obliged if you can kindly grant me a prior appointment at the fair.

Sincerely,
 
Dhiraj Aggarwal
