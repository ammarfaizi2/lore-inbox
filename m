Hi Keith,

Whenever I post to linux-kernel with your name in the Cc or To,
the mail bounces back 5 days later with:

----------------------------------------

The original message was received at Sun, 6 May 2001 05:16:14 -0400

Just wanted to let you know so that you're not losing any
important emails.  Seems your machine is refusing mail for some
reason.  Hope this helps.

Take care,
TTYL

Signature poll:  I'm planning on getting a 12 or 16 port autosensing
10/100 ethernet switch soon for home use, and am interested in hearing
others recommendations on what to buy.  Cost isn't as important as is
functionality and quality.  Any suggestions appreciated.
