	I generally recommend some of the following:

	www.securityfocus.com
	www.securityportal.com
	packetstorm.security.com
		(Oh, gee, that's now packetstormsecurity.org)

	www.rootshell.com use to be pretty good, but it's been getting
long in the tooth lately and hasn't changed in ages.

	Each of those has additional links to other sites.

	Then find the security pages for your distro.  RedHat, Turbo,
and most of the other good ones have pages for errata's and security
announcements.  Find them and check them out.

	Couple of good books out there too...  I helped write "Hacking
Linux Exposed" and Bob Toxin has "Real World Linux Security" that you
might find interesting.
