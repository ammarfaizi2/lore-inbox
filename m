I would be very interested in this if it leads to more people *looking* at the
tests results. 

Automating this stuff is the easy part - getting intelligence out of the 
results is harder.
The more eyeballs we can get to look, the easier this gets. 

If a new list, or better use of an old list will help, i'll change whatever is 
necessary.
If people like the Web, but don't like our paper layout, i'll change that too.
