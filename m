Hi,
My name is Alvaro de Luna and I'm looking for a Linux
canbus drive. Sometime ago I bought a board that has
two Intel AN82527 Can controller devices.
But it isn't a normal board.
His memory map is paged. Each device occupies 16 pages
of 16 bytes, and I don't know if there is a driver that
works.

Can anybody help me?

Regards,
	Alvaro.
