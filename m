Shawn,

Obviously you can not and will not listen to reason.
I can make it become hardware, using a CAM card.

Do not preach to me about DMCA, if it was not for me, you and everyone in
the world would be saddled with it.  The other folks involved in that
issue forced it underground, and I will bet we are saddled with it now.

http://www.sigmadesigns.com/pdf_docs/harmony_brochure.pdf

It is here dude like it or not!  Who is using it?

The PVR people or the SETTOP box people using Linux, and my work!
Read that document and see, where kernel 2.4 drivers for DRM/DMCA are
active in the world.

Who owns a large stake in the copyright for ATA and all of SATA, me.
Yet I have to stand around and wait for it to be quietly stolen, and I
know whos, I know the whens, I know the hows of it all.  I do not know
the exact wheres.  I have a list a mile long and much of the proof.
But I have no money to fight.

There is a precedence about copyright that effects a very big issue, and
bigger than me making money.  I will leave and use another platform over
the issue.

If it is deemed under copyright law and the holders reject binary
modules and the precedene set and used as a legal basis from one statement
in 1995, then it all goes.  Every embedded module, every appliance with a
module, every binary module out there, and a dynamic shift away to other
platforms will result.

So get over yourself, and you have to choice to load or not load a module.
You have a choice to purchase hardware w/ or w/o binary modules.
You have a choice to purchase software as a binary module.

I am part of the latter, but have the ability to stuff it in to a Digital
Rights Management device aka Content Addressable Memory, and provide a
legal gpl driver that is nothing but the original source code wrapper.
You see people are creative enough to find ways to bypass GPL.

If I can do it so can anyone else.
Do I like being forced to use a CAM in order to operate in Linux, NO.

Later ...
