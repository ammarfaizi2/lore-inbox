OK - this is a little off topic so I'll apologize and thank you for your 
help in advance.

I have 4 Linux servers using the Asus A8N-VM CSM motherboard. They all 
have the latest 1001 bios. The all have 4 gigs of ram, and they all have 
dual core athlons.

The problem. 2 out of the 4 sees all 4 gigs of ram. The other 2 see only 
2.8 gigs of ram. And it's hardware related because in the bios setup the 
ones that show 2.8 show it in the bios.

The motherboards were not prchased at the same time. All have different 
brands of ram. And the processors are different. The 2 that don't see 
all the ram are the newest ones.

I tried swapping ram between one that saw 2.8 gigs and one that saw 4 
gigs and the problem stays with the motherboard. I haven't yet swapped 
out the processors.

So - I'm a little stumped. Can someone point me in the right direction?
