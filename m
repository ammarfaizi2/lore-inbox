No true, many of us could careless about credit list.

Sometimes teaching others is a better way to bring them around to your
view point while learning about their goals.  Since everyone/most agree
your T10 knowledge is strong, others have pointed out you are savy enough
to work around problems over fixing them in general.  Blah blah ...

Just show everyone why it can not work the "Linux Way" and defend the
points logically.  Should the defense of it not be possible, then the
point is lost.

SPECs become crap when organizations like STA with T10 make joining and
voting on the technology under NCITS $10,000.00 annual membership.  This
is old boys club rules, otherwise I would have joined and terrorized T10
like I did to T13.  Exclusion breeds distrust.

If this is accurate then it is fair to raise a question; however, few can
stand in judgement because they were present in for the discussions.  The
remander (self included) are in the dark.
