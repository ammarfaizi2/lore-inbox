Subject: Problem with module versioning in 2.4.0

See below for my origional problem.  It seems the problem lies in the
module versioning option.

After I reported the following, I tried compileing Unix Sockets into the
kernel.  The system loaded fine, but I was unable to get PCMCIA to work
properly.  Someone then recomended that I turn module versioning off,
and I did that, unix.o works fine as a module and my PCMCIA network
adapter works fine.

--- Origional Post---
I've had no problems at all with the 2.3 and 2.4.0-test/prerelease
kernels, but now with this "stable" release of 2.4.0 I have a problem. 
When the system boots, I am spammed with the following line:
insmod: /lib/modules/2.4.0/kernel/net/unix/unix.o: insmod net-pf-1
failed

It is all I can see.  I have been trying to figure out what the problem
is.  This is the system:
Mobile Celeron 400
modutils 2.4.1
gcc 2.95.2
binutils 2.10.1
glibc 2.1.3

Thanks for any help,
Jeremy
