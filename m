Hehe, I wish I had sent that email early in the morning, not in the
evening before putting away the computer :-) I could have had an online
show over this minor, trivial issue :-)

Anyway, now that the fact is clear that there actually exist -mm
patches, we'll be _patiently_ waiting for hpa's work on the -mm scripts,
or any other solution for that matter. It's up to you and I think a lot
of people would be glad and thankful for the brilliant scripting work
of the www.kernel.org web admin.

Regards, have a good day folks,
Maciej
