Hallo l-k,

I have problem with lockup i810 DRI on my Debian sid machine.

Problem can be reproduced: I start the X server, then I start Mozilla
browser. When I'm loading some http page, I switch to the text console (I
don't use framebuffer). Then I get lockup.

Environment:
Kernel: 2.5.69-mm2
XFree86: 4.2.1-6 (debian sid package)

# lsmod (after lockup)

Fatal server error:
lockup

I can unload i810 module, but when I try to load it again and then start
X server, X server stop loading, when try to initialize DRI. I can work
via ssh, but not on the console: console is waiting to initialize X
session.

My .config is in the attachment.

Any other info's on demand ;-)

Sincerely
Jan Marek
