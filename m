It's a general rule that clauses in a contract (which an NDA is) are null and
unenforcable if they compel you to do something illegal.  In addition, clauses
can be held unenforcable if they are "unconscionable", i.e. if they compel you
to do something totally out of line and unreasonable.  This is why almost all
contracts have a separability clause.

"Thou shalt not tell the ingredients of the secret sauce" is enforcable.
"Thou shalt not tell others that the secret sauce contains high levels of
dangerous carcinogens" is unconscionable. 

Also, note that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides a lot of protection for
whistleblowers: http://www.workindex.com/editorial/expert/expview.asp
on top of the usual legal havens.

See? That's my point exactly - you *weren't* prohibited from reporting illegal
activity.
