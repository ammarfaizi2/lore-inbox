    Hi Margit :)

    Finally was PoweRec! Today I used another pack of discs (same
brand, same kind) that, I don't know why, seemed to be of higher
quality and I was able to burn at 48x with no problem. The PoweRec
thought that the media was of very high quality, and it was,
certainly, because the disc was perfectly written :)) It can even be
read on my old CD-ROM drive!!!

    Another problem is the audio. No matter the media quality, I can
only write at 16x and the system slows to a crawl. I'll keep
investigating the issue and if I discover anything, I'll tell you.

    Thanks for all your help and for solving this mistery to me ;)
