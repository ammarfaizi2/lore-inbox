Including a BSD license where source code is never released?  Or dot-net 
application servers hosted on a Linux system under lock and key in a vault 
somewhere?  And no termination clause, so this jerk can still sue you over 
other frivolous patents?

So you would object to microsoft granting rights to its patents saying "you 
can use this patent in software that runs on windows, but use it on any other 
platform and we'll sue you", but you don't mind going the other way?

Either way BSD gets the shaft, of course.  But then BSDI was doing that them 
a decade ago, and Sun hired away Bill Joy and forked off SunOS years before 
that, so they should be used to it by now... :)  (And BSD runs plenty of GPL 
application code...)

Imagine a slimeball company that puts out proprietary software, gets a patent 
on turning a computer on, and sues everybody in the northern hemisphere ala 
rambus.  They run a Linux system in the corner in their office, therefore 
they are "a linux user".  How do you stop somebody with that mindset from 
finding a similarly trivial loophole in your language?  (Think Spamford 
Wallace.  Think the CEO of Rambus.  Think Unisys and the gif patent.  Think 
the people who recently got a patent on JPEG.  Think the british telecom 
idiots trying to patent hyperlinking a decade after Tim Berners-Lee's first 
code drop to usenet...)

Today, all these people do NOT sue IBM, unless they're really stupid.  (And 
if they do, they will have cross-licensed their patent portfolio with IBM in 
a year or two.  Pretty much guaranteed.)
