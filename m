Excuse me...I've been a lurker and sometimes tester since 2.0.*. I've
been working my way through man (3) to learn enough to submit a coherent
patch and I don't appreciate you telling me I can't do it. I've searched
your submissions to LKML and all I see are opinions, ie ==
!code_submitted.

Who exactly are "we" anyway? I know it's not me because I haven't
contributed DIDDLY for code just yet. 

Just a note: CD Burner, Parport/ECP/EPP/Zip broken with 2.4.17, will try
2.4.19. 2.4.18 too ugly to test. 


Apologies to the kernel-list, I usually try to limit my noise...
