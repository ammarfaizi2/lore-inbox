MR SAMANJA GARUBA,
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY,
PRETORIA,SOUTH AFRICA.
 
01-09-2003


Sir,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to
me by a member of the South African Export Promotion council(SAEPC) Who was with the Government delegation
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to
seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business.

Within the department of Minerials & Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project implementation
and with the co-operation of two other top officials we have in our possession an overdue payment in Us
funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my
department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of
US$14.500,000.00(Fourteen Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the excess balance unclaimed.

Since the elected Government is determined to pay contractors all their debts owed, so as to maintain
good relationship with the foreign governments and non-government agencies, we include our approvals with
the Department of Finance and the Reserve bank of South Africa(RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to
front as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals
will be secured on behalf of you/your company.

I have the authorities of my partners to propose that should you be willing to asist us in this transaction
your share as compensation will be US$3.625M(25%), while my colleagues and I receive US$9.425M(65%) and
the balance of US$1.45(10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses incured.

The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not
matter whether you/your company does contract projects as a transfer of powers will be secured in  favour of
you/your company. Also, your area of specialization is not a hinderance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and I hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me on my confidential email address as provided. I will also prefer you to provide me with your telephone and fax number where i can reach you immediately for proper discussion for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal. Please, note that response should be to the email addresses provided.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.

Regards,

MR. SAMANJA GARUBA.
