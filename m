       SafeInternetEmail Notification [reference number: j67NfHC07460]


Greetings,

This is an automatic notification generated by the Safe Internet Email system,
in response to a message which appears to have originated from your email
account.  See http://safeinternetemail.com/ for details about this service.

The SIE scanner has intercepted what appears to be a virus infected message
from your account.

Your email message has been blocked from delivery because of one of
the following reasons:

1) You sent a message with a virus infected attachment.

2) Your computer is infected with a virus and it sent an infected attachment,
   possibly without your awareness.

3) Someone else's computer is infected and it sent a virus with an infected
   attachment, but the message had a forged address belonging to you on it.

4) You sent a harmless file, which was inadvertently flagged as being 
   virus infected.

For additional assistance, please contact your local IT or Service Provider
support staff.
