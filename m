	That's fine then, if you want to define derivative work in this way, then I
can configure, compile, and link the Linux kernel without permission of the
copyright holder under first sale (since no derivative work is created). I
can write a program that uses a library, compile my program, and link it to
the library, again without creating a derivative work.

	Okay. This gets to the same result that I get to, which is that you can do
all the things you want to do without permission from the copyright holder
under first sale. Since this is not creating a derivative work, no special
permission is needed.

	Read the quote above.

	Read the quote. For about the fourth time in this thread, here's the cite:
http://emoglen.law.columbia.edu/publications/lu-12.html "The license does
not require anyone to accept it in order to acquire, install, use, inspect,
or even experimentally modify GPL'd software."

	I don't know what to say. The FSF has had a clear, consistent position on
the GPL for a very long time and it has always been that ordinary use is
permitted without agreeing to the GPL. For source code, modification is
often part of ordinary use. Anyone who has grabbed a package intended for a
different version of their OS and had to tweak things to get the code to
work knows this.

	I never said that the FSF says the GPL does not cover modifications, I said
it doesn't cover ordinary use. That means it doesn't cover modifications
when those modifications are made in the course of ordinary use.

	Okay. So you get to the same place I get by a different route. One of the
strange things I've noticed is nearly all cases, you get the same result
whether you think the final work is a derivative work or not.

	I don't think courts seem to agree with this, but I can only find cases
where the result really would have been the same whether or not the work was
derivative. For example, one case inolved a company that stole test
questions from another company. The courts ruled that the test with some of
the "borrowed" questions was a derivative work, even though there's no
special "integration" of the questions. But they could perfectly well have
reached the same conclusion without the "derivative work" argument.

	There are court cases on point that definitely disagree with you, for
example Mirage Editions, Inv. v. Albuquerque ART (cutting a picture out of a
book creates a derivative work). Also National Football League v. TVRadio
Now (embedding someone else's broadcast with your advertisements through an
automated process creates a derivative work).

	I think it would make a lot of sense if courts held that compiling and
linking are analogous to format changes (like converting an audio-visual
work from DVD to VHS). This process involves making copies of the work so
that it can be used in different environments that have different technical
requirements. (Except in cases where one work is heavily adapted to the
internals of another.) It's clear that anyone who tried to get an
independent copyright on their compiled Linux kernel binary should be
laughed off the planet.

	This has always been their position, when modification is needed for
ordinary use. See the quote from Eben Moglen above. Now, as I said, they
reach different conclusions based on this, but we agree on this.
