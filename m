Please be more specific or stop posting. No one is going to bother 
answering you with any useful answer unless you are more specific.

 From the general trend of the thread so far, it seems like a fairly 
pointless request to me.

All well known distros had absolutely no problem with devfs -> udevd 
transition, so why are you having problems?

If you stop spending time posting, you might actually have time to fix 
your problems.
