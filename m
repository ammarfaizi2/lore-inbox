Chris,

Although your interest in development issues that arise with the Linux
kernel code should be applauded, I must advise you to refrain from
posting any prose that has the possibility of inciting laughter among
LKML subscribers.  While messages that intentionally humiliate others
are widely accepted and used, humor, on the the other hand, is NOT
CONDONED.




...Yes, I'm just kidding  ;-)
