You're not alone, I think everybody who knows, how things in a=20
computer work shares this view.

A few years ago I had some closer contact with a driver developer of a=20
well known consumer HW manufacturer hunting down some nasty bugs I=20

developers and engineers would have no problem to disclose the=20

suprisingly - marketing departments; with little more knowledge about=20
the internals of their products, for them _everything_ created within=20
the company is considered as not to be leaked, valuable information=20
by them.
