Hi all,
Am a newbie and this is my first post. I just
installed Redhat7.1 (one I downloaded) and it's
working well even hooked it up to the internet. I
checked my /usr/src/ and I don't find a /linux
directory. I find only one directory... /redhat. It
there something wrong somewhere, or do I have to
download a kernel source seperately. Doing uname -r
shows me that I have 2.4.x.x.

Thanks.
Frank.
