This whole metadata discussion leads me to another question which has
been bothering me about BK's 'Open' Logging and hosted trees for a
while. What is happening to all the infomation that BitMover is (or
could gather) from people accessing the Open Logging site as well as
the hosted repositories? There could be a lot of marketing value in
this if BM decided to abuse it. Ie. some marketing manager could
decide to run advertisement campaigns listing names of known
individuals using the software.

I just checked http://www.bitkeeper.com/Sales.Licensing.Free.html and
the word 'privacy' does not occur on that page at all.

While I understand BK need for a license to publish the metadata, then
I'd be a lot more comfortable with a written guarantee restricting the
use to the logging site or similar.
