I appreciate all the feedback. Based on the wide variety 
of ideas/comments, it looks like I need to go back and 
incorporate these ideas into the document, potentially 
changing areas in major ways where appropriate.    

Rather than bog down this mailing list with exchanges, 
I would like to move this discussion to the hardened 
driver mailing list.  Please don't feel like I'm 
ignoring your feedback--just moving the forum.

An underlying theme tends to revolve around the binding
of the concepts of 'hardening' and RAS features being 
added to drivers.  We will be looking into splitting 
these two different approaches out from this singular 
document and into their appropriate locations.

If you are interested (even if you aren't) please go 
to http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/hardeneddrivers-discuss 
and subscribe to the mailing list.
