Are you not worried that with the GPLv2 also has the
clause where if patents not themselves open for use
then the whole work becomes non-distributable anymore?
Ie, nobody could work on the Linux kernel anymore. I
mean, I don't think the FSF would screw people over,
if they did nobody would use the GPL license and that
would hurt them. I really don't understand why it has
to be a 'us vs them' mentality here. We're all trying
to create Free/Open software.

I'm more concerned that with GPLv2 license as it is,
may put the kernel in danger of itself being
non-distributable in any sort of way (patents, or
other ways?).

I don't personally care if the kernel is v2 or v3, my
concern is the kernel source itself is safe from evil
interests out there.
