As I explained three lines below the mail, if you care to read.

We recently saw that creating a new, probably incompatible compiler is a
very bad thing. If sgi would split the compiler that would be a problem
for the community at large.

YANAL and IANAL, but to defend code you must own it or have authored it.
Since the FSF would, in your example, neither own the code nor be the
author of it they couldn't defend that version of gcc.

Well, simply this is _not_ the case ;)

You don't. Lawyers do (certainly the FSD lawyer does), and probably the
law does, also ;)
