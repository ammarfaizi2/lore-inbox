Justin,

I've seen a special U320 driver aic79xx v1.10, but I suppose that the new
U320 controllers will be folded into a new version of your aic7xxx driver
(?).  If so, I'd like to know which version of the aic7xxx driver will
include support of the new aic7902 controller, and which kernel version will
be targeted to have that folded in.  

Andy
