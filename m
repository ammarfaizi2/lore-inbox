Some people can't deal with the earthquakes, brush fires, and 
landslides for some reason.  (Did I mention my house is sliding off a 
cliff?)  Weather and natural beauty however is my reason for being in 
California..., to hell with face time with smart people.  The only 
reason I may wear a jacket is because my wife prefers the way it 
appears, not because of the weather ;-).  Sillicon Valley is too cold 
for my tastes.  Driving distance from small John Wayne airport in 
Southern California with a nice ~ hour flight away from Sillicon 
Valley is just right.  Though the history in Europe/UK is very 
interesting..., some day.

Todays forecast- 78, yesterdays forcast... 78, 3 months ago 
forecast... 78, etc. .  (Not exactly, but its in the ballpark)
