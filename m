Unfortunately this is not proof  :-(    I can tell you from personal
experience that the BSD kernels are much more sensitive to overheating
hardware than linux is, for example -- so one linux kernel could just
as easily be more sensitive to overheating than another linux kernel.

I've never found out why this is, but I know it's true.  When I try
to run a BSD kernel on a dust-covered motherboard I'll get random
crashes all over the place even though a linux kernel will run just
fine on the same machine.  All I do is blow the dust off the motherboard
and both kernels run again without problem.  Absolutely for sure.

I'd love to know what makes the difference.
