GNU is not so important in new system. I take gcc and glibc as to be
outside the GNU project. (they have now the GNU mark only for GNU
convenience, IMHO) I use "GNU/Linux" only to make more explicit the
"copyleft" ideas, but surelly not because of the GNU tools.

If you insist with such arguments, you risk that someone will rewrite
the basic GNU tools outside the GNU project (emacs is not an OS main tool,
gcc and glibc are de facto outside GNU) (bash will remain GNU ?)

RMS: maybe you can reply me privatly about some more explication of your mail,
so less OT mail, and privately maybe I can understand more about GNU/Linux flames.
