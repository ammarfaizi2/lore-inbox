	Hello Florian (&all) ,  BK is (primarily in this community) used
	by the kernel maintainers .  What happens to the little guy who
	may make a once a year contribution & uses BK ?  Also what methods
	of announcement for New BK versions are there ?  Because as soon
	as a new version is advertised the copy I am using even if I am
	unaware of the newer version I do not have a valid license to use
	it .  This is per your remarks below .
	I'd -really- like to see what would happen if something like this
	were placed on the GCC sources .  Me thinks linus et-al would be
	creating their own compiler .  Just some food for thought .
		Twyl ,  JimL
