Hello,

***** Please note I am not on the Linux Kernel Mailing List.  Please
be so kind as to BCC copy me in on any reply to this inquiry.  Thanks
in
advance. *****

I have had a recent experience in using the "EXTRAVERSION" in the
Linux 2.2.x Kernel series.  The context of my question applies to both
the 2.2.x and 2.4.x Linux Kernels.

The questions are:

  1) Is there a specification that states the maximum length that the
"EXTRAVERSION" string may be?
  2) Does the Kernel make/build process enforce any specified limit of
(1) above?
  3) If (1) exists, where might it be documented?  I have tried to
find out, but with no success thus far.
  4) Is anyone aware that there may be some differences in what is
supported by or works with the Kernel and the programs that support
the Linux Kernel?

Please BCC me by replacing yahoo.com after the "@" as follows"
TLD =         The last three letters of the word internet
Domain name = The first four letters of the word software,
              followed by the last four letters of the word
              homeless.
My appologies in advance for the jumbled eMail address
and request to BCC me, but SPAM has become a very serious
problem.  The eMail address in my header information is
not a valid eMail address for me.  I needed to use a valid
domain due to ISP SMTP screen rules.
