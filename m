The attitude of the both of you basically means "Windows XP" for
anyone wanting to do _anything_ useful with their laptop besides
trying to test out new kernels and new any exciting ways to break
suspend/resume. You might want to reevaluate your positions to
actually accomplish anything.

ATM all I see is "this is my toy" - "no, this is my toy" from both of
you.
