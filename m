Sometimes i use an old Pentium 133 classic (no mmx), and it works, well to
do this with X11 and netscape. I think we are starting to be used to PC
that are too powerful. :) If you go to fast how can you see where you are
going? ;)
OK, it was a joke...

I would like to know, if your CPU is on a laptop, are you sure that your
power management works well?

Is it working ok with 2.4.6? and 2.4.8-pre3?
