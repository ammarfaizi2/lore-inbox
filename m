As long as the maintainers know who the lieutenants are, nobody under them 
should really have to care that much...

I.E. the people who knew it knew it, and hence never noticed the problem...

There are, however, some people writing largeish bits of code that did not in 
fact seem to know it.  Andre Hedrick's IDE work, Eric Raymond with the help 
files and CML2, Kieth Owens' new build process...  Maybe it was even a factor 
in Alan Cox burning out (you'd have to ask him about that)...
