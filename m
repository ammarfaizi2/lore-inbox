Are you talking about one of those "eavesdropper" 
parabolic microphones?  Are you thinking of having 
someone on stage redirecting the microphone as
each speaker starts talking?  It could work well,
but you'd either lose the first few words each
person in the audience said or need to go to a
"hand raising/acknowledgement" to create a pause
during which the microphone could be redirected.
