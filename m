I'm hoping someone will step up to the plate and let me know who is maintaining the cpqfc driver.  If someone needs access to hardware, I can certainly grant that.  Or failing that, mail an array and cpqfc card to whomever.

I see the cpqfc driver is in Andrew Morton's "must-fix" list, and I'd love to help out.  I can also supply access to a SAN environment using Emulex cards (I'm using their Sourceforge drivers) as well as the aforementioned cpqfc cards.
