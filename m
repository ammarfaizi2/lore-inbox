well, apart from sony 510i cell, and cam, i have managed to get
installed everything that i need for my work, or which i cant live
without,

I was speaking of all this, cause i am tired to everyone peskering me,
arguing with me how linux cannot work with my "insert new hardware" ,
I have to google stuff out and hand-hold them to get it working, this
was cool to do some years ago, when i didnt bother to work full time
and felt good helping others, now that feel good factor has ran out,
and i get more annoyed than anything else. I dont think i can explain
why did i post this. maybe someone somewhere will get it.

anyway, nevermind.

sorry to anyone who was hurt/offended here. sorry if linus reads this
and gets pissed off, sorry to cox and morton if they feel same.

peace,
anshuman.
