While I don't work for one of these organisation, I am involved with one.
I've certainly seem "corporate IT" dictate a specific platform. The
response from the project / device engineers was "Do you want this product
to ship, or do you want us to conform to corporate IT?".

Considering the amount of money involved, it was no surprise that
corporate IT desires were overridden.

segment versus what you listed. All those costs pale into insignificance.
