Other people think that "buffer" is one of those words which have been
used for similar meanings in many disciplines.  In computing it is a
region of storage used to reduce data rate variations.  In materials
handling it is a machine for rubbing away surface imperfections in leather
or metal (reducing surface variations).  In railroading it's a
spring-loaded piston used to absorb the energy of low-speed impacts
(reducing speed discrepancies).  It could be applied to any mechanism
designed to mitigate unwanted differences.
