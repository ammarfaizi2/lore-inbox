This is a good example of the kind of rubbish that is sometimes talked around 
here. I've lost count of the number of times I've heard the 'Windows is SO 
unstable argument' it almost seems like a religion. I would agree with what 
you have said if Windows was actually unusable 40% of the time. Do you really 
believe this figure? In reality it is much better than that as plainly the 
majority of the WORLD are using it. I love Linux but I also use Windows. 
Sorry to break your delusion, it ain't that bad.

Its very true that in the Windows world you have to wait for Micro$oft 
sometimes, it is even true that they probably hold back features so that can 
put them in the next release and get you to pay for them. Why is this any 
worse than expecting Joe User, who is a 'user' and not a 'developer' to 
rebuild the most important bits of his OS and risk breaking the whole lot.

This is not about Windows v Linux so please stop compraring what I have 
proposed to Windows. This debate should be about Performance v Usability. 
Source interfaces have ultimate performance, nobody has suggested, yet, that 
they are easier for Joe User than a binary interface.
