Hi,
I got one card SATA 150 TX2 plus with version v1.00.0.20 on chip.
I want to make it working under SuSE linux 8.0. I have downloaded
drivers from www.promise.com, but driver is not working, because of bad
major/minor numbers of /dev/sda, /dev/sda1, /dev/sdb, .....
What are the major/minor numbers for making it work?

Or is there any other driver that I should use for making this card =
working?
What are major/minor numbers for that drivers?
Thanks very much for your answers.
