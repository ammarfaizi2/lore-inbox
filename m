Okay, folks. Now i propose to go further than that.

I hope that Larry recognises that at some point the linux kernel community
_will_ switch to a free software alternative.

I think we should have a better choice than the lossy bk->cvs.

I propose we as a whole ask Larry to create a bk->arch gateway _not_ via cvs
but directly, and therefore using all the extended metadata possible.

	- this way we`ll get whole-tree changesets, file renames etc.
	- this way Larry will have a terrific argument to shut whiners.

The choice of Arch is not random, but motivated by my belief in that it is
the leading Free Software revision control effort.

If Larry wishes to give a birth to this idea, the list to contact is:

	gnu-arch-users@gnu.org
