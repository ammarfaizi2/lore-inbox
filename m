Give me a break!
Did may the idea perhaps occur to you that maybe the above wish list is:

1. Utterly immoral.
2. Something you are by no ways entitled to have.

If you want to be compensated for BK then put a price tag on it.
So what are you now trying to do is basically to use peoples wish to 
contribute to

commercial endeavor... that simply plain isn't fair play.
