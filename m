Wrong. You need a license to receive terrestrial TV but that is
rather different and relates to both cultural and historical tax
differences in philosophy between the US and UK.

The big problem with 'soft' radios is transmit. You can hotwire
your centrino. People in the UK are already trying to use US drivers
in Windows XP because "they go further". If you listen to police
transmissions then its ultimately poor police security, if you transmit
on their frequency then its a lot more serious because you might
interfere with emergency services.
