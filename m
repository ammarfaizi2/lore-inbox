I have one small question about the Linux mixer device.  I realize that
the drivers (such as OSS and ALSA) have their own standards for the mixer
and dsp devices and such, and so I'm not really sure if this is on topic
or not.  If you're still interested in my question, tho, read on ;p.

I've noticed that with some audio devices, I have a Bass and Treble
setting that I can play with (and usually do, becuase it makes things
sound MUCH better).  Why don't I have that in some devices, and is there
a way (through the kernel, or through a userspace program) to make up the
difference?  I use mpg123 to play my mp3 files, but that will change soon
as I am building myself a new installation of Linux (from the kernel on up
;p... the Distributions aren't keeping up as much as I want and I want all
my own home-built software anyway, except for X, 'cuz that's a bitch to
attempt to compile on my own).

Anyway, does anybody know the answer to that one?

	Thanks!
	Mike
