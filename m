Can anyone guide me in choosing the appropriate port of Java for Linux
2.4.17 and glibc-2.2.2-10
Which is the best of the three?
Blackdown Java
IBM JAVA
Sun Java

I have heard that Blackdown supports native threads...while IBM and SUN do
not!!
Any kind of help will be greatly appreciated.....

If this mailing list id not the right place for the above question....can
anyone guide me to an appropriate mailing list

Thanks,
Anish
