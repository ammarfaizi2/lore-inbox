hi imel,

with all respect: the problem is that you do not listen.

as people keep trying to point out to you:

- you can have your single-user centric user environment (no logon)

while

- retaining advantages of multi-user security

no kernel changes needed.

ie: you can have your phone's user environment come straight up
(without needing a login or anything) and have security so that the
phone user can't do harmful things like delete system files.

you can have the best of all worlds...
