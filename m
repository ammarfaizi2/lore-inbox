Hi Jeff,

Thanks, I'll add that to my bookmarks as well, but it's still missing
some important stuff, like how to roll back to a specific commit id
and git-bisect ;-) It seems a bit more targetted towards being a git
tree maintainer than a client.

Having some of this linked off git.kernel.org would be wonderful too
since at least for me seems to be the most logical place for anyone to
start looking for info.

Thanks,
Jes
