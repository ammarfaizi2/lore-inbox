Andrew,

Thanks. I had wanted to convey the gist of what you say to someone
earlier this week.  It would have been nice to point to some document
that captures this, and though I looked around, I haven't found anything
in one place, surprisingly. It's a plea kernel maintainers frequently make
to Linux contributors, but new projects seem to run into the same problems
repeatedly. I figured it would be worth putting together your comments
and some basic related advice given to those wishing to get their
code into the kernel in a document. Hope that's ok.

File follows in a separate mail.

thanks,
Nivedita
