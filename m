I haven't gotten authorization from people using this beowulf cluster to
try 2.4.13-ac7 yet! :)  I did however compile it.  I kind of reverted back
to 2.4.2 before I became convinced of 2.4.13-ac7's virtues... So you
really think 2.4.13-ac7 has some cool hw bug workarounds? I guess I should
read about what went into -ac7.... Where would be a good place to find
more info?
