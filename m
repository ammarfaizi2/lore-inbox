All,

I updated the Cisco local directors in front of this email cluster.  ECN
should work now, let me know if you have any further troubles.

Adelphia isn't a bad ISP, we are just a little to big for our own good
sometimes, and getting in touch with the right people to solve problems like
this is probably harder than it should be, and I apologize.
