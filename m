No, but you are apparently talking about a totally different thing
again.

I cannot find sources for the *proDVD* version there. Yes, I even
corrected the typo.

If you mean that the newer alphas are all "proDVD" versions because they
now contain dvd-support, you're just confusing people here.

Even more so because *you already know* that I compiled the new alphas
myself. Trying them and having my cdburner not working anymore made me
start all this.

By asking such question, assuming "insider" knowledge and despite you
already knowing the answer, you're not helping people to focus on the
real problem,

ciao
