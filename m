Dear sir,PRISDENT/CEO

INVESTMENT PROPOSAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION US DOLLARS

I am pleased to write you in order to inform you of my
good intention to invest or form a joint partnership
business with you. I am one of the directors in
security and exchange commission in charge of payment
of dividends of stock market. 

>We have investors both local and foreign who
deposited Millions of Dollars in stock market. By
virtue of my position as director incharge of payment
of dividend to investors, I discovered that one of our
clients a (foreigner)who deposited fifteen million
dollars with the commission (stock market) died two
years ago and no records to show that he had a
relation or next
of kin to claim this dividends. All effort to trace
his relative proof
abortive. 

Now, we have initiated an arrangement to transfer
Fifteen Million Dollars(US$15,000,000) accrued as
dividends and interest on deposit of Fifteen Million
Dollars in reliable foreigner who is willing and able
to receive this money as a bonafide next of kin, or
relations to the late investor.

We have concluded arrangement to support and prove
that whoever receive this fund is a bonafide relation
or next of kin to the late investor, this is why I
have decided to contact you for assistance to receive
this money (US$15M) and invest it in your company for
a period of one year or more as may be subject to
negotiation. I strongly believe this is an opportunity
for you to increase your capital base of your company.

If this proposal is accepted by you, kindly forward
you honest response to the email address above for
more information and of cause your opinion shall be
welcomed concerning this transaction.

Please treat us urgent and confidential.
