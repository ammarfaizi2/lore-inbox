As the person  who first brought Iraq into this thread, I have to say this:  If
you think I was comparing the US to Iraq then you're mistaken.  I was merely
pointing out Iraq (semi-jokingly) as an example of a country that would not care
about enforcing US laws.

I firmly believe that if justice prevails in the existing DMCA cases you
will be shown to be right. I've seen people compare the US to Iraq and
I don't buy that.

However until people stop shooting I'd prefer not to be a potential target.
