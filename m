Even RedHat with a stronger financial background than Debian considered 
the MP3 patents being serious enough to remove MP3 support.

Yes, Debian can choose to put a higher risk on their distributors and 
mirrors - there's nothing wrong with this.


Note that this is a respose to Josselin's statement:

When there are several possible interpretations, you have to pick up the
more conservative one, as it's not up to us to make the interpretation,
but to a court.

It's simply silly to be extremely picky on copyright issues while being 
extremely liberal on patent issues - the risk of a Debian distributor 
being sued for patent violations (no matter how the lawsuit might end) 
is definitely present.

Which one of the 23 patents they list do you call "this particular 
patent"?
