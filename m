    2005 International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC'05)
   International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery 
                          (FSKD'05)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

                27 - 29 August 2005, Changsha, China

           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

             *** Submission Deadline: 15 March 2005 ***

      FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS, SPECIAL SESSIONS, AND SPONSORSHIP

The ICNC'05-FSKD'05 will feature the most up-to-date research results 
in computational algorithms inspired from nature, including biological,

ecological, and physical systems. It is an exciting and emerging
inter-
disciplinary area in which a wide range of techniques and methods are 
being studied for dealing with large, complex, and dynamic problems. 
The joint conferences will also promote cross-fertilization over these

exciting and yet closely-related areas. Registration to either 
conference will entitle a participant to the proceedings and technical

sessions of both conferences, as well as the conference banquet, 
buffet lunches, and tours to some attractions in Changsha. 

Specific areas include, but are not limited to neural computation, 
evolutionary computation, quantum computation, DNA computation, 
chemical computation, information processing in cells and tissues, 
molecular computation, computation with words, fuzzy computation, 
granular computation, artificial life, swarm intelligence, ants 
colony, artificial immune systems, etc., with applications to 
knowledge discovery, finance, operations research, and more.

Publications
------------
The ICNC'05 and FSKD'05 conference proceedings will be published in 
Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) and Lecture Notes 
in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI), respectively. Both the LNCS and 
LNAI are indexed in SCI-Expanded. A selected number of authors will be
invited to expand and revise their papers for possible inclusions in 
peer-reviewed international journals / edited books.

Special Sessions
----------------
In addition to regular sessions, participants are encouraged to 
organize special sessions on specialized topics. Each special session 
should have at least 4 papers. Special session organizers will solicit

submissions and conduct reviews on the submitted papers. Proposals for
special sessions should be sent to the respective Program Chairs, 
i.e., 
        Ke Chen (neural computation, Ke.Chen@manchester.ac.uk)
        Yew Soon Ong (other topics in ICNC'05, asysong@ntu.edu.sg)
        Yaochu Jin (FSKD'05, yaochu.jin@honda-ri.de)

About Changsha, Hunan, China
----------------------------
Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, is a historic and cultural 
city in southern China and a busy port on the Xiangjiang River, with a

population over 6 million. Founded 3000 years ago, the city became the

capital of the Zhou state (951-960 AD) and a leading commercial center

during the Song dynasty (960-1279 AD). Changsha International Airport 
is easily accessible with direct flights to all major domestic and 
some international destinations. Other famous tourist destinations in 
Hunan include the Zhangjiajie National Park (natural heritage listed 
by UN) and Fenghuang (Phoenix) Ancient City.
