A chronology of the SI metric system
Important dates in the history of the modern metric system:
1585
In his book "The Tenth" Simon Stevin suggests that a decimal system should be 
used for weights and measures, coinage, and divisions of the degree of arc.
1670
Authorities give credit for originating the metric system to Gabriel Mouton, 
a French vicar, on about this date.
1790
Thomas Jefferson proposed a decimal-based measurement system for the United 
States.
France's Louis XVI authorized scientific investigations aimed at a reform of 
French weights and measures.  These investigations led to the development of 
the first "metric" system.
1792
The U.S. Mint was formed to produce the world's first decimal currency (the 
U.S. dollar consisting of 100 cents).
1795
France officially adopted the metric system.
1812
Napoleon temporarily suspended the compulsory provisions of the 1795 metric 
system adoption.
1840
The metric system reinstated as the compulsory system in France.
