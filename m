TT is just great. If all commercial companies are like that. Noone could 
object commercialism in OSS. [1] GTK+ people are being cheap and go blame Qt 
for being GPL. Now TT puts a great product there with great help system for 
free  so I would better shut up or put up.

Gnome is great for icons yeah. But KDE ( with -devs -apps ) are great. Not 
ready for %90 of desktop out there but getting there. I suggest Gnome people 
stop whining about Qt but creating a usable GTK+ file dialog at least.

[1] : Its nice of BitKeeper to provide CVS and SVN gateways. People should 
appreciate it.
