Hello Friend.
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me because i believe everyone will die someday. My name is Sanni Saed, a merchant in Dubai U.A.E.

I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. 

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business asthat was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the moneyin the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity ganizations, as I want this to be one of the last good
deeds I do on earth.

Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to
be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eight million united states
dollars that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10 % for you and for your time.All correspondence should be directed to my private email sannisaed@netscape.net

God be with you.

Regards,
Sanni Saed.
