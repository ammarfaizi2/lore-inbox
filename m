the fact that simple forms of life still exist shows only one thing: often
the environment is so harsh (ie. so *random*) that only the simplest can
survive. This is not 'success', it's a bow towards chaos.

the other reason is that simple forms of life are often just a tool for
higher forms of lifes to exist, or do not matter to the existence of
higher forms of life. Lets note that the human race *did* eradicate
certain strains of bacteria from this planet completely (except some more
or less safe places of storage), such as smallpocks, which pretty much
shows who has 'succeeded'.
