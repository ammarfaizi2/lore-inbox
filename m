Oh, ye of little imagination. 

It's only polishing because the new work must merge into the 
framework imposed by the old work (un*x legacy environment). 

If you assume nothing about OS architecture, there are still 
huge vistas of unexplored solution space, where no one has gone
before. It's just really hard for engineers to let go of the 
stuff that works and start climbing from the bottom of the 
mountain.
