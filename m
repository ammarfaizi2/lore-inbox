I just installed Windows XP SP2 and Cygwin:

$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test.img bs=1M count=4096
4096+0 records in
4096+0 records out
4294967296 bytes (4.3GB) copied, 166.27 seconds, 25.8 MB/s

So it works a treat, although it's slower than maybe it should be:  
under linux and the VIA controller I get about 50 MB/sec, but that  
may just be down to the OS.

Where do I start to debug the problem?

Many thanks,
Chris
