We cannot take something away, you never had to begin with. The GPL gives 
you the freedom to modify the source of your driver. If you decide to 
relinquish this freedom by using a binary driver, we respect this 
decision, but this also means we cannot help you if something goes wrong 
with this driver.

bye, Roman
