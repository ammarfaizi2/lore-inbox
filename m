We appreciate your insight! What you just said sounds

LKML is for everything concerning the Linux kernel
development process and well being.  What will we do
about our beloved filesystem now? We must upgrade to
OJFS as all current ReiserFS users face an uncertain
future.  We especially can't have idiots like "Lex
(Luthor?) Lyamin" develop it, if he can't even write
one proper sentence how on earth will he produce a top
quality filesystem?

Thank you,
The OJFS Team (AYBABTU).
