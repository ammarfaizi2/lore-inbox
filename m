FWIW, I (and several others that I have corresponded with) have had good luck
with an ASUS A7A266 as a replacement for a VIA-based board.  It supports at
least 1.2G processors, and I believe I have corresponded with someone using
the 1.33G processor on that board as well.

It's a bit pricey, but if you intend to build a fast system you would want to
compare that to the price of going with a P IV with similar performance (if
that's even possible).

Good luck,
