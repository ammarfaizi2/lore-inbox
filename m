Exactly.

But in this context if user space is not doing the right thing,
you'll lose whatever the kernel does.  For example, if user space
writes to any file systems mounted in the suspended image, then
you'll get corruption no matter what the kernel does.

This module is not meant to be loaded directly by users.  It's only
meant to be used by system initrd scripts.
