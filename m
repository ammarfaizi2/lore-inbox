Right.

Q: It hangs when booting! Just get to see the cute penguin
   (whatshisnameagain?)

A: What version of Linux? What exactly did the bird do before hanging? BTW,
   his (her?) name is Tux

Q: Oh, yo mean like $BIG_DISTRO 10.7.3? Yep, Tux winked.

A. No, the kernel version... [longish explanation deleted]. And exactly how
   many times did he wink? Which wings? Did he waddle about? How many
   steps? Did he blink? Did you install wink-blink-boot version 27.3, or
   are you still with the older one?

[ad nauseam]

No, thanks. I'd had enough with Aunt Tillie and her family.
