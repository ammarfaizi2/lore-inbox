I've been thinking that a "patches@kernel.org" dumping ground would be
useful.

This is NOT intended as a patch tracker.  This is NOT intended as a
substitution for submitting the patch to you, but instead intended
as a patch archive that doesn't go away.  We have seen linux-kernel
archives come and go, or drop messages.  But a patch archive would be
useful...  I'm not sure a mailing list proper is right for the job,
since I want to support the reception and archiving of multi-megabyte
patches at times.
