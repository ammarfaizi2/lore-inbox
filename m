Lets have some fun now and play this game.

As principle author of the "taskfile transport", any an all operations
using, storing, execution, transfering, copying, opening ... anything 
may not operate with non-source-published binary modules.

So everyone one with/sells a PVR, NAS, SAN, Laptop, Workstation, Server
which uses IDE/ATA/SATA is forbidden to operate unless written terms of
use are set forward.

We can kill Linux in minutes, shall we?
