Yup, that's Scooter (all the Sun old timers call him Scooter, I dunno where
it came from, I wasn't enough of an old timer).  And, yeah, he does a lot 
of marketing.  But in many respects, he's the perfect CEO.  He's always
out in public, pushing the message, and he tends to leave the day to day
stuff to the other folks.  I'll take him over Gates any day of the week.

Scott's only big sin was to dump SunOS for Slowaris.
