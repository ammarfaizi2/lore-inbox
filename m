Wasn't Dijkstra one of the guys behind Algol 68? Yes, the one where some  
Geek test asks if you've read the revised report? ... and did you  
understand it? (I did, even found a bug in the library chapter (a simple  
case of exporting a pointer to local storage), but boy was that the  
hardest-to-understand language definition I've ever seen! Did complete  
symbol definition-and-usage checks purely in the (context-dependant  
meta-)grammar.)
