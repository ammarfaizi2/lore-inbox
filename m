Hi,

Wanted to try out 2.6.0-test1-mm1 but no luck.

The kernel doesn't boot. Right after saying "Ok, booting kernel..."
it hangs and only hardware reset helps at this point. And yes, I have
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE. When vesafb was compiled in it seemed to switch
screen resolution before hang (vga=791).

2.4 boots like a charm.

It's a KT133A motherboard with 1GB of RAM and 1200MHz AMD CPU.

I'll attach my .config.

Any help is appreciated.

Lenar
