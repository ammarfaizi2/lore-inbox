   Thanks.

It is very ontopic because it affects a number of kernel developers.

Whether you like BK or not, it is the primary source management tool
used by Linus and others, it is even documented in the source tree as
such.

Therefore, such a license change could change that, so it's a relavant
topic.

And finally, as the person who has to maintain this list and deal with
the daily bounce pool this list generates every day, I declare it as
ontopic so :-P~~~~~~
