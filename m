I'm a big fan of doing a given merge ONLY ONE TIME rather than every time
there's a contextual diff.  Man, that is definitely something worth being
grateful for.  Especially with the number of changes that come down in the
linux tree.

Rik, care to form the "useful tools that don't screw me over every time I
try to use them" fan club?  I'll chuck in a pair of vice-grips and bk as
the first nominees.

} The development speed and code quality of -rmap have also gone
} up as a consequence of moving over to bitkeeper.
} 
} Merging patches up to a new version of the kernel has gone from
} tiring (with patch and vi) to almost relaxing (with bitkeeper's
} automatic and graphical 2-way merge tools)...
} 
} This in turn has allowed me to spend my time and energy on
} improving the code, without having to fear large patches and
} the maintenance those require.
