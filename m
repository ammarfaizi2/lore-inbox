I'd suggest that you get a clue about what you're talking about before 
spouting off nonsense. The license code in the kernel doesn't prohibit 
anything, it simply provides a means of determining if the kernel is 
running closed code and thus out of the scope of the kernel maintainers.

Frankly, any comparison of SOFTWARE to the horrific evil of the Nazi 
party is an abomination. For that alone, you really don't earn the price 
of admission to anything involving a brain. I can't begin to fathom the 
thought processes of an individual who would belittle the suffering, 
pain, and sacrifices of those who experience that time period with such 
a comparison.

I'm sure you're proud.

John
