Hello !

Had yet this problem in the past but by then solved by having Reiserfs as part 
of the kernel and not as a module.

This time, reiserfs is within the kernel and idicating the RAM dims upon boot 
doesn't help.

I see very often this problem on other mailing lists, also in SuSE's support 
database. Nevertheless, beyound the mentionned solutions, nothing.

Has someone another tip ?

Tks Rgds
