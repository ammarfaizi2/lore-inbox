So I've been reading the email coming in and I see that there
are some issues WRT IDE that Alan seems to be handling, but I'm
curious to see if there are any other issues.

Anyone care to follow up with status reports?  I'm running it
now with no apparent bad-things noticed, but then again I don't
need to know how many blocks my hard drives have :)
