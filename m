I'd say a card with open source drivers and access to detailed
documentation from a company that's willing to work with the Open Source
Software community is a very big first step, and a massive improvement on
the current state of affairs. If we could just get that as a start, then I
for one would be thrilled.

I know very little about graphics card hardware so I have no idea if this 
is interresting or not, but in case you haven't heard of Manticore I 
thought I'd provide a link : http://icculus.org/manticore/
