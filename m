The reason some people use hardware RNGs in the first place is because
they don't trust the software RNGs.  When the hardware RNG fails but
continues to send data to /dev/random, /dev/random essentially degenerates
into a software RNG.  Now granted /dev/random is a pretty good software
RNG, however, for some purposes it just isn't good enough.

Otherwise we can just do away with it and always use /dev/urandom.

Someone else raised the example of Casinos using hardware RNGs.  Some
of them are doing this to comply with government regulation.  In that
case, using data from the software RNG when the hardware has failed
would be violating the law.

That's we have things like RAID and backups.
