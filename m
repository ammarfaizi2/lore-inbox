Hans - 
Here's a thought to chew on.  I _value_ your software and use it extensively 
(along with other linux software).  Out of necessity I painfully roll my own 
Debian distro/kernel and flinch _every_ time I use apt to update my boxes 
(wondering if some damn PAM module is going to hose me).  Anyway, the point 
is, I build video servers that I sell for a profit - it is how I make my 
living.  I am also aware that in reality I am making a living off of the 
backs of you (ala reiserfs) and others like you.  The reason that I use linux 
is not because its free, but because it takes much less time to develop and 
maintain my video applications under linux than windows,  because I can 
remotely service and maintain the boxes that I sell, and because linux has 
proven to be more reliable than the windows os that I used to base my product 
on.  You see, the price is not the issue, its features, performance, and 
reliability are.  So, consider this:  YOU roll a DEB-REISER distribution 
targeted toward system builders such as me, that more smoothly incorporates 
reisefs than does the woody cd's (and a lot less generic), and then support 
the reiser-related issues, and I will happily pay you $100  per machine. It 
is well worth it to me to keep you in business (not that my volume alone 
would do it, but I am sure that there are a lot of others like me).  Don't 
worry about putting in a licensing agent - honesty really works here.  I used 
to base my product on RedHat and I purchased a copy of the OS for every box I 
sold - not that a customer would ever look under the hood or even read the 
docs, but it was my way of supporting the suppliers.  I don't use RedHat now 
because I can't keep up with their release-to-release changes, and I need a 
distro more turned toward enterprise servers.  The point is, I am not alone.

Just a thought.

Joe
