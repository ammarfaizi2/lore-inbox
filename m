Well, this is from their web page:

"The $20 USD subscription fee includes unlimited priority support,
full access to the Sveasoft forums, and unlimited access to new
firmware versions and upgrades."

So it looks like "if you exersize your right for the software in quesion
I terminate the contract we have entered into" as opposed to "I will not
extend your contract beyond initial term".

Isn't that an additional restriction? My rights for updates are revoked
if I distribute GPLed code.
