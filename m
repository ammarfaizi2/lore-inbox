Subject: Status of ALi MAGiK 1 support in 2.4.?

What is the status of the support for this chipset, found for example in an
ASUS A7A266? Judging from
             http://www.acerlabs.com/eng/support/faqlnx.htm
one gets the impression that ALi is respectfully treating the Linux community.

Although VIA is the most popular chipset vendor, its reaction on the recently
Southbridge 686 bugs (and even more recently the Northbridge bug with Athlon
C) and the pirq routing problem in Linux rather disqualify it.

So it seems that only AMD and ALi are left with Socket A chipsets (SiS 735 is
yet to come). And the ALi MAGiK 1 has a good feature/cost ratio and is being
reported as very stable (although perhaps not very fast).

So having been burned in the recent past with VIAs KT133A/686B and Linux, I
hope that I can get an ALi MAGiK 1 board and rest in peace ...

Thanks, Axel.
