} When will the powerpc tree be merged ?  Neither the
} official 2.4 nor the -ac8 work. They don't even compile.

Grab a tree from www.fsmlabs.com/linuxppcbk.html.  Those always compile and
are up-to-date.

I send patches, but they don't always make it into the main tree.  In the
mean time, you have a consistent source of kernels with the above web site.
