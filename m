I added this item on my kernel 2.5 status list a few weeks ago, and 
it seems to be _the_ hot topic for 2.5.

o Pending   Finalize new device naming convention    (Linus Torvalds)

What exactly are people expecting Linus to decide on?  And once it 
has been decided, what is the next step after that?

I really don't want to start a flame war on the subject (so please
refrain from rants), I am just trying to understand what people are 
waiting for. 

Anyone care to explain?  Thanks,

-- Guillaume
