OK, I've fixed some bugs and added a guest account to my new bug
database:

http://grabjohn.com/kernelbugdatabase/

Username: guest
Password: guest

You can't submit bug reports or add comments using the guest account,
(it will appear to let you, but then just not add the data), but you
can search, and try out the command line interface.

If you want a real account, drop me an E-Mail.

John.
