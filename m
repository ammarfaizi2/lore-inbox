Amen.  This whole "CML1 vs CML2" thing is silly.  We don't see other
"maintainers" refusing to touch code, having no relation to code, and
then coming out of no-where and offering some external solution for the
perceived problem.

If you _develop_ kernel code and see a problem with the configure
system, then fix the problems.  As Linus says, let stuff evolve.

Agreed, but CML2 has a whole bunch of new "features" too which will be
shoved down our throats!!
