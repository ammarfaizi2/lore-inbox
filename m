I have the same effect when booting from windows98 to linux ( 2.4.3 up to 
2.4.5). The windowsdriver less the card in a unbalanced state so that the card
lost his information of there own mac adress. We must plug off the powercable,
after plugin an start into linux the dlink card works. I don´t know what kinds
of specific instruction in the windows driver, but when I only used this cards
under linux, I doesn´t have this problem.
