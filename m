Hi Alan!

Sure, but what I wanted to know are there some documents that describe
the changes between 2.2 and 2.4? And how would you accept patches?

For sure I could only make it work - maybe with help by Steven
Walter - and then provide a patch for the whole thing. I know you and
Linus only want small patches. I think this will only relate to the
ftape drive, so I ask would the aformentioned big patch do? Or how'd
we split it up?

Maybe you could take a quick look at the latest state of the
driver (dont forget to count the small patch of Steven Walter)
and tell me what you think about the whole thing.
