Actually, no...  I'd like to see the OS equivalent of a GPU...  We know 
what the problems of an OS are now...  they have not changed for 25 
years...  and in those 25 years we have gathered an enormous library of 
lessons learned...

Let's learn from what we already know and take a step above push/pop/mov 
(ok a leap) and stop working around what is now basically 30 years of 
crap piled on the 8086 and create some hardware that is actually 
"Specific to the Application" rather than the other way around...

ps. I am doing my part to kill this thread - "just say no"  ;-)
