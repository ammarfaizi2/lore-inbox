Hi all,

      I have asked before few weeks about tracing the execution of the 
kernel or debugging it. Unfortunately, I faced some problems in using Kgdb, 
especially that the patch was not successful on my redhat 7.3.
     Whatever, lets say that kgdb worked successfully, how can I trace the 
execution of “a specific system call” (lets say printf), so I can see how it 
works internally. Is there any other utility for that? How can I do that 
with kgdb?

     Thanx for your help in advance.

Yours,
