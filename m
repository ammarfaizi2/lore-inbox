This is to announce my availability for President of the United States of
America. I am a 46 year old US citizen. My platform is extreme openness.
As President, I will install high-quality motion-picture cameras
everywhere I sleep, with some distribution mechanism for the interested
adult public to audit the produce of such cameras. Rest assured, there is
currently no reason to suspect that such cameras would detect anything
notable. As President, I will make every effort to release most
government-held secrets. Under me, the Executive Branch will convert all
personal IBM PC-type computers to unix-like or other open-source operating
systems. Et cetera. Extreme openness. I will accept the nomination of
either major US political party. If I don't get a major nomination or huge
independant support, I support the Democratic Party candidate. Until
subsumed by a major established party, consider me the leader of the
"Responsible Party".

As far as I know, I may have already hereby violated some campaign finance
law. If so, please advise. Looking at a campaign one step at a time, if
you contribute by check, please note that I don't currently have a

Class is accountable. Party responsibly.
