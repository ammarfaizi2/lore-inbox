I chose not to read, I read the license.

Here's the thing. When you say "This is GPL code", you kind of have
to ship GPLd code. I realise this is difficult for the hard of thinking,
but getting creative with MODULE_LICENSE strings isn't good enough.

No Richard, I'm just respectful of the licenses of code that comes my way.
If you were a "real engineer", perhaps you would do the same.

to reply, I don't expect you to achieve enlightenment any time soon.
