		in this place is lack "also" word which seems can change
meaning all this kind discution to level acceptable by every your
respondents.

In this level some words like Linux, BSD, GNU have some double meaning and
also on this level phrases like "GNU/Linux" always will looks like kind of

will allow you (also) stop this kind stupid discutions.
