Andrea, be honest.

This latest thing didn't start with just the signature. In fact, the 
signature flame-war I berated Larry for - ask Larry. I told him he 
shouldn't let himself be goaded.

This one started with you very much making the whole point of your whole
post be a complaint about the license:

  "if Marcelo would be using open source code to exports the patchsets in
   his tree, we could fix it to add the email address along the name in the
   checkin logs metadata, to avoid this sort of mistakes."

That quote is not just some small snippet: it is the _entirety_ of new 
material in the whole post. 

You are whining. You did nothing _but_ whine in the post. About other 
peoples choice of license usage.

 (a) It wasn't all you said
 (b) I can, and do, get offended by postings to public non-religious lists
     that have no redeeming value except to push your religious views.

I despise people who come up to me in the street (or even worse - ring the
doorbell on my house) to tell me about Jesus, and how they found happiness
in him.

Good for you and your buddy Jesus/buddha/Moses/AlienFromAnotherPlanet. But
get the _hell_ out of my face. If I come to your church to listen to your
sermons, that's when I'll respect your right to tell me.  But if you stand
up with a megaphone in the park when I'm having a picknick, I'd much
rather kick your sorry ass the h*ll out of there.

So go to gnu.misc.discuss if you want to discuss the immorality of 
licenses. There you'll find people who care. linux-kernel is about 
technical discussions about the kernel, and yes IT IS OFFENSIVE to push 
religion here.

It's also offensive to have comments about abortion or guns in your 
signature. For exactly the same reason (and btw, I complained to esr when 
he had his gun-control signature, so I'm not just making these up).

Do you see?

Now can we get back to complaining about the scheduler behaviour and xmms?

Please?
