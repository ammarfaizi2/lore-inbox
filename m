>> [GPL acknowledging fair-use rights]

> Pure noise, a license can't take them away in any case.

A bare license probably cannot take them away, since you haven't
agreed to anything.  But (1) that may not be true in all legal
systems, and (2) a contract-based license can take it away (e.g. an
NDA).  So the GPL's clarification is worthwhile.  For the same reason,
I'm guessing, the Creative Commons licenses have (also in section 2,
at least in v2.5):

   2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or
   other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner
   under copyright law or other applicable laws.
