i am not suscribed to this list so please cc the comments and replies to vivek_ramachandran@rediffmailcom  


i have an amd k6-2(?) processor.i compiled the latest 2.4.4 kernel with cpu ak k6-2.i got the following error
"loading linux............
 uncompressing linux......
 ok,booting kernel"
and the system hangs.
i understand from the archives that this means the cpu id is wrong.is there any other reason for this.
i tried another experiment
i compiled the kernel for cyrix3 and i am able to boot normally.
i know that the cpu is marked amd as i assembled it myself.
any help will be appreciated 
                                             vivek.r
