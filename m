I do not count GPL programs on top of a proprietary bios because the bios is firmware AND NOT TECHNICALLY SOFTWARE.

Which is all nice and good, but trying to do this in order to suspend a

After all, the vendor gave you the code with the hardware in this case, so 
it's not as if you can possibly not have a license for it :-)
