Hey

The "dynsched" project aims switching the CPU scheduler at runtime. Its
based upon the "plugsched" patch by Peter Williams
(http://cpuse.sourceforge.net/). Increments to plugsched especially
a kthread, wich switchs between different schedulers, in sched.c and a
proc user interface. 

Following scheduler implementations are currently supported:
* ingosched
* nicksched
* staircase

There are some missing functions like converting task_struct between the
schedulers. First tests by Christian Ege on kernel 2.6.13.5 and 2.6.13.4
were successful. The spa based schedulers (such as spa_no_frills, zaphod
etc) are not yet supported. I hope they will be finished soon, just as
SMP support.

There is an alpha patch available at project site -
https://sourceforge.net/projects/dynsched
 
Using the procfs you can switch between the linux standard scheduler
(ingosched), nicksched and staircase schedulers by simply issuing: 
echo "name_of_the_scheduler" > /proc/dynsched

The dynsched project started as a part of our computer science study at
the university of applied sciences Konstanz. I hope it doesn't end with
our graduation. Thanks to Prof. Dr. Michael MÃ¤chtel, Peter Williams, who
provided us with helpful informations. The following people are
currently working with me on the dynsched project: Christian Ege, Dieter
Kling, Christian Binkert and Mathias Bucher.
