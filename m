Results from a bunch of recent runs, with comparison graphs are here:
http://developer.osdl.org/cliffw/reaim/index.html

At the moment, nothing exciting to report. ( so no numbers in this email)
 The -mm series are
testing very close to the mainline, differences right now are
not statistically significant. See the Web page for more.

Will be testing different file systems next, to see if we can find some deltas
