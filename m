dear all

I would like to know which kind people turn the mailing list into a
newsgroup ?

this would enable me to read at my leisure and not have my inbox overflow.
I am connected to NTL (UK) the same as I believe Mr. A Cox, but I can not
find a working newsgroup the NTL administrator has asked me for details and
I am afraid I don't know (hence this mail).

can someone give me some advice ?

regards

john jones

p.s. I am not subscribed to the list so can you CC me or the list whichever
is appropriate 

p.p.s. I am interested in other lists such as linux-mips and not just the
core linux M.L.
