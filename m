   Will you babysit them, check whether later snapshots correct this
   flaw, resubmit your report every month if not?  Maybe you will. I
   certainly don't - send the report and that's it.

And like evolution and many other processes in life, the things
that put forth the effort will tend to get further and accomplish
more.

As a result, your bug reports will tend to not be tended to,
whilst those of the persistent people will.  People who care
about their bug reports learn the become persistent or accept
that their bugs tend to not get looked at.

People who expect that, for free, one bug submission will get
their bug fixed and this is somehow ensured are truly living
in a dream world.

Let's see, what makes more sense from my perspective.  Should I reward
and put forth effort for the people who fart a bug report onto the
lists and expect everyone to stop what they're doing and fix the bug,
or should I reward and put forth effort for the guy who spent the time
to put together a stellar bug report and also doesn't mind
retransmitting it from time to time whilst everyone is busy?
