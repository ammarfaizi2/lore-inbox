Subject: Create a message board?

Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Would a message board based forum help to alleviate some of the mailing list 
traffic by keeping information exchanges thread local (no pun intended)?  
This way the developers specializing in a certain portion of the kernel 
aren't swamped with information about something totally irrelevant, thus 
they can focus on what they know.  Example:  File system programmers getting 
messages relating to sound cards.

I am interested in any feedback on this idea.
