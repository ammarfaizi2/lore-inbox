Hi,

I have a dec alpha 300 with a scsi disk which is doing nothing 100% of
the time. Actually; nothing usefull, apart from the seti@home process :o)
I like to do a continues stress-test of the ext3 filesystem which aborts
when something fails. Am I helping anyone with that? In that case: what
application should I install to make it an usefull excercise?

mvg,
fvh.
