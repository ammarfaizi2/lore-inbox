I should point out that some of the features specified have already been
submitted as patchsets.  Some were accepted and are in 2.6.  Some were
rejected, and we are considering the feedback received...  (But, we're
still hopeful that in the long run, we can make certain things
acceptable for inclusion in the mainline tree.)

The submissions, so far, have come from member companies or individuals
rather than from the forum itself.
