I was using 2.6.0-test11 on a gentoo install on this system and my 
system worked fine, however that install died earlier this week, and now 
i'm running debian.  The configuration in gentoo didn't boot for debian 
so i reset everything from scratch.

Now when i boot it takes an excessively long time to set up the 
harddrives, and produces the following errors:

I know (from the gentoo install the kernel has no real issues with my 
hardware) so i was wondering if someone could point to a possible config 
option that might be causing this?

I've included my kernel config.

I have the nvidia modules installed, however it had this delay before 
the nvidia modules were recompiled. 

Any help would be appreciated :)

PS Anyone running debian out there had issues getting GLX modules 
incorporated into X?
