I think the developers have a moral responsibility to make an attempt to
at least answer questions and bug reports.  Even if the answer is just:
I'm too busy now...please check back later.

If you don't have time to respond for a protracted time, then it's time
to give up stewardship of the project to someone who has more resources
available....

I am just as guilty of being slow to answer as most other folks, so this
is not to cast blame.  I do think your crass assumption that developers
owe nothing to the users of their code is quite wrong though.
