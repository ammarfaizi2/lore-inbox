I'll throw this back out again, and if you all are not interested, drop it
if you want.  I am looking for places and points to help out where I see
issues come up several times, and this is one I have seen occasionally. I am
not advocating Eric's proposal for sweeping maintainer's changes, though I
respect Eric, and all the developers work.  How about starting with a simple
MAINTAINERS file maintainer?  Someone to actively follow project developers
and contact info?  Not a small or simple project, I understand, but maybe a
central point to send patches to Linus for the Maintainers file?  Just my
two cents, on a Tuesday  :o)
