Hi, Oliver.

You seemed to answer my e-mail without reading it; what I was explaining 
in it was: this is not a matter of patches, but of asking Where are the 
copyrights notices, Who are the copyright owners, and Which license are 
the firmwares under, and AFTER that, patching what should be patched.

Those three questions (Where, Who, Which) can only be answered by the 
kernel maintainers, and this is in *NO* way a Debian-only discussion. As 
I mentioned before, kernel.org kernel tree is, as of today, non-free and 
undistributable IMHO.

HTH,
Massa
