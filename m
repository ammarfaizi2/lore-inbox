All that aside it has been said that profanity is the effort of a
weak mind to express itself. Of course, I've demonstrated my own
weak mind from time to time. I just try to avoid having it
immortalized on the web somewhere. Imagine an prospective employer

help one acquire the jobs that allow us to continue this playing.
