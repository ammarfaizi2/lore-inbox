I didnt find "Understanding Linux kernel" (as far as I could read) comparable to the BSD counterpart of Kirk McKusick's book of "Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD OS". It would be great is Linus or someone attached to the birth of Linux could write a book starting from the infancy of Linux, design decisions made, the current architecture, etc. Just a thought ;

I highly recommend "Understanding the Linux Kernel" by Bovet and Cesati, 
and published by O'Reilly. I believe there is a second edition now, and 
I found it quite useful.

You might also consider http://kernelnewbies.org/.

Good luck.
