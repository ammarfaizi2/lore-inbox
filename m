Not really. You're trying to find excuses for adding limitations.

5. Let's not put in artificial limitations on what people can and can't
do with their hardware. Let them use floppydisks if they want to. Let
them use CDs if they want to. Let them use 2+ CDs if they want to. Let
them use DVDs if they want to. Let them use Zip disks, LS-120 disks etc
if they want to so long as they are supportable.

If we can support it, we should.

Afterall, the main reason *I* use linux is that it lets me do what I
want to. And I want to use floppy disks for my rescue needs. If and when
I need more I'll move on but the floppy disk is a common denominator
across millions of PCs. Far more then any other removable storage system
I'd say (ofcourse I have no figures to back that up - just common sense).
