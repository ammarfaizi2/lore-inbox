One thing Linus doesn't realize is that the most successfull
results of the biological selection are not the high mamals but
simle archaic bacterias. This is the point where his
analogy breaks badly.

One one thing he simple appears to have forgotten: Operating 
systems have a *purpose*. Therefore the stuff one wan't to do with
a system is what is driving it's true developement - this is most
pertinent in the developement of a driver - one does it to
use some kind of hardware it's that simple.

However I agree with him fully that most of the so called 
software engineering methods do not have much in common with
the reality out there and are basically a self exercise.
