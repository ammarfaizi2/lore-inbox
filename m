So - did you ever start that FAQ??  :)

I'm trying to get a dual Vectra XU 5/90 up and running right now.

I found it on the street, spent about $3 for a second processor, and
I bought some RAM for it.  I can install DOS and whatnot, so I know
it works, but I run a Unix-only shop in my house..  :)


Thanks in advance for any tips you might have.
  

Dave
