Roman, Larry has a perfectly valid reason to call you a jerk, because 
you are being one, and have been one for at least 50% of your posts 
on this list over the last 2 years or more.  Right this instant my 
most fervent wish is for you to go get a job at M$ or something, and 
leave us the hell alone.  Either put up the $$ for Larry to take time 
from other profitable endeavors and do it, or STFU.

Jon, the only way I'd contribute a tenner to match your is if somebody 
held it in escrow till the job is done.
