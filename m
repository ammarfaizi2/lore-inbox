[1.] One line summary of the problem:

IDE UDMA read hangs system hard (VIA 586a)

[2.] Full description of the problem/report:

IDE UDMA transfer from Maxtor UDMA66 drive (MB is only UDMA33) hangs machine
hard. Funny thing is that writing with "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdb" don't
hang the system but reading from the drive does. Turning DMA off with hdparm
cures the problem but turns performance very slow.
I also tried putting Maxtor as secondary master and CDRW as slave, but same
hang happened.
Earlier this year I used without problem (DMA worked with both drives) same
motherboard and master drive but slave Maxtor was newer 40GB D540x UDMA133
model. Kernel was newest available 2.4.20(pre) at the time.

[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):

IDE, VIA, DMA, hang, Maxtor

[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):

Linux version 2.4.22-pre5 (root) (gcc version 3.3.1 20030626 (Debian
prerelease))
(same problem was with vanilla 2.4.21 kernel too)
(I also tried with GCC-3.2.3, same problem too)
