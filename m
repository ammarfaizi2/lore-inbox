I have exactly the same problem here, but I'm  using a  S3 ProSavage (Twister) 
card, and kernel 2.5.67. The cursor seems to get some pixels "corrupted".

The bug exists since 2.5.66 and it worked perfectly for 2.5.65 and earlier at 
least for me. If you require any details please let me know. I'll try to 
provide all the data that you need (but let me know how to, since I'm a 
complete newbie. No kidding ;-)

(Please CC me out of the list for any reply, since I'm not suscribed to this 
list.)

Thanks,

	Unai
