I, in my egocentrism, think it would make more sense to have a deadline 
for submission rather than a deadline for acceptance, as that would make 
things predictable for patch submitters, and avoid unintentional 
overlooking of good patches from obscure persons due to the crush of 
patches in October.

Pre-announcing the deadline is good, but having it be a deadline on 
something the patch submitters control (submission time not acceptance 
time) would be even better.
