hello,

i know that the 2.0.3.7 driver for the this card works...
but i have 2.4.7...i know the structure of driver code
changed some. can anyone help rewriting the 2.0.3.7
driver to work with 2.4.7....the >2.0.3.7 has been reported
not working, but my success at finding useful
info ends there...

it just hangs...can anyone help? i am not very
knowledgeable of the scsi driver code ;-(
