Oh, come on now...  You're being too logical and level headed.
If everyone were like you, suddenly the volume of l-k would drop
by half, we wouldn't be wasting thousands of Linux developer-hours,
and we might actually get some coding done.

Please don't try this again.  Go back and read any one of the dozens
of lengthy flame wars on l-k for more appropriate methods of not
solving an unsolvable problem.

Cheers, Andreas
