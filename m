(sigh.) So you want me to change the way I (and other people) work 
so.... Why was it again?  So we can block the one message in 1000 
that contains a Windows virus and was sent from Outlook?  

and, incidentally, block bug reports and other potentially useful 
mail and valid help requests from people who may not be subscribed, 
may be having difficulty installing Linux... 

And you think that's better than just blocking the viruses, or 
binary attachments in general, or something else more rational?

Please.

Torrey
