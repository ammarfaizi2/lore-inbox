Yeah.  I'm using the Linux VM.  And it _still_ isn't up to what I managed
to accomplish in SunOS.  Wake up, dude.  You aren't the first one to
work in this area, you are just one of the first to work in this area
without learning from the people who came before you.  Don't believe me?
Go to OLS and read the papers.  Then read the OS research that has
happened in the last 20 years or so.  So far you are still catching up.
