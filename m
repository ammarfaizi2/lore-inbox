This note is to announce creation of a single-topic
mailing list on common device naming.

As LSB project lead, I've been asked about specifying
Linux device naming in the LSB.  We're not set up to do
that; the LSB can only specify what is already "best
practice".  

A number of people think that getting this right in
the new world of userspace device naming (e.g. udev)
is important enough that they'd like to get together
and try to achieve common ground between those
shipping distributions with the 2.6 kernel.

Having a common device naming policy would be a nice
thing for certain classes of applications. Once developed 
and adopted,  this policy could be a candidate for
inclusion in the LSB or the FHS.

If you consider yourself a stakeholder in this, please 
join the list device_naming@lists.osdl.org at:
