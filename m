Dear Friend,

My name is Paul Campbell, a senior staff and executive of 
a 
bank I have only written to seek your indulgence and assistance.

I 
wish to make a transfer involving a huge amount.

I am proposing to 
make this transfer to a designated bank 
account of your choice.Thus,  
for your indulgence and support, I 
propose an offer of 25% of the 
total amount to be yours after the 
transfer has been successfully 
concluded.

Kindly reply me stating your interest, and I shall furnish 
you with the details and necessary proceedure with which to make the 
transfer.

I anxiously await your response.

Thanks and Godbless.

Sincerely yours,

PAUL
