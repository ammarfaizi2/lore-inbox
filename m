How exactly would you do this specifically for "downloaded" files except
by snooping into every ftp/http, much less having to decrypt the
protocols like https or scp?

Anyway, assuming you meant "downloaded file == any file", that's simple,
and already being discussed, most likely by companies like TiVo, etc.
