If this was a business, and we were knowingly distributing software
that was known to be dangerous, we would probably be risking legal
action.

Why are we distributing such severely broken software? Heck, we seem
reluctant to include reiserfs, a pretty high quality, supported file
system. And we continue to distribute this !@#$%... There must be some
strange agenda going on to limit the use of Linux.
