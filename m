Hi!

Strange thing happened: My machine appeared to lock up. I tried to
switch consoles, and nothing happened.... Up to now. Now I see
consoles redrawing on vesab, at speed around 5 characters per
second. [Yes, I can see letters being erased].

That's little slow for 300MHz celeron... I hope.

[Just before "incident", I turned of sharp zaurus; maybe it was
connected using usbnet and now uhci is eating all the bandwidht?
Anyone seen this before?]
