The system is a i430VX-based pentium-classic, with an intel USB1.1 controller
onboard and a VIA 1xUSB2.0/2xUSB1.1 controller board plugged into PCI.

The chip does have "vt6202" written on it, 
"VIA VT6202-2 REV A" on the PCB. 
The kernel is test11.
All of the power management is turned off both in kernel config and BIOS.
No USB devices are attached to the host controller at the boot time.

There are different patterns achieved by plugging/unplugging the VIA controller
and turning on/off various IRQ-consuming devices in BIOS (like serial/parallel
ports, onboard IDE, floppy controller, onboard intel USB etc.)

	- when the VIA controller is unplugged, everyone is happy, (even the
		intel USB controller detects cleanly)
	- when the VIA controller is plugged, sometimes the kernel hangs
		during the initialisation of one of the VIA`s USB1.1`s
		(sometime the first one, sometimes the last, depending on
		the irq usage map)
	- when the VIA controller is plugged, sometimes the kernel doesn`t
		hang during init, but spits out tons of error messages
		instead. (NOTE: it dosn`t depend on the intel USB being
		turned on, except its IRQ variance addition)
