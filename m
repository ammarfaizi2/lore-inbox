That confirms my guess, but unfortunately, the only remaining 0.99.13
kernels are 0.99.13 itself and 0.99.13k - I've never managed to track
down any of the other members of that series.

Likewise, 0.99.12 and 0.99.12a exist, then there's a big time gap to
0.99.13 with nothing in between still existing as far as I can
determine.

Best wishes from Riley.
