define router... do you mean an ap with nat... or do you meant an actaul
router but with wireless interfaces... 

consumer wireless ap's are dreadfully tight on flash and ram. there are
inexpensive embeded pc platforms that are far more appropriate for 
consumer wireless development platforms than an accesspoint you buy for 
$70 at frys... microtik or soekris boxes come to mind almost immediatly 
and there are others. 

We have embeded machines built on such platforms doing various tasks 
running freebsd and modern linux distros that cost order of $250-400ea
