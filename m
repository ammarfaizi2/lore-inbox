The "consensus" seems to be: The kernel is currently GPLv2 (and nothing
else) and changing that is almost an imposible task, and the majority of
the major active contributers also don't seem interested in considering
the GPLv3 in its current form.  It really seems to be that simple.

Some people claim Novell's "Deal" isn't even permitted under the GPLv2,
or that the "Deal" has no meaning or purpose at all.
