There is no case law in Germany. Case law is somethig that is only used 
in England and the USA.

In Germany there are laws for _everything_. Rules like who owns the
swarm of bees when several swarms of bees unite aren't made at court,
they are explicitely written in laws.

German judges don't read 200 years old judicial decisions, they read 
written laws.

Please ask a lawyer about the differences between the English/US and the 
continental Europe law system if you don't believe me.

The current German copyright law doesn't talk about money. If you allow 
someone to use a copy the law explicitely states that some kind of 
contract clauses (e.g. a complete prohibition of disassembling) are 
simply void.
