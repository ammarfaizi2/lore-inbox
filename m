Sorry for the spam, but this petition has a time limit on it. It is a 
petition only for UK citizens and UK residents to the PM. The PM has 
actually acted on some of these petitions in the past, whether he will 
move on this one is another matter. If you feel that software patents 
are bad and you are a UK citizen or UK resident then go to this link and 
please sign.
