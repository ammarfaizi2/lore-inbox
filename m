Subject: BTTV problems in 2.4.3

I'm having some bttv problems in 2.4.3 (2.4.2 works fine). When my xawtv
window (or my fbtv resolution) gets to a certain point (like 768x576, which
is what I want, 640x480 is still fine) the right part of the tv window is
left black. I'm back to using 2.4.2 again, but I could produce a screenshot
if you want me to. We're not talking some small bar being left black, but
rather a small bar on the left showing 20-25% of the tv picture.

P.S. Please CC to me, I'm not on the list

Robert
