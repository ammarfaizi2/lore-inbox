	Funny you should mention SanDisk.  Maybe the newer ones have gotten
better but the CF cards I used in my PDA were mixes of the SanDisk 128
Meg and SimpleTech 128 Meg.  Burned up several before I realized it was
the nightly backup program that was eating them and I didn't notice any
difference between the brands.  I don't know what controller was in the
SimpleTech CF cards.  Any way to tell short of dismantling them?
