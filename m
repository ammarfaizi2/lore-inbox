You can't allocate 2049 bytes for a partition - it is always a
whole number of 512-byte blocks.

ext2/ext3 uses either 1024-byte bï¿½locks or 4096-byte blocks.
(well, you may be able to use 2048-byte blocks, or
8192-byte blocks on systems with 8k pages, but thats another issue.)

Just make sure your partition is a whole number of blocks, ext2/ext3 should
then be able to utilize the partition fully to the last block.

Using a blocksize equal to the pagesize (i.e. 4096) is usually optimal.
1024-byte blocks may be useful if your filesystem is dominated
by files smaller than 2K, otherwise don't bother.

So make sure your partition consist of an integral number of 4k blocks,
it will then be perfect.
