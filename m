This is a general problem with almost all the existing entries, and
will have to await a future editing pass for solution.  For now I think
it's more important to have consistent cues that users can recognize,
even if they're not literally appropriate.

It is the assumption of this book that a work of art is a gift, not a
commodity.  Or, to state the modern case with more precision, that works of
art exist simultaneously in two "economies," a market economy and a gift
economy.  Only one of these is essential, however: a work of art can survive
without the market, but where there is no gift there is no art.
