Not to sound dense, but what part of the GPL prohibits a piece of GPL'd
software from including non-GPL'd code? The GPL does explicitly state
that you can't include it's software in proprietary code, but I don't
recall seeing a provision that prohibits the other way around.

It may not be in the "spirit" of the GPL, but as a legal document, the
letter means more than the spirit in the final determination.

Sorry to intrude on this, but the thought just struck me. I could be
wrong in my remembrance.
