That's a real problem (and that's probably why Sun tries to be the
copyright holder in OO)

Maybe the kernel would be wrong place to start, besides the kernel is
already well funded. (It could provoke a demostration or cascading
effect).

Yes, that's clear. It's great. You learn, then you contribute back. But
that doesn't allow you to pay your bills, does it? The thing is massive
amounts of people _don't_ code, never will, are willing to contribute
but don't do it, because they are not beign asked for support in the
right way. You need them to know they'll put $10 and get $100.000.000
worth every year. 

But if OSS finds a better way to fund developement, it certainly won't
hurt your learning experience. It may well improve it (more code, more
research, more accesibility). The point is to allow more people full
dedication to OSS.

PD: Maybe some day we'll find out the perfect solution.
