Before you call Nvidia a "THEIF", look in the mirror and read the legal
license associated with the drivers you have, and you do not have
hardware.

http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?IO=legal_info

The attached EULA is what you forgot to read, or maybe forgot understand.

Well recall you said it was time for you to consult your
"lawyer"/"solicitor", well lets see if I can help you do it faster.
I am tired of your rants about NVIDIA and the commerial viability of
binary library objects with public source wrappers.

With any luck you can be the person to win or loose the case and make GPL
viable or not.

Are you willing to take the risk?
