That is only the "PARTIES", your forgot the "BEER".

"BEER" comes first at the end of disk.  Only after the "BEER" is
located, can one access the "PARTIES".  Since the "PARTIES" first entry
point is after the last sector of "BEER".

Don't forget to drop by EDD's place.

You know, Enhanced Disk Drive Services (EDD) [was EDD 3.0].

We have to look address EDD's requirements to be able to find the location
of "BEER" and handle the future "PARTIES".  Of course, working to support
"EDD"'s "BEER" "PARTIES" in principle should prevent a drive crash........


The documents about which we spoke are at:
