Hello,

I am writing a Linux USB blog in
http://www.livejournal.com/users/usblog.

It reflects an on going research on Linux USB
subsystem.

I posted till now 4 blogs, and I intend to post
about 3 or 4 times a week. It deals with Linux USB layer.
It is not a professional research ,but you might find it interesting.

You are invited to attend this blog; any remarks/comments/thoughts will be
welcomed.

It is In fact taken from http://www.livejournal.com/users/rrx;
http://www.livejournal.com/users/rrx deals with Linux at large,
while http://www.livejournal.com/users/usblog is the part of RRX blog which
deals soleley with Linux USB).

Cheers,
  USBLOG
