What kind of battle? Do you really want to go to court? 
I'm so sorry to spoil your fun, but you don't have any chance to get a case. 
As long as you don't have contributed anything significant to the kernel, 
absolutely none of _your_ rights have been violated. And no, you can't sue on 
behalf of others, who just don't want that.
So start coding or shut up. Oh, and you should hope that Linus still accepts 
patches from you...

cheers,
  Flo
