For this reason, because in many countries the patent is not expired and
that kernel is not _only_ for people of U.S., I think that we have to
change to PNG format rather than gif.

I vote for pass to PNG format as fast as we can.

of the kernel hackers about it; obviously, vote is secret) about this?
