Is anyone besides me getting multiple copies of Jeff Epler's message?  I've
gotten at least a couple of dozen copies of this (and another long message by
Ted T'so with the subject "Re: Serial cardbus code.... for testing, please.....
") since yesterday.  They arrive once or twice an hour, all day long.  Obviously
there's a loop somewhere, but only these two messages seem to be affected.  If
no one else is seeing the duplicates I'll have our local mail admistrators look
at it, but I hate to accuse their software of being the problem without some
indication that it's only happening locally.

NFS, or a local filesystem?
