I've updated the contest benchmark to v0.50

http://contest.kolivas.net

A significant limitation of the benchmark prior to v0.50 was not knowing how 
much work was being done by the background load.  Knowing this information 
would be helpful in interpreting the data presented by contest. I have added 
two more results to each run by contest - an internal number generated by the 
load condition describing how much work was done, and the cpu% of the load 
while running.  Here is a sample of how the information is presented:

noload:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [3]              67.7    98      0       0       1.01

process_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [3]              106.5   59      112     43      1.59

io_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [3]              492.6   14      38      10      7.33

mem_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [3]              100.0   72      33      3       1.49

The "loads" variable presented is an internal number (the absolute value is 
not important) and makes comparisons easier. The LCPU% is the cpu% the load 
used while running. Note if you look for example at process_load the CPU% + 
LCPU% can be >100 because the load runs for longer than the kernel compile. 
However, this has been accounted for in the "loads" result, to take into 
account the variable extra duration the load runs relative to the kernel 
compile.

An updated complete set of benchmarks will be posted in a separate thread for 
clarity.
