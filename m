I'm not sure Eric would have to.

It's entirley possible the problem will solve itself 
when/if people like myself who hang around the edge of 
kernel dev , find their favourite piece of kernel has
no maintainer - and volunteer. 

So Eric solution may get new maintainers to appear for orphaned code
as 'if by magic'

Alternatively not, of course.
