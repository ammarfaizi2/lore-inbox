I feel i should have my opinions voiced here too. First of all, the USA has 
to many weird laws regarding to copyright. As a Canadian myself, i dont feel 
its fair that someone can go to jail for such a long time because of watching 
thier _own_ dvd disk they bought out of thier _own_ money. Its all about 
greed. If thier wasent so much greed from these billionaires, the world would 
be a better place. And seeing them _trying_ to make hardware standard to stop 
copying is even more sick. And them trying to change the laws to the worst by 
using the anti-terrorism bill is enough to make one puke. The RIAA wanted 
rights to literally _hack_ thier way into peoples boxes and delete all of 
thier stolen MP3s. Ive heard this, and i laughed so hard anyone could hear 
me. Now that they didnt get those rights, thier trying to get sound card 
makers to put crap in thier products since they couldnt get the hard disk 
manufacturers to. Will they ever stop? Thier "DRM OS" and "DRM hardware" is 
what they drool over, even tho thiers _ways_ to get by any form of methods. 
And heck, who will buy this kinda crap hardware? And do ya think the rest of 
the world is going to manufacturer such hardware when its only the USA 
whining to get such hardware? Remember the DVD? "Oh, thier never going to 
crack by its encryption."

just my 2 cents,

Brendan
