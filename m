Well, yes, the changelogs are generated by BitKeeper, but what gets fed 
into bitkeeper is controlled by some scripts I wrote, which are the ones 
that take the email and munge it into a readable format etc. So by the 
time the thing hits my BK repository, the email headers will all have been 
thrown away, except for "From: " and "Subject: ". So BK never sees the 
full email.

(Even my scripts don't see the full email a large percentage of the time:  
I end up prettifying the emails for actual application by first removing
things like "Hi Linus, please apply this" etc which are pointless in the 
changelog).
