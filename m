A years ago, having a car engine of about 50 Cv/litre and all though it was the
best.

...now we have some engines like the bmw m3's 3.3 engine of about 103 Cv/litre,
or Honda S2000, 2.0, about 120 Cv/litre, Audi S3 1.8  turbo 122 cv/litre, audii
rs4 twin turbo about 140 cv/litre...

I think that evolution uses to be a good thing ;)
