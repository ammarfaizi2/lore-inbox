    But you don't attach strings about naming in GPL, so you are SOL respect
    FSF owned software.

Please see http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#deserve.

    What is discussed here is the operating system (narrow sense, i.e., kernel
    only) called Linux, on which you have no claim whatsoever.

We all agree that the proper name for the kernel is "Linux."
The disagreement is about the name for the complete system
that people use on desktops and servers.
