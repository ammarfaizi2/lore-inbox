Hi,

I put 2.5 on my router, and now wondershaper doesn't work anymore. Am I
completely out of whack, or shouldn't the below just fly:

router:~ # tc -s qdisc ls dev lo
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
Dump terminated

I have the various QOS stuff enabled (config attached, and I don't seem
to be missing anything. So what is up?
