Huh?  That's like saying "we don't need a bug database, we have a mailing
list".  That's patently wrong and so is your statement.  If you want 
reviews you need some place to store them.  A mailing list isn't storage.

You'll do it however you want of course, but you are being stupid about it.
Why is that?
