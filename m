There's an Adobe SVG plugin that works on Linux (at least on FC3).

<http://download.adobe.com/pub/adobe/magic/svgviewer/linux/3.x/3.01x88/en/adobesvg-3.01x88-linux-i386.tar.gz>

This works fine with a test SVG link at Adobe but after installing it 
Firefox only displays the above link as source :-(

Before I installed the plug in Firefox displayed the above link OK but 
couldn't display the SVG stuff. :-(

Yes, it seems that it needs some work.
