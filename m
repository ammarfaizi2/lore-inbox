Anyone with just a little human sensitivity can see from the postings that 
are available between Greg and Nemosoft that there is a bad karma between 
them and that they could not communicate. And I read Gregs act as very 
arrogant.

Yes. As soon as he found out he removed it. WHY as soon as he was made 
aware of it? After 4 years in the kernel. WHY did he have to remove the 
hook right away before a replacement code was written? WHY was this so 
important? WHY couldn't it wait - maybe a month or two until Nemosoft had 
an alternative way to do it ready? Why was there no open dialog about how 
to get things straight again?
This is the issue. Not weather binary modules should be allowed or not. I 
agree with keeping the kernel GPL. It is the way you did it and again. DO 
YOU CARE ABOUT THE USERS?

Again you avoid the question by hising behind the GPL like a chicken.
Do you care about the 10000s of users?

The hook was there for 4 years. Don't come and say that no kernel 
developers knew that there was a binary module called pwcx.
You can find open discussions about it way back. Maybe Greg personally did 
not know but some of the rest of you knew about pwcx. Some of you even have 
a Logitech 3000 or 4000 camera. Don't play the "We did not know" game here.

And the fact that it has been there for many years simply cannot be argued. 
It has de facto been tolerated for years and 10000s of users depends on it.
It should have been replaced later. Not crippled now. That is the point!!!!

Total Customer Satisfaction is not marketing. It is a matter of treating 
other people in a decent way. It is a matter of being a good citizen.

The kernel does not get better because the pwc driver is crippled here and 
now leaving the users with a problem - instead of being replaced by 
something better in a controlled way.
The kernel does not get better by treating a kernel module contributor in 
an arrogant way by modifying the his code with no real dialog.
The kernel gets better by correcting things in a way that makes it appear 
stable over time and encourage more people to participate. Not by chasing 
them away.

That is the point.
Or in other words.

- Do the changes so that the users are not negatively impacted more than 
necessary. Care about the users!

- Threat the contributors of any OSS with more respect and do not be 
arrogant. You should not be proud of people calling you bad names.

It is OK that you don't want binary non GPL hooks in the kernel. That is 
not the argument. So please stop attacking something I never said.
