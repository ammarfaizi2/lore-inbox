     So you're saying that the two lines that are the GPL's copyright
license, are also part of the terms and conditions of the GPL, and act in
that capacity as a restriction of what you can do under Section 2? That's
an interesting argument, I might agree.

     It's not the GPL doing that, it's the GPL's license. But perhaps the
restrictions of the license are also restrictions of the GPL, they are part
of the text of that document after all.

Well enough pedantism for me.
