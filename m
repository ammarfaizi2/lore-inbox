I had my computer go down hard the other day, while it was sitting
idle (some time during the night).  This was while in X, so no
messages was visible on the screen, and nothing was recorded in the
logs.

When rebooting, Linux oopsed several times while running ext2.fsck,
requiring reboots every time, on different partitions attached to
different IDE-controllers.

I only recorded one of the oopses (by hand, so there may be mistakes
although I did proof-read it).

Since then the kernel has been rock-solid, and I have been running the
same 2.4.3-kernel since then.

I am running Debian unstable, current every day.


The system is a dual Pentium III 800EB on an MSI 6321 mainboard (MSI
694D Pro AI), only IDE drives:
