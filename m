Look, I don't want this to sound harsh, but what did you expect?
What you have arranged for with Linus[1] using BK[2] is so contro-
versial that you must have expected to get A LOT of shit thrown at
you in the process, regardless of how much good/evil your work would
have caused.  I'd expect that by now you would have long learnt
to completely ignore all the nonconstructive posts in the never-ending
BK threads and only focus on resolving technical problems.

[1] As one of the few symbols of the open source world.
[2] As proprietary software with lots of strings attached.

Alan's qualities are elsewhere, I'm sure you've noticed.
