X-Authentication-Info: Submitted using SMTP AUTH at out009.verizon.net from [151.205.42.91] at Mon, 29 Nov 2004 00:48:56 -0600
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I just went to vger.kernel.org and ran the MX-VERIFY-CGI script 
against my mailing address and it seemed to work ok, unlike last week 
when verizon had an overloaded mail box somewhere that not only 
caused some huge lags, but probably bounced so many messages to me 
that I got suspended.

Is there anyone here on this list that can throw some light on why 
I've not got any messages from the lkml since a burst of about 275 
early Friday morning?  Or if I've been suspended/unsubscribed, fix it 
back up?

At that time, the above script was failing when it got to my src 
mailserver at verizon.net.  Now it is not, but still no mail.  
Sniff...
