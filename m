Dear all,

I am currently running 2.4.18 (Redhat 7.3) but would like to upgrade to
2.5.59.

This is because I would like to implement the SCTP transport protocol
which comes in the form of .patch.

I am confused as to if I should upgrade and install the kernel before
applying the patch or do both together.

Furthermore, may I use the kernel sources on this site since I can't
find 2.5.59 on redhat?

Thank you.
