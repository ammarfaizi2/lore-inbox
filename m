	Latest things I've just started playing with are these "Intelligent
Sticks" or "I Sticks".  They look like a chip, similar in form factor to
the memory sticks, but slide into the open half of a USB jack, even
though the contact pads wouldn't look like a good match.  No connector
shell, so they're really flat.  I wonder just how "Intelligent" they
are.  I'm bet'n that wear leveling ain't part of it.  But they are cute
chips that fit in a wallet easily and can boot a fully encrypted laptop.
Once working, they'll almost never need rewriting to any large extent.
The 1G chips can hold a complete OS like Knoppix or Basilisk (the 512Meg
chips too, with a lot of squeezing).
