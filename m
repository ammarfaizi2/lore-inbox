in Russia. I have a very sensitive and confidential=20
brief from this top (oligarch) to ask for your=20
partnership in re-profiling funds over
US$45million. These funds could be transfer batch by batch at US$5milli=
on=20
and/or  as a lump sum based on your request and proposal
I will give the details, but in summary, the funds are coming
via Bank Menatep. This is a legitimate transaction.
You will be paid 25% for your "management fees".
If you are interested, please write back by=20
email: peterhall@mail2world.com =20

fax number and email address

Please keep this confidential; we can=92t afford more political
problems.
Finally, please note that
this must be concluded within two weeks. Please write
back promptly.I will also
suggest you visit these news sites on the internet to
be better informed about
this project.
