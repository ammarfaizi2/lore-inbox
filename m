I didn't know this.  The MAINTAINERS file lists Creative and gives what
looks like a generic email address, although I know not to trust that
file.  Perhaps it should be updated.

I would not mind being a liason between the Creative Open Source
development and the official kernel -- creating and forwarding patches
and so forth, but I am not really involved in the drivers development.

I just want to keep a driver I use up to date.
