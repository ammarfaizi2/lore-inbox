Ahh, I think I found the problem....

I tried scanning with dev=ATAPI, and cdrecord did not found anything.
Then I tried in my home box, and it found the burner.
The problem is that in the 'strange' box the burner is hdh, and the
hard drive for system is hde. The previous IDE channels are unused
(an on-board promise with ide[01], hd[abcd]).
I use udev, so there is no hd[a-d] nodes on /dev. And cdrecord
_EXITS_ as soon as it founds a non-existent device !!!

With a quick'n'dirty hack (ln -s hde hd[abcdfg]), cdrecord finally
got the list:

nada:~> cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus

I will try to look at the cdrecord sources and make a real patch...
I suppose cdrecord will have a bugzilla or mailing list.

Many things will have to change with udev ;)

Thanks for your time and explanations.
