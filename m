Please CC me in!

Please find attached details of an oops I get in 2.5.7-pre2 with the
attached config.

Up to 2.5.7-pre1 ACPI worked fine with System, Processor and Button
options enabled.

If I disable all the options, leaving just ACPI support, it still oopss.

If I disable ACPI totally, it boots fine.
If I disable Power management, but leave ACPI and option selected, it
also oopss.

The only change I have made to the vanilla tree is the changes is
fs/reiserfs/journal.c that I was told about on here the other day.

Alex
