Actually, this is what Larry said:

This is not a problem of fundraising, but a problem of fund management
and policy. You get the funds, how you use them is another concern.

| public domain. 

But we don't want less people using (for example), the Linux kernel. We
don't even want people who can't pay to pay. As long as a large enough
group pays, you're really better off.

And here is what Rik said:

| In the areas where open source software is doing well, there
| already is funding by interested parties (companies, government,
| universities, ...).

Meaning the kernel and some other OSS areas are already well funded.

| Some other areas won't ever get the funding through donations,

Here he seems to be suggesting that certain areas of OSS that can't get
enough funds should either relicense, drop the towel or do it for the
love as a part time job. I am suggesting they could all relicense to a
single license that leverages each others work and centrally manages
fundraising (but not fundspendings). 

| In short, I believe the voluntary donations aren't needed in
| most areas people would donate to and won't make enough of an
| impact in the areas where they are needed.

Now he is poining out something that I had stated in my first message:

... and has nothing to do with the ability to raise the funds. The
Kernel may not need the money but that it could help in a lot of areas
of OSS where a kickstart is needed (after which I am sure they will be
able to contribute funds back to the pool). 

Regarding your opinion on the pyramid nature of the system well that can
be forgiven :)

The real facts that I am aware are:

- the kernel doesn't need the money
- the idea of _enforcing_ payment may not be an option or what is wanted
- there are doubt's about how many people would end up paying
- it will not be easy to manage the funds and could have side effects
- it may be nearly imposible to relicense the kernel due to the large
number of people involved even if they wanted

But the last fact invalidates all others:

"The idea is discarded, nobody likes it"

Which is fine! And I certainly am at the wrong place, poluting a
developement list and wasting your time. So I'll stop replying to your
flames (even though I find them funny and creative :-)

Regards!

Federico
