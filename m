Would you please show me where?  At most you'll find a warning we should
be vigilant, that we should be thinking about how to improve the level of
discussion of important patches.

Private patch streams containing important work have always tended to
dissipate the essential strength of the community, in my opinion.
Bitkeeper just makes it easier.  That is far from suggesting Linux is
teetering on the brink.
