yes.  you'll need to raise the DAC volumes.

what program did you use?
if you want to duplicate signals to surround ,etc., you can configure
it in your ~/.asoundrc file.  (only for ALSA apps, though.)
we don't do signal duplication in kernel.

> B) Instead of the typical <Master> <PCM> <Line> etc channels in alsamixer I have DAC[1-7], with the front left & right channel being <DAC> and <DAC1>.  Is this normal?

yes.  it's not a typical consumer card.
if you have 6 or 8 channels, which should be called "Master"? :)

> C) mplayer (http://www.mplayerhq.hu) compiled with alsa support will detect the card but fails a snd_pcm_hw_params_set_format call.  It will work fine via OSS emulation however.  The same build of mplayer works fine via alsa with other cards, tho.  Is this a driver problem, a hardware limitation, or a problem in mplayer?

the problem of application.  the application should use plug (or
other) plugin to convert the sample format on user-space.
