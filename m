That is interesting, I had the motherboard on my machine replaced
several weeks ago to correct a problem where it would not switch from
one battery to the other.  BTW, it looks like the battery problem was
not fixed.  The hard disk problem could be related to the motherboard
swap, though the machine has been completely stable under 2.4.17 since
the motherboard was replaced.

I hate intermittent errors like this, because the problem might exist
under 2.4.17, but for whatever reason I am unlikely enough to hit it
that I can get 10 days of uptime.  Even under 2.4.18-rc4, I have had
uptimes ranging from 24 hours to 30 minutes.
