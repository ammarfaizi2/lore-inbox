The main complaint I've heard now is "if I develop a product
that competes with bitkeeper, won't I be able to grab <free
software project available in BK> any more ??"

A fix for this would be "make patches available from bkbits.net".

This way everybody can still get the free software, they just
won't have the benefits of bitkeeper's version control or other
nice luxuries.

Rik
