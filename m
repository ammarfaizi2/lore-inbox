That's hilarious and ironic.  It was because of the hefty price of
things like the TekXpress XP15 that I first got interested in Linux
(Slackware 1.0.2) as a relatively cheap and effective X-terminal for our
clients running on a DECstation 5000 (MIPS R3000).

The name TekExpress or TekXpress could be confusing since some had 68020
or 68030 CPUs and some had the MIPS R3000 if I remember correctly. 
Googling shows quite a few variants of name/CPU type.
