Well I have a pair and one is an unreleased chipset version I develop a
lot of code on.

Recall the RAID 0 report of 109MB/sec writing and 167MB/sec reading, well
that was generated on a dual athlon.  Mind the fact these are certified
boards from AMD and are reference boards.

	http://www.linux-ide.org/.athy/athlonpass.jpg

This is the authentication tag for one of the referrence boards used for
the creation of the Tyan Board.  No I can not disclose much more than
this, but the original Tyan Board that was a cadillac with all the options
is the preferred board.  The BIOS I have is the Tyan 2.06a but that one
may be gone.

So as for who makes the best board for dual athlon, AMD; however, those
are hard to come by regardless.

Oh and if you would like a tool suite to test you systems for stablity,
I will be happy to license for a fee so that you can make your customers
more confident about the product.
