Look at it this way,
    by refusing to allow forward progress, many people have to work
around the kernel
    xorg and other developers have had to hack their way around the
kernel limitations
          to get hardware acceleration.
    Don't you think Intel might release a binary driver if the options
were available.
    While legacy systems still exist, they should not hamper the newer ones.
    As long as ATI and Nvidia, Intel and AMD, and Cisco and IBM compete against
          each other closed source and binary drivers are needed.
Does Linux want
          to oppose innovation in graphics and networking.
    It looks like a cockfight to me and that is not good for the image
of developers.

I bet SUSE would rather get the kernel fixed than to hack around it
for XGL and compviz

Regards,
      Ian
