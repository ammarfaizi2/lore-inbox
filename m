Subject: MEPs reaction to software patent issues

This is somewhat off-topic, but at the same time relevant for many of
you in the U.K.

I sent my own 'fact sheet' about European software patents to an MEP
who seemed more interested that most in this issue, due to the
mis-information being spread in McCarthy's so called 'fact sheet'.

Guess what I receieved in response?  A letter which was an exact
duplicate of the E-Mail he sent me in response to my original letter
on the matter.

John.
