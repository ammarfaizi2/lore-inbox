Harnessing energy (rockets, nukes, etc) is fundamentally an unlimited
engineering opportunity.  But kernel development is mostly an attempt to
reduce overhead to zero. If a kernel runs 90% efficient now, then there's
only 10% additional improvement possible.

On the other hand application software is fundamentally unlimited.

So if you want to work on reliability, portability, maintainability, and
adaptation to new hardware then kernels make a good career.  But if you want
to break new ground, then it's either application space or hardware.
