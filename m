F_GETLK indicates a conflict by changing the arg struct to show the
conflicting lock.

As for the original topic, I would hesitate before changing the client
locking code to return EAGAIN just because the server is in its grace
period.  The "blocking" or "non-blocking" behavior is tied to what
happens when there is already a lock that conflicts with the requested
one.  When the server is in the grace period, it's unknown as to
whether there is already a lock that conflicts with the requested
one.
