I know, but before you groan and then killfile me, I need to know tech stuff about VXD's for my winmodem driver, so far ive got a HSP. I need to know more about it, links anybody? Just ask for more info if you need to know.

Cheers, Dean McEwan. Currently hacking KGI, which I don't understand, oh and ask me about OpenModemTalk...
