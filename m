This is the problem:

With 2.6.0-test9 i have a 15 % lower performance on timing buffered disk
reads.

What i did:

Yesterday i installed 2.6.0-test8-mm1 with the following kernel-config:

After the reboot i did a: hdparm -t /dev/hde, which gave me a average of 
45.5 MB/sec over 5 runs.

The settings i use:

After the hdparm test i configured 2.6.0-test9 which uses
config-2.6.0-test8-mm1.
When everything was ready i did a reboot and again i executed hdparm -t 
/dev/hde which gave me a average timing buffered disk reads of 
38.5 MB/sec.over 5 runs. (i used the same settings)

I was confused, so i did a: diff config-2.6.0-test8-mm1 config-2.6.0-test9
which gave me the following output:

wuuk:/boot# diff config-2.6.0-test8-mm1 config-2.6.0-test9
33d32
< CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y
87,91d85
< # CONFIG_X86_4G is not set
< # CONFIG_X86_SWITCH_PAGETABLES is not set
< # CONFIG_X86_4G_VM_LAYOUT is not set

< # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SGIIOC4 is not set
302a295
> # CONFIG_SCSI_SATA is not set
483d475
< # CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER is not set

Conclusion:

CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ is removed from 2.6.0-test9

Questions:

Am i right with my conclusion ?
Is this the reason for the loss of performance ?

Please i hope someone can explain this..............thx
