That is the always repeated answer. I could get a web page at some box at the
University, but there are many people that have not a permanent address. Going
to the mess of using a ISP-provided web page is a pain. Instead of bzip your
patch and send it to the list you have to go through bizarre http interfaces
to manage your web page (tell me about a ISP that lets you telnet/ssh/ftp to your
account).

I do not see why a bzipped patch is so bad. The only person I was aware he won't 
read anything but plain text is Linus (and now some on this thread look with
the same feeling).
