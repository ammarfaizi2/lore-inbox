Play your game your way or get out of Dodge eh?  I have opinions on 
that, but they aren't printable on a public list.

But at least we ALL know now who you are STILL working for, don't we?  
If you were such a gung-ho FOSS fan, it should have been offered to 
the eff or fsf.

It brings up another sore point with me.  I'm of the opinion that both 
copyright, and patent, should be granted to the author/inventor on a 
non-transferable basis.  He could then sell rights to use it for a 
set period of time, at the end of which it is still his.  The 
present, sell it to the highest bidder situation too often leaves 
talented folks in the soup lines at the local mission because they 
were screwed out of the benefits their invention or composition 
should have brought them.

Correction Jeff, you sent that link to the list, and IMNSHO, it was 
your job to see to it the mimetype was properly set.  It was not.
