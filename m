Subject: BCM5700 Gbit driver in 2.2.xx kernel

Hello,

I was trying to build a monolytic Linux 2.2.20 kernel for a Dell 2550
system, but found that the BCM5700 Gbit driver is not part of the Linux  2.2
series. Is someone putting effort in making the driver go into the 2.2
kernel or will it only be used as a module?

Greetings, John
