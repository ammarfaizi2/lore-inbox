Sounds like music to  me :-) If I would not be (very)
familiar with LISP prior to that project, I would not
chose it probably. It's syntax is so simple (it is a
marvel :-) I would think twice to put in the kernel
something with more complex syntax.

After all Emacs uses LISP, too :-) Though it is this
big one - Common Lisp :-)
