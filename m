The point is to avoid having to develop and test 23 different and highly
arch-dependent (and hence non-maintainable) versions of the same code.
In particular note that many of those architectures appear to be heavily
over-optimized to directly inline assembly code as well as to use
non-standard calling conventions. They all also manage somehow to differ
w.r.t. spinlocking conventions and even w.r.t. the internal structures
and algorithms used.

IOW: the current semaphore implementations really all need to die, and
be replaced by a single generic version to which it is actually
practical to add new functionality.

Failing that, it is _much_ easier to convert the generic code that needs
to support aio to use a new locking implementation and then test that.
It is not as if conversion to aio won't involve changes to the code in
the area surrounding those locks anyway.

Cheers,
  Trond
