specifically, I am trying to write a program similar
to the old Sidekick program of the DOS days. A
"daemon", if you will, that will popup on the screen
when a predetermined series of keystrokes are hit. The
program will then do various things, like record/play
macros, calculator, calendar, programmer's guide, etc
etc...

The part I'm having trouble with though is having it
popup when predetermined keystrokes are pushed. I
don't think Linux has a way to hook into the keyboard
(if I'm wrong, someone please tell me).
