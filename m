Sorry to feed the trolls, but I couldn't resist. Isn't OSX just
a commercial re-hash of BSD that Jobs "appropriated"?  The performance
has been so poor with the PPC platform that Apple has been forced
to sign a pack with the devil and use ix86 in their future boxes.

I'm not making this up! It would have been nice to have a competing
platform remaining to keep everybody honest. Now that Apple is
going Intel, we will be forced to use whatever the Indians provide.

Cheers,
