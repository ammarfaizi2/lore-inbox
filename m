Subject: [2.6.0-test4] VFS: Cannot open root device
Message-ID: <20030825130331.GA20696@vinku.pingviini.net>

I get this at boot with 2.6.0-test[3,4]:

VFS: Cannot open root device "341" or unknown-block(3,65) for ext3 error=-6
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(3,65)

Before this, kernel seems to detect hard disks just fine.

This system boots fine with 2.2 and 2.4 kernels. I have tried setting
root=/dev/hdb1 and rootfstype=ext2 (hdb1 is ext2) but this doesn't help.
Config below. Is something missing?

Thanks a lot for suggestions,
    - Nikke

P.S. Cc:ing appreciated.
