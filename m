Alan,

Last time I checked, if there is a bug, you submit a report, and it is
fixed or a solution to fix it is reviewed/accepted.

BUGREPORT: GPLv2 is broken and leaves the kernel in a near unprotected
state where authors/copyright holders must bare the cost to defend their
works.

FIX: Migration to OSL 1.1 with language to address compatiblity issues
with GPLvN operating in an OSL enviroment.

ACTION: Using the credits list as a principle test for initial contract
for disclosing terms of migration.

Come on, don't be a stick in the mud.  This is Linux, the definition of
doing it better and faster.

Cheers,
