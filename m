I've been using the the -ck patchset for a very long time, and I recently 
switched to a amd64 arch. I found that while my throughput improved, my 
system responsiveness has "felt" much lower than it did on my old x86 
machine.

Now that interbench is around, I have some quantitative results. Attached is 
my interbench results with *nothing* running other than agetty and a single 
bash console. My system is an AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+, with 1gig 
DDR400 RAM. Also attached is my kernel config.

Seems to me there are some pretty high latencies for such a powerful system, 
is there anything I can do to improve this? Thanks for all your help.
