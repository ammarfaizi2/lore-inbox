At what level is "Product" - do you need a category. How do you want
to classify devices. I think this matters because you want eventually
to be able to deal with things like tools that let users rate their
setup functionality and submit it automatically.

Wikipedia has a discussion page tagged to each article/entry. This works
extremely well because it provides a public forum for discussion of what
does/doesn't work, why and when.

Could you add "Kernel.org bugzilla #" for not working ones, both to help
people track them and to encourage submissions ?
