Hi.

I want to submit the ARM26 architecture. its still broken, but its
getting there. now a couple more people want to hack on it, so I'd
appreciate it if you could put the non-invasive parts into the kernel
tree for me.

I have two patches - one to add arch/arm26 and another to add the
corresponding incluse/asm-arm26

will you accept them?

Do not meddle in the affairs of Dragons, for you are tasty and good with
ketchup.

Systems programmers keep it up longer.
