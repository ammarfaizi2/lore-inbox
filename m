[Please CC me on replies, thanks]

On linux 2.6.2 on x86, I sometimes (not always) get zombie processes
only under certain parents. The only ones I've noticed are logrotate,
started by run-parts, in turn started by anacron; and netstat, started
by mozilla. Either one of these show up independently with no apparent
pattern. I've found a couple other similar reports on the web:

  http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0311.2/0508.html
  http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0309.3/0401.html
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=101221

The last doesn't mention the kernel version, but sounds the same. The
first two both mention that the problem only happens when preemption is
enabled. However, I've gotten the zombie processess with and without
preemption. Also, this is on a lightly loaded system.

A changelog from October says this:

  ChangeSet 2003/10/26 19:16:23-08:00, torvalds @ home.osdl.org

  Add a sticky "PF_DEAD" task flag to keep track of dead processes.

  Use this to simplify 'finish_task_switch', but perhaps more
  importantly we can use this to track down why some processes
  seem to sometimes not die properly even after having been
  marked as ZOMBIE. The "task->state" flags are too fluid to
  allow that well.

Was that ever cleared up, or is this perhaps the same problem?

I don't know if any of the following info is useful, but the
REPORTING-BUGS file suggests including it.
