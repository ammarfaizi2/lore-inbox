i guess it's a general scheduler issue.

why you face this problem more severly than others:
the timing on the ice1712 (envy24) chip is quite tight, because it
always needs 32bit * 10 channels interleaved samples even if you want
to play a two-channel mp3 file.  more badly, the maximum buffer size
is limited to 64k byte.  hence, at most, you can get about 0.1 sec for
the hardware buffer.  if the task switching to the audio thread cannot
be done in 0.1 sec, you'll get audio drop outs.

the recent scheduler patch might help...
