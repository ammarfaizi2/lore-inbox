Wait. What I said could not possibly apply to comments you, or anybody
else for that matter, made within this thread. What I said refers to
events and threads which have long since passed. The "resistance" I
allude to is that faced by ltt early on and for as long as several
parties were actively involved in trying to standardize on it. I'm
merely trying to explain the current status of this: several teams
in "apparent" competition one another.

Please read this in the above context -- passed events. In as far as
my understanding of events as I was part of them, this was the
best I made of the decision-making thought process at a managerial
level. And I do not wish to substantiate that nor was this meant as
a personal attack against any person or organization. Everyone acted
to the best of their knowledge of the facts at the time and I cannot
fault them for that. I disagreed and was disappointed, obviously,
but that's mine to bear.

Put simply: all parties involved would actually wish things were
different.
