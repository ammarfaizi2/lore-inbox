Right ... but if bugs were sent to netdev or whatever, you'd get 
something similar to what you have today, as long as *you* don't
go looking in bugme (which you've made it clear you won't). Other
people seem to find this useful, and they can still go use it if 
they like.

So presumably that'd work out OK?
