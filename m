I have had sucess in firmware-upgrading these drives, after which all 
problems were gone forever.

You can download the firmware programs from 
http://anders.fugmann.dhs.org/ibm. There are both upgrade for 75GXP and 
60GXP, or you could contact IBM for the firmware upgrade - They are not 
available on the ibm site. The programs are Windows thingies, which 
creates a floppy to be booted.
