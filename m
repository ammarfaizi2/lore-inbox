This thread has certainly convinced *me* that the only way to *really*  
solve this problem is by finding a better way of looking at the problem,  
finding a better model/abstraction/whatever.

Of course, finding that isn't particularly easy either. But with such a  
thing, *most* (certainly not all) of the current hard problems should just  
"fall out" naturally.

That may, of course, mean that some current fundamental assumption isn't  
really as fundamental as we think right now. But it's hard to speculate  
before having actually found the above new view of the problem!

Time to let the subconscious work on it more than time to code, I think.
