That must've be some testing to catch this :)

It makes sense.  However, I'm not sure whether we want to add a read
barrier to the common path in kfree_skb just for a debugging test.
If it was only for the skb->list test we could move the read barrier
inside the if and reread skb->list if it were non-NULL.

What you've done is expose a much bigger problem in Linux.  We're
using atomic integers to signal that we're done with an object.
The object is usually represented by a piece of memory.

The problem is that in most of the places where we do this (and that's
not just in the networking systems), there are no memory barriers between
the last reference to that object and the decrease on the atomic counter.

For example, in this particular case, a more sinister (but probably
impossible for sk_buff objects) problem would be for the list removal
itself to be delayed until after the the kfree_skb.  This could
potentially mean that we're reading/writing memory that's already
been freed.

Perhaps we should always add a barrier to such operations.  So
kfree_skb would become

	if (atomic_read(&skb->users) != 1) {
		smp_mb__before_atomic_dec();
		if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&skb->users))
			return;
	}
	__kfree_skb(skb);

Cheers,
