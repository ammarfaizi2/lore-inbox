Subject: Hi memory support in 2.4 not working correctly.

I have a compaq 8 way server with 4 gigs of memory.  I am running 2.4.0 and
everything works just fine (except the gig - I'm still fighting with that)
The only strange thing that I am seeing is that I only see 3.3 gigs of
memory instead of the full 4.  Has anyone seen this and possibly know of a
fix?

The irony is that Bill Gates claims to be making a stable operating system
and Linus Torvalds claims to be trying to take over the world
