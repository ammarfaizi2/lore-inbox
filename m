Hi,

I hope I'm not totally wrong here, but I figured this would be a good 
place to start, the kernel-config list seems a bit dead.

I've been thinking about creating a community-driven .config repository, 
since I havent found any good place for this sort of information.
I would see it as a place for people to contribute .configs for various 
hardware/platforms and keep them updated and current with the kernel 
releases.

Perhaps this exist(i havent found any easily), or is considered a bad 
idea(please tell me), or is actually a good idea.

Tell me what you think, sorry if I might have sent this to the wrong list.

Keep up the good work.

Best regards,
    Eric
