Indeed, colleagues of mine pointed me to this article and it's an
 unbelievable piece of FUD. Let me translate the first lines for the
 non-Italian speaking...

'Even Linux ends up in court'

 "The open source community born around the "open" operating system
  rises against founder Linus Torvalds, accused of centralizing power
  and encumbering technology development" 

The supposed accusers:

 "a few developers accusing him of insufficient flexibility in his
  own choices"

but later these become

 "the entire Open Source community, for example, wonders whether
  Linux development may suffer from Torvalds' power, who decides
  all of the development strategies, what functions get integrated
  and what are left out. Decisions that may have positive or negative
  influence on firms of RedHat's importance and others involved in
  commercial distributions of Linux".

To top this off with complete crap, after mentioning Gracenote:

 "There may be a paradoxical situation: the [Microsoft] appeal judge
  may restore the Microsoft monolith that judge Jackson wanted to
  break in small pieces. And in the meantime who could end up under
  accusation for excessive power and monopoly "temptation" would be
  the arch-enemy Torvalds."


I have trouble in finding words to describe such blatant ignorance.
