People are using the archive and discovering my earlier question about
getting lm_sensors to work on the Asus A7A266, and are now writing to
see whether I ever got a solution.

I did, and since I have had a number of enquiries I decided to excerpt
the correspondence as a pseudo-howto.  I am posting this message in
hopes that others may find the information useful.

The information is at
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/bdbryant/howtos/hardware/asus-a7a266/lm_sensors/

Good luck with it, and holler if you have better suggestions.
