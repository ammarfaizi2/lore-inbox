	Don't blame me. The GPL just says the "preferred" form and leaves us 
to wonder. As I understand it, however, you cannot ship binaries of a 
GPL'd project unless you can distribute the source code in the 
"preferred form .. for making modifications to it".

	I'm still perplexed what you do if the preferred modification form 
for a work requires consent to a license more restrictive than the 
GPL in order to make modifications to it. As I see it, you just can't 
GPL such a project.

	And you can't take a GPL'd work and turn it into a non-GPL'd work 
and continue to distribute binaries.
