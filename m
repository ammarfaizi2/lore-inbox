There's already vendor-sec. I assume they follow RFPolicy already. If it's 
just another vendor-sec, why would you put up a new list for it?

In other words, if you allow embargoes and vendor politics, what would the 
new list buy that isn't already in vendor-sec.

When I saw how vendor-sec worked, I decided I will never be on an embargo 
list. Ever. That's not to say that such a list can't work - I just 
personally refuse to have anything to do with one. Whether that matters or 
not is obviously an open question.
