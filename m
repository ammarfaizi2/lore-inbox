   i'm also a bit worried about the legal status of commit messages posted
   via bkbits. Are they GPL-ed automatically, can we just take them and put
   them into a free-BK type server? We already have one precedent of a
   business entity abusing a free OS project and then suing it (and winning
   the suit), hindering the free OS's development for years.

Larry has stated many times over that he doesn't own our bits.

That is why once you extract content from the repository into some
other form (a patch with the change logs prepended, for example) he
doesn't care what you do with it.

He even said this twice today.
