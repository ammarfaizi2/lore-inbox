IMHO, it's up to the users to decide if they want to keep buying hardware 
which leads to inferior support, less reliability, decreased security and 
all of the other ills associated with binary drivers.  Let them also 
choose distributions which enact the binary driver policies they agree 
with.

Linux is precisely not about forcing people to do things.
