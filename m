	Just to add some sanity to this thread, I have been using the 2.4.x 
kernels ever since they came out, on my personal workstation and on some 
workstations that I administrate for fellow students in my department 
here at UCLA.  They have basically worked fine for me.  They are not 
perfect, but many of the 2.4.x releases have been a big improvement over 
the 2.2.x releases.  For one, 2.4.x actually can tell which pages are 
not used, and swap out unused daemons, which helps a lot on a 64Mb box :)
