So if you consider it obsolete and not interesting any more, why not
hand the de jure maintainership over to Chris? He has been the de facto
mainatainer for a long time.

I find that Reiserfs V3 has just become mature enough in the last half a
year to actually trust my data to it - maybe even on non-x86. Reiserfs
V4 would take some years to gain this trust so I see a real potential
user base for V3 and refusing further development of it seems unwise.
