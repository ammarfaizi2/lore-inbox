Well I just checked net/ipv4/raw.c and it's pretty clear that it does

		err = -EDESTADDRREQ;
		if (sk->sk_state != TCP_ESTABLISHED)
			goto out;

So you need to connect before you can write.  I'm intrigued that
you can write before connecting on a raw socket.  Could you please
write up a minimal program that I can play with?

Well read() is different.  It returns all packets received on
the socket, regardless of where they came from.  So for a
connectionless socket it makes perfect sense to read() before
you've called connect().

OTOH, write() and send() needs to know where the message is going
to.  That's exactly what connect() provides.  So it makes no sense
to write()/send() before you've called connect().

Cheers,
