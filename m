What's the status of the module loading code?  I've been compiling them into 
the kernel since something around 2.5.3x when the code was rewritten.  I'd 
like to begin using a few modules again (especially some PCMCIA stuff).  Is 
there any documentation explaining what will be necessary for 2.5 to use 
modules?

Thanks for the help,
Emmett Pate
