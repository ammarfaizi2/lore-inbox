Agreed.  If you are making a derived work, and pasting in stuff from a
GPLed source, your work is definitely derived and you are GPLed.  And I'd
be with everyone else ripping you a new one if you didn't GPL it.

I hope people understand that I respect the GPL and what it has accomplished.
It's a great thing.  People should not abuse it.  My comments which may seem
against that are legal in their basis, not my personal goals.
