Hi,
I've uh "inherited" an elderly RS/6000 250 and wanted to install linux
on it. Googleing for this machine and linux turns up information that it 
is not possible. Yet, this information is a tad older (one to two years
old), so I wondered if anything changed in that regard - 
apparently PPC in combination with the MCA bus were not supported.

Regs,
Sven
