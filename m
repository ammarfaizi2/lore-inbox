We can't discard any cause, but, at mercurial, I just export the
patches, removing all version-dependent code. After doing, I do a diff
between Mercurial and git trees. Only after that, I proceed.

Patch generation seems to be ok, since I have the habit to check all
patches before commiting. Also, diffstat I sent were generated by
looking at the stg exported patches. I dunno if this is common, but
running git-fsck-objects after working for a while with stgit generates

I'll rebuild the entire tree from the beginning, and I'll also update
both git and stg version to latest ones.

I hope this won't happen again.

What is sad is that I can't determinate the root cause of this breakage,
but it seemed to be associated with merging handling at stg or git.

One possibility is that stg pick doesn't seem to be preserving commit
date, so that patches are compared with the wrong versions.

The first 141 patches were committed in the past, starting from the end
of 2.6.15 window and were already committed at stgit. I just did a git
pull . prev to retrieve they.

The newer 49, however, were not committed yesterday, but also in the
past. Yesterday, I just picked them from work branch. However, stgit
marked commit timestamp as if they were just committed. This might have
generated some troubles at resolution conflict code on git.
