Hi,
Does the System.map file contain only the addresses of kernel functions
present at the boot time. What I mean is, suppose I insert a new driver
into the kernel, Is there any way to show its addresses in the System.map
file? Please help me out with this.

Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
sathish
