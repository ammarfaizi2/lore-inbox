Does it matter? If an 'open source guy' comes up with the idea
independently, having never had a copy of the 'closed source', then he
has proof that he came up with it originally (although he may not be
the first to have thought of it).

And who cares about "first"? How can you ever guarantee that somebody
didn't think of your idea "first"? Maybe aliens having been using B-Tree's
for billions of years.

It doesn't matter.
