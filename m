exactly! and either way the user would need that space allocated ANYWAY.

actually if you provide the mmap method yourself you're not going to
need get_user_pages(), because it's kernel allocated memory already!

see above; it's one or the other. Personally I'd think the mmap method
is simpler, because there's less conditions to consider (again, the
malicious user passing you memory that is mmap'd PCI MMIO space is a
"fun" example, but there's a lot more cafes which are... funky)
