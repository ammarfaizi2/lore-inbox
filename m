Has it been decided not to put in CML2 into 2.5.x?  I haven't seen much
talk of it (besides the patch being taken out of kbuild 2.5 and ESR
dropping off the list).  Also I have not seen any word of it on Guillaume
Boissiere's 2.5 kernel status page.  I had thought that and the new kbuild
(by Keith Owens) were suppose to be in the kernel since 2.5.1.
