I was not aware of all of this as being the case.  I am sorry they are
stuck in such a bad position.  It does raise my opinion of them quite a
bit.

No, my belief may not reflect what is, but that doesn't make it false. 
I know there were, at least until recently, countries that actually
dictated what I said by law.  Again, how much did reality follow the
laws... your guess would probably be better than mine.

I expect that IP is expensive to buy.  Anyway, thank you for explaining
the Nvidia situation to me.  I really hope they do figure out some
things soon.  (Even if that is just how to make kernels with their
modules loaded more stable and easier to debug.)
