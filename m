I apologize for using the D-word, however, I've created some, so I think that 
makes it acceptable.

But first, I was having a little fun kernel-hacking the other day, and I had 
noticed that every time I want information on function-X, I have to start 
grepping like hell, and it's even worse when I don't know the name of the 
function. What we needed was an API (KPI?) reference.

So I made one.

(It seems that 10% of europe can't get that domain: 207.44.242.45)

Obviously, it's not complete, in fact, if it were any less complete, I could 
call it the linux kernel :)

The _real_ reason I post this message is, of course, for help.  I'll be more 
than happy to accept new xml documentation files (the bottom of each page 
contains a link to the associated XML file, as an example).

PS. I'm not on this mailing list (I'm on plenty, don't worry), so I'll be 
following it on the archives.
