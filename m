Hi Randy.

There is also another ISO standard (I forget the number) which states
that the international standard date notation is any of...

	DD.MM.YYYY	(European)
	MM/DD/YYYY	(American)
	YYYY-MM-DD	(Japanese)

...with the punctuation character specifying the one in use. I note that
the dates as originally quoted above are clearly consistant with this
standard, so see no problem myself.

Personally, I prefer to use the DD-MMM-YYYY format myself, where MMM in
the three-letter English abbreviation for the month in question, and
there is thus no room for misreading it as something else.

I'm so used to > quoting in emails that anything else gets me confused.

Best wishes from Riley.
