But that is very short and does not affect the interpretation here.
The throughput is clearly lower on 2.6 kernel and definitely the
CPU is in my eyes unnecessarily blocked... Why is the CPU in the
wait state instead of idle (this is teh problem on 2.6 series
but CPU is free on 2.4 series)? That's the main problem I think at the
moment.
