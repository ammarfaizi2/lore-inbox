Indeed. The GPL may not be perfect, but IMHO the GPL is the only way to make
sure everyone plays the game according to the rules. I.e. I give you something,
you can use it, but please play according to the rules of fair play.

BSD may look OK, but it doesn't protect against people who don't (want to) play
according to the rules.

I consider binary-only modules some kind of loophole to avoid playing according
to the rules of fair play.

Unfortunately it seems to be almost impossible to design a license that forces
you to play according to the rules of fair play, and doesn't have any
loopholes or grey areas.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
