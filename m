You may find this one fine, but that doesn't make it fly, sorry.
Requiring people to redistribute the license notice in all
documentation included with the binaries is an additional restriction
which is not found in the GPL. So a very clear no cannot do.

This is also known as the BSD 'advertisement' clause which was the
main reason we could never use BSD code in the old days. Berkeley has
since updated their license and removed this clause from it, however
the license still poses a problem since it doesn't include an explicit
patent license grant, but thats a completely different issue.

Cheers,
Jes
