Ur gripe is about why I posted it in lkml and I have answered that. U can
argue that I could _also_ have posted it in other forums but thats up to
me. U can't deny that it _is_ about the kernel (but not the kernel alone).
Whether it is about other GPL software as well is irrelevant beccause I
never claimed its about the kernel alone.

U r beating about the same bush as usual. My question _does_ apply to
other GPL software too but thats irrelevant. Because the case I
highlighted is about the kernel. Remember that the GPL also says something
about the copyright holder of the _particular_ software (which is not the
FSF for sure in case of the kernel). So the idea of discussing it in lkml
is a good idea.

I don't give a damn what u consider as "failed" or "succeeded" because my
questions were answered by more than one people here and I am happy that
the issue has been resolved. So take ur whining elsewhere.
