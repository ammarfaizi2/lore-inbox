I authored the mess.

The GPL extra names are because back in the Andrew Balsa days of the
2.0.33,4,5-Jumbo patch series Aubry, Andrzey, et al, we all worked
togather.

Only Sun (osb4,csb5a) and I (osb4,csb5,csb6,csb6a) are the true authors.

I am just lazy and do not delete people's names.

What is wrong with it all now?
