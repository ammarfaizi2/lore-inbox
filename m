Sorry, I must have lost track of this argument. I thought the point of
contention was the RTLinux patent, which seems pretty clear on the key
issue: if your stuff is GPL, we're GPL; if you make money, we want a slice
of the pie. Now it almost sounds like you're telling us that the real
issue is that you can't make your own Linux-as-nonfree-rtos. Well, I'm not
very smart, so maybe I've misunderstood.

That dog won't hunt. There are more players in the Linux embedded/RT space
than RTAI and RTLinux, which you have conveniently overlooked throughout
this entire thread. Maybe at this time none of them are ready for $300
IPO pops, but you can't make the argument that "RT is closed to Linux"
when your only data points are RTAI and RTLinux.
