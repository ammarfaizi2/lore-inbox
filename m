I don't want you to, I want you to go on and get rich.  However, you might
possibly be nagged into remembering you made an offer.  Go back and look
at the offer, see if there were strings attached at the time.

No, of course not, you're biased.  Expected.

How about a URL instead?  Any objection?

Why ask Jeff as opposed to submitting such a patch myself?  The first thing
I'd do is edit out the 'repeatedly', perhaps the whole 'Linus stated' thing,
it's mere rhetoric.

I'd rather see the URL happen though, it just makes so much sense.

True, but I'm a contributor and so I have an interest in it.  It would be
better if you didn't pursue that line of argument.

How about the URL?
