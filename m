hello,

I have written several times to kraxel at bytesex dot com but I got no 
reply.

I have data for a new bttv 878 based card that I think must be 
introduced in the cards database info in order to make it work.

Who is the maintainer of that driver right now?

Thanks a lot!

P.S.: CC me if you can... I'm not subscribed.
