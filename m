hi everyone!



for those interested in linux audio development, the linux audio 
conference 2005 (http://lac.zkm.de) at the center for arts and media in 
karlsruhe/germany will be streamed live in both vorbis and theora formats.

the conference takes place from april 21 - 24, with lectures and 
workshops from 11:00 to 18:00 UTC+2 every day and concerts in the evenings.

i would like to invite you to join us, either in person (attendance to 
the conference is free) or remotely over the internet.

for remote participants of the conference, there is a chat room #lac2005 
on irc.freenode.net. a chat operator will be present in the auditorium 
in karlsruhe and will relay your questions to the lecturer and the local 
audience. papers and slides will be made available for download in 
advance if possible.

information about the streams and how to watch them is at 
http://lac2005.zkm.de.

huge kudos to the icecast, ogg, vorbis and theora developers and 
communites for their code and expertise!



kind regards,


jörn nettingsmeier
on behalf of the linux audio community
