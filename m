I have a MSI K7T Turbo board with Athlon 1.2 GHz. Recently I upgraded my 
Award Bios from 2.7 to 2.9. This new version has "memory bank 
interleaving". It also improves the stability of my system a lot. I do 
not know if these are related, but is may be a hint for some of the 
experts out there.

Cheers,
