I would agree to this. I will meet with SCO Monday and see if they will 
accept this as a proposal. I think
they probably will.

They gave me raw carrots (in a plastic bag on Blake's desk) and Baby 
Ruth candy bars. We met in
Blake's office (The PR Guy). They had their corporate counsel sitting in 
another room and I guess he was
listenting in or something, but he never entered the room. We talked 
about the Novell/Bill Mason/Pamela Jones/Groklaw
connections (all of these people are ex Novell employees). I was met at 
the front door door by Joan (Darl's
admin) and Blake, then Darl came into the Blakes office. They typed a 
letter first roasting GrokLaw then the
SCO general counsel said not to sign it even though Darl wanted him to, 
and they said to have Blake put out
some sort of release instead. Then Darl and I talked about all the Linux 
code for about an hour or so.

Yes. I am waiting for them to send it. I called Joan and Darl after I 
sent this and Darl had left for the day
and Joan called him on his cell phone and I am supposed to talk to Blake 
on Monday.

Agreed. I will do so. I think SCO just wants their stuff our of Linux. 
We should accomodate them.
Who wants to use this stuff besides IBM anyway.

I could ask him...

Yes.

Yes. He said any employee who had access to their source code and who 
fell under the license agreements. It was
somewhat nebulous, and form the way he explained it, the agreements with 
IBM pretty much covered all employees
everywhere. There was some sort of non-compete clause so I think this 
affects everyone.
