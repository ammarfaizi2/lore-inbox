Dear linux-kernel@vger.rutrgers.edu:

The Motion Picture Association (MPA) represents the following motion picture
production and distribution companies:

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.
Disney Enterprises, Inc.
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.
tro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc.
Paramount Pictures Corporation
TriStar Pictures, Inc.
Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation
United Artists Pictures, Inc.
United Artists Corporation
Universal City Studios, Inc.

We have received information that the above referenced Internet site is
providing a circumvention device commonly known as Linux.  Linux is a
software utility that circumvents the protection afforded by the Microsoft
Windows Operating Systems DRM implementation, therefore circumventing the
schemes designed for consumer content protection and permitting the copy of
protected contents in whole or partially.  As such, Linux is an unlawful
circumvention device within the meaning of the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, Title 17 United States Code Section 1201(a)(2)(3).  Providing or
offering Linux to the public on your system or  network violates the
provisions of Section 1201(a)(2) which prohibit the manufacturing, importing
or offering to the public, providing, or otherwise trafficking in an
unlawful circumvention device.   (Title 17 United States Code 
Section 1201 et seq. hereafter is referred to as the DMCA).

We therefore demand that you take appropriate steps to cause the immediate
removal of Linux from the above identified Internet site, along with such
other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to suspend this illegal
activity. Failure to comply with this measure will subject you to liability
as described above.
We also request that you:

1. maintain and take whatever steps are necessary to prevent the destruction
of all records, including electronic records, in your possession or control
related to this Internet site, account holder or subscriber, and 

2. provide appropriate notice to the subscriber or account holder
responsible for the presence of Linux on your system or network, advising
him/her of the contents of this notice and directing that person to contact
the undersigned immediately at the email address provided above.

By copy of this letter, the owner of the above referenced Internet site
and/or email account is hereby directed to cease and desist from the conduct
complained of herein.

On behalf of the respective owners of the exclusive rights to the copyrighted
material at issue in this notice, we hereby state, pursuant to the DMCA that we
have a good faith belief that the acts complained of are not authorized by the
copyright owners, their respective agents, or the law.

Also pursuant to DMCA, we hereby state, under penalty of perjury under the
law of California and under the laws of the United States, that the
information in this notification is accurate and that we are authorized to
act on behalf of the owners of the exclusive rights being infringed as set
forth in this notification. 

Please contact us at the above listed address or by replying to this email
if you should have any questions.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.  Your prompt response is
requested.

Respectfully,

Haminshu Nigam
Director
