HI, im running an Intel raq, with kernel headers:
kernel-headers-2.2.14C11-1
and basically, something has happened to them, because i have NO dir called
/usr/include/linux like i should (and that i require to recompile PHP)

i cannot find anywhere a replacement for that pacakge, so i thought i 
could possibly install the 2.2.14 kernel headers and that would be close 
enough for it not to matter?

Can anyone verify that? am i dicing with death by installing kernel 
headers diffirent from the kernel?

P.s.: I've already tried make dep, no go because i dont even have the 
kernel-2.2.14C11-1 source.

Thanks Gents.

Nervy
