Dear Sir,
I MR. EZRA KOFFI have decided to bestow this trust on you.During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on november 1997 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery  to this development.

Although personally,I keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful. During the time of execution. The said amount was US$10M(Ten million united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through the business directory at chamber of commerce and Industry here in Lome- Togo where I was seaching for a good relaible contact to do the business with.I was elated the time I saw your address  to propose the business to you.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and larification by the correspondent branch of the bank,where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. The sharing rate of this money will be discussed later upon your favourable response showing your zealous determination to assist us but the first priority is your total acceptance and commitment to assist.

Please,you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment,either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in.All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you.

Best Regard,
MR. EZRA KOFFI.
