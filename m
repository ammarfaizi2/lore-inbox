What brand and model is the laptop.  Certainly the error says it is a
bios error, so most likely the maker of the laptop has to fix their
mistakes in the PST table.  I guess mobile semprons being rather new,
bios mistakes are bound to happen in the less tested areas.  And perhaps
windows doesn't care, or maybe frequency scaling doesn't work in windows
either.
