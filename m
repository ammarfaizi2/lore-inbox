Yes, Ogg Vorbis is an excellent example.

It's a shame those investors didn't invest in a WWW site for it: it was
being run on someone's DSL line at home. Their ISP has now folded, leaving
them offline without a site to host www.vorbis.com on...

Yes. The people who "developed" CSS had to keep it proprietary because
that was all they had: if they were able and willing to make money by
selling real products for a reasonable price, they wouldn't need
"security" through obscurity and court cases.

Not really. Souce availability does not automatically make a piece of
software good, nor does a lack of source make it bad. Having the source
code is a good thing, but it doesn't affect the quality of the software
itself.

Yes. I just wish it were a bit easier to determine which hardware that
is...
