Hi folks,

I've been having this problem since 2.4.6 and just attributed it to VM
issues.  However, I've been trying all the latest kernels (2.4.9-acXX,
2.4.10-acXX, 2.4.12-acXX and 2.4.13) and am still getting a deadlock
scenario someplace.  In fact, my system hung up in about 2 minutes after
booting the 2.4.13 kernel.

I don't think I'm doing anything weird in my system.  Most times it
hangs during a kernel build (I do lots of these) but yesterday
2.4.12-ac3 hung while the machine was idle for a few minutes.

I've tried to keep "top" visible so that I can get some idea what the VM
state is when it hangs, but so far nothing stands out.  Most times, swap
is empty or nearly so and there even appears to be some free memory. 
Also, I don't see any signs of a kernel Oops in the syslog, so that
doesn't appear to be the problem.

I never saw any hangs on 2.4.4, but the VM was so poor there, the system
wasn't much fun to use.

The systemn is a RedHat 7.0 installation with some updates.  gcc is
2.96-85 (Latest from RedHat.)  X is XFree 4.0.1.  I thought maybe it was
a DRI issue, so I rebuilt 2.4.12-ac3 with DRI for XFree 4.0 but it
didn't help.

Anyway, I'd appreciate any ideas you people have.


Here's some info on the hardware:
P3-850
512 MB RAM
1 GB swap
plenty of harddrive space (approx. 6 GB free)
