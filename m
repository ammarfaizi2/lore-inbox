Hello, respected Linux kernel developers,
    I am currently a university student taking a "Advanced design of 
Operating Systems" class at
New York University. We are reviewing some basic and studying a few 
advanced issues with regards
to kernel design, mostly multithreading, scalability, performance 
improvement - its webpage is http://www.scs.cs.nyu.edu/G22.3033-010/
take a look if you please. The requirement of the class is a final 
project proposal and
implementation of a student's own choosing - I would really like to do 
something useful for the
linux kernel, but I do not know what kinds of issues are most imminent 
at the linux kernel and
have to be worked on. I would greatly appreciate it if people would 
send me ideas of what is
needed and what I can work on - it can be pretty much anything, any 
topic or project, but it must
relate to kernel development, thus I am asking it here. 
I am not subscribed to the list yet, please CC to me your reply.
Thank you very much,
Yuri Niyazov
