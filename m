Sorry, but I didn't know this notice until now. I'm one year outdated ;-)
But anyway, do you not think that we can support the PNG format through
kernel? It was designed thinking in opensource... [I believe]

And, the patent could be expired one year ago, but I think that the
kernel hackers use this format before this year: the kernel 2.4.23 has
the logo.gif, so I think that we can check easyly that the series 2.4.x
used (and uses) this format.
