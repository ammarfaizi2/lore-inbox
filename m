Hi,

You have seen some implementations by Stingr to linux-2.4. Now it's 
getting even more serious.

Some people say they had hacks for kbuild-2.5. I'm quite satisfied with 
the new kbuild, so if you have your hacks saved somewhere, please send 
them to me! I'll eval them and see if they're useful.

It all ends up in either a big mess or a cleaner tree which even Linus 
might accept.

Regards,
Thunder
