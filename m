Have you heard anything about when Linus intends to code freeze?  In my 
planning I am assuming Sept. 30 is way earlier than 2.6 would ship.  I 
remember how long 2.4 took, and I simply assume 2.6 will be the same. 
 At any rate, there is no way we'll be done earlier than September: it 
is a deep rewrite.  Code looks so much better than the old code...., but 
it is completely new code.
