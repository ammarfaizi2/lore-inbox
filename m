Hi all,

While I've been compiling and thinking about running 2.5.x on my home
system, I finally got what I thought was a good build out of 2.5.8p2
and I booted up.  It came up fine, but it locked up completely when I
did anything with xmms beyond starting it up and letting it play.

I used the attached config to build the kernel, both with and without
Pre-emption enabled, since I figured that might be the problem.  I'm
still using the modules.conf file from my 2.4.18p7rmap12a (which was
up and stable for 67+ days, good work Rik and crew!) install, which is
a RedHat 7.2 based system (upgraded from 7.1), along with my own
random upgrades of stuff.  

I did compile in both ALSA and OSS, so I suspect I'm running into some
sort of conflict there.  Unfortunately, there's nothing in the logs to
say why the system locked up, and I don't have a serial console on the
system.  Nor did I get any type of Oops.  

My system is a dual processor Dell Precision 610MT, PIII Xeon 550mhz,
768mb of RAM, AGP Matrox G450 32mb, Intel Etherpro (builtin ethernet
doesn't work reliably) and builtin CS4236+ sound.  

Please let me know if I can give you any more info.

John
