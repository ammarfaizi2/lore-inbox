Dear Friend,
My name is Rosemary williams, a staff in my bank. I have this urgent 
deal
to transact with you if you can do it. There is an unclaimed deposited
fund of $15 Million in the name of Smith Shaw with no traceable 
address.
This fund has stayed over 10years in the bank without a claimant.
Professionally, any unclaimed money for a period exceeding 10 years is
recovered by the bank.
I being in the position of the file wants any foreign partner to 
assume
the next of kin of the late Smith Shaw and write to the Union Bank 
Plc for claims.I will advice you adequately on how to do it when I 
hear from you. Bear in mind that I will stand as a neutral body to 
the whole transaction. You will only be dealing with any attorney we 
choose. 
Your compensation has been taken into consideration as the account 
provider. To be precise, your share is 20% of the Total amount. Any 
financial assistance we receive from you will be re-inbursed 
immediately the fund gets into your account.
I am willing to give you the details of the money and the way we can
execute the deal successfully but let me see the desire from you 
first.
