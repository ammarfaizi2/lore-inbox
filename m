Well, the point is that no kernel developer is watching and working on
low-latency fixes regulariy for 2.6 kernels, as Andrew did for every
2.4 release.  And, the users can't report easily what gets wrong.
(If the report were something like '2.6.x worked but 2.6.y not', it
 would be easy to figure out, but many users experience this problem
 between 2.4 and 2.6...)

Maybe this situation can be improved by enabling the xrun_debug proc
switch on ALSA, which shows the stack trace when a buffer
over/underrun happens.  Also, running a latencytest program would be
helpful for spotting out the problem.


BTW, 2.6 kernel works pretty well on my system.  Perhaps it's because
I run jackd directly as root.

I've also heard some people complaining after replacement with 2.6,
too, but I believe it's either driver-specific problem or a bug caused
by the NPTL incompatibility reported on this thread.
AFAIK, there are still some problematic parts, for example, a long
lock in shrink_dcache_parent(), and too-long RCU jobs in a tasklet,
but they are relatively minor.

The problem is the incompatibility between NPTL and LinuxThreads.
As Paul pointed, if calling pthread_setschedparm() has no influence
_after_ creating the thread, it sounds like a bug to me.  This might
be a problem of glibc, not of kernel.  We don't know even it. 

Anyway, we'll need a small testcase to reproduce this problem...
