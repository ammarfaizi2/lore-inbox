In California, USA:

There is no such thing as a free lunch, even as an employer.

A clause of that sort it technically unenforceable.

However, due to a broken tort system, there is an indirect way for
an employer to enforce such a clause.   However, this same strategy
works whether you signed such an agreement or not and whether 
such a clause exists or not, thus this risk isn't directly related
to the issue.

The bottom line being that having or not having such a clause
in your contract won't change your liability (at least in California).
