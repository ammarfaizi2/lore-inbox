Dear Satish,

What you means by "segmentation fault on my linux m/c" ?

Segmentation fault is coming from your applications or from Linux Packages
or from Linux kernel ?

BTW, segmentation fault indicates an improper memory access , A common cause
for a segmentation fault is an attempt to access an array out of bounds.

Jaswinder.
