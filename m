Conspiracy theorists may suggest I had this planned when I convinced
you to push the split-up work. Heh.. Excellent 8-)

Truth be told though, despite agpgart having a maintainer, and Jeff
popping up on dri-devel once a month or so, it's pretty much been
hacked on by everyone and his dog since Jeff last touched it, so
I don't think you have too much to worry about by being "it" 8-)
