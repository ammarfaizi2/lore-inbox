That would be a retroactive redef on the part of AMD; it probably makes 
sense for x86-64 if someone thinks that is may drop support for 4 MB 
pages at some point in the distant future.  Still, I'm not sure Intel 
would agree with the definition as stated, although I haven't looked in 
the docs.

This is all extremely theoretical, since there has never been a chip 
with PAE=1 and PSE=0, and I wouldn't expect one to appear any time soon.
