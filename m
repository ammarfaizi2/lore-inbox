A couple days ago when I stumbled onto this discussion, I was prompted 
to at least post an opinion from a user perspective. Having followed 
along since then, I am beginning to wonder why I am so interested in 
the Linux community in the first place. I have to admit, my chin is 
still on the floor having read some of the personal attacks directed 
towards Marc. Why, for some, has this become a personal issue and not a 
technical one? I think Marc summed it up best (a few times) by saying:

>> I repeat, the \0 is purely a technical workaround, done without any 
mischievous intent.

Can't we respect this as his explanation and move on so these efforts 
can be better directed towards improving the kernel? Hell - Marc has 
alot of work to-do in order for driverloader to be compatible with 4K 
stacks ;)  (BTW I have no idea how you can support Fedora but it is 
appreciated.) There seems to be a couple posters here that understand 
why this workaround was done and agree that there needs to be a better 
way than seeing repeated "tainted" messages. In my opinion, this is the 
perspective that should have been taken from the start. Or at least 
once the list realized the intent and received Marc's appologies.

P.S. Thanks to those who offered your opinions in agreement with mine 
via email but not on the list.

Respectfully,
Keith
