Sadly, I've heard statements like this before; I've even made them :-).
If it were a choice between AOL/Time Warner/Red Hat and not working on
Linux, would you still make that choice? If it were a choice between
working for AOL/Time Warner/Red Hat or working for Red Hat and competing
with AOL/Time Warner/Mandrake, would you still make that choice? The
world of business, where money talks, presents us with interesting
choices from time to time :).
