Its trivial. IPv4 or IPv6 it takes a couple of minutes of fiddling from
a suitably connected point. I wouldnt actually bother with that anyway,
the people who maintain web cache logs are normally paid so little that
$1000 for running a provided script really would be less hassle for your
budding organised criminal or government agent.

There is no difference in the security between IPv4 and IPv6. None at
all.
