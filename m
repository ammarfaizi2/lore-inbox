Does anyone else get immediate Aiii's when you unplug the cable, while
capturing video? (xawtv)

The camera is actually a L'espion, a sub-entry level digital camera,
with the main distinguising feature that it's largest dimension is the
length of the AAA battery that powers it.

Unfortunately, the attempt at recording and later transcribing this from
images failed due to a bad battery in the aforementioned camera.
