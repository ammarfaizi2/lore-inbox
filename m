Indeed. Those people don't realise that their "copyright" law is different to 
the almost the rest of the world. In most of Europe there in no "The 
Copyright", but "authors' or moral rights" ("derechos de autor", "droit 
d'auteur") and "exploitation rights" (or economic rights). Author/moral 
rights cannot be jeopardized. And authors don't _have_ to register their work 
to claim it's theirs or to win in court. 

About registration, the copyright rule in Alan's country (Copyright, Design 
and Patent Act, DCPA 1998, UK):

- Requires _no_ registration.
- Arises as soon as the work is _produced_.
- Cost _nothing_ to obtain protection.
- Lasts 70 years in EU.
