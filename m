Agreed.  What we need is funding for the development of those
things which aren't already taken care of by the community.

In the areas where open source software is doing well, there
already is funding by interested parties (companies, government,
universities, ...).

Some other areas won't ever get the funding through donations,
simply because people will freeload whenever they can and try
funding development as much as they can.  We've seen that with
BitKeeper and you had to "tighten up" the license a bit in order
to make sure development stayed funded.

In short, I believe the voluntary donations aren't needed in
most areas people would donate to and won't make enough of an
impact in the areas where they are needed.

Rik
