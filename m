Subject: ANNOUNCE: Web100 Alpha 1.0 Kernel Patch & Userland

The Web100 Project would like to announce the release of its Alpha
1.0 software, the first public release of software through the project.
The software is available off our project web site (http://www.web100.org).

In short, the Web100 project aims to develop the tools needed to allow
network users to transparently achieve high bandwidth data rates over
networks. 

The Web100 software implements a set of instrumentation in the TCP/IP
stack of an operating system. The software is divided up into two, 
separate pieces: 
	1. A patch to the Linux kernel, which is responsible for
	   exposing the data collected by the instrumentation. 
	2. A shared library with a set of utilities (the userland), which
	   allows the easy reading and manipulation of these instruments. 

In addition to the software release, Web100 programmers continue to refine
TCP software so that users can automatically achieve the highest possible
transfer rate. This effort has already led to a first draft of a new
Internet Engineering Task Force standard 
(http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mathis-rfc2012-extension-00.txt). 
As the development of new standards progresses, Web100 researchers hope
that other operating system vendors will adopt the Web100 enhancements.
Such changes will make increased TCP traffic flows easier to handle and
more transparent for the users of high-speed networks.

The Web100 Project welcomes any comments or questions! Please feel free to
