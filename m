It seems to me that what would be even better than patches is a
general awareness of bloat and an attitude discouraging adding any
bloat whatsoever to the base kernel. Proactive bloat prevention is a
much better solution than asking embedded developers to send fixes
whenever someone increases the size of the core kernel unnecessarily.
Let's prevent a Mozilla here.
