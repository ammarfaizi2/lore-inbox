I think Nigel already said that this went wrong, agreed. However, I
remember that this was discussed a lot earlier and Suspend 2 was just
not acceptable for the mainline, so work was done to get it acceptable.

But however, that is really not the point. I would like to go on and
solve the issues with the current problems, and not to start from the
beginning just because of mistakes that were made in the past.

Regards,
Matthias
