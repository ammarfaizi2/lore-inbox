You want to do it on trigrams (groups of three works). Anything longer
than trigrams is not likely to be effective.

I'm doing language modeling in school, and generating text that "looks
like meaningfull" to everyone but human is too easy.

[Take your favourite voice-recognition software, and speak in another
language to it. It will generate plausible-looking sentences at the
