Greetings Ralph,

I think that the "research" you have been doing was a clear waste of time
of people at Amstrad who were, as it turns out, not even breaking any 
laws.

Alan Cox has cleared up everything, and so your best option, I think, is
to kindly apologize to Amstrad for wasting their time and not continue
with your irritating "what if this" and "what if that"s, unless you are a 
lawyer and therefore delight in the waste of time of this sort (or even 
paid to do that).

Having said that, I also saved your first email in the "useful" folder --- 
as a classical example of what to expect from someone with little clue but 
much "zeal" for the enforcement of GPL putting his nose in every hole he 
can find :)

Kind regards
Tigran
