Hi all,

I am a newbie to Linux Kernel Development, with a very basic knowledge of C, 
and an OK knowledge of C++/Qt.

I was wondering if the people on this list could help me with my learning of 
C, and help me and bring me up to Kernel Developer status.

Looking through the source code, there are a lot of "printk"s. I believe that 
this is an alternative to printf because printf was unsuitable for this 
purpose, and that it was written by Linus Torvalds, but I don't see why 
printf's not adequate.

I also would like to know about the Linux security model, as well as what 
ELF/a.out is.

Many thanks,

George
