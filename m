That's nice.  For $800/year, anyone can join who is interested, provided
they can attend the meetings.  Anyone is free to join and ask questions on
the T13 mailing list.

As to the "facts," I guess I choose to believe myself, since I'm one of the
guys writing firmware that decides drive behavior in many of these cases
that people bring up.  Now, I've only been doing this for 3 years, so if
there was something done greater than 3 years ago, odds are I haven't heard
of it.  I am only speaking from recent experience.

As to "believing" Andre, I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he comes off as
awefully bitter... it's tough to read more than a few sentences of what he
writes.  He obviously "knows" stuff, but wants to make people jump through
hoops to learn what he knows.

Of course, you can dismiss everything I'm saying if you like.  However, I'd
like to think I've been helpful to someone.  Disk drives don't work quite
the way some people think, so I like to try to clear up these misconceptions
thinking it will eventually help produce better linux code that works better
with the IDE drives I can afford.
