Hi!

Is there someone out there, with sharp zaurus sl-5500, willing to test
kernels? There's a linux-z tree on kernel.org, which I try to more or
less keep in sync with mainline, that is slowly starting to get
usable. It could use some testing.

Main drawback is that battery charging is not yet done; touchscreen is
there but I did not have chance to test it with proper userspace
filtering.
