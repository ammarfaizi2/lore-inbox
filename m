I apologise for not contributing to that effort, however I was expecting
to be able to plug the deliverables of it into this framework. I hope to
participate in as many of these subsystem virtualisation discussions as
I can, but at that time it looked like there was enough input going in.

Sure, this is where we came to last time. I agree that it is an
optimisation, but not just an implementation optimisation.

In the abstract sense you have tuples of (task, namespace) for each type
of namespace. However for (task, utsname) this is a much weaker thing to
want per-process, and much more like you want it per process family. So,
it is also a design optimisation. Some tuples really are (family,
namespace) in the first instance.

Some of them influence behaviour in fastpath code. For instance, one
example of a flag is the scheduling policy. A process family might have
a flag set on it to group its scheduling together, to provide assertions
like "this family should get Â¼ of the CPU". Clearly userspace can't make
this call. But perhaps I don't get your meaning.

I think they are a pragmatic necessity.

Sure, you might set a flag on a process family to allow family_id values
to be rewritten on the system/user barrier.

Sometimes you might not know of any particular processes in the family.
Maybe it's got one process that is just doing "while (1) { fork && exit
}". How do you "catch" it ?

So, you're breeding and selecting the horse. Fine, can't I start nailing
together the frame for the cart, and tanning the leather for the bridle?
Surely whichever horse we end up with, we'll still need a cart. And
don't forget the stables, too. We've got a lot of stables already, so we
know roughly what size the cart needs to be. Surely we won't want people
knocking those down and rebuilding them.

I'm just a bit concerned about this merging effort turning into a
research project. I'd rather try and merge the approaches used by
systems people are currently using than try to come up with something
wildly new.

After all, if the new developments are that flexible, they should be
easily able to support the presented interfaces ranging from the circa
1999 FreeBSD jail() to a more modern vserver/container/openvz/etc API.
