Hi Hiro, 

I am the maintainer of the 2.5 status page.  There is an explanation of
what alpha, beta, etc. mean if you go to http://kernelnewbies.org/status/
and click on the link at the bottom.
The project status usually reflects what the project maintainer told me
or just my best guess, so take it with a grain of salt  :-)  
This page is for information purposes only.

One more thing I should reiterate: it's not because an item is on this 
list that it will be included in 2.5.  In fact, I expect many items in 
there to never make it into 2.5.  What goes in is ultimately Linus' 
decision.

Actually, it'd be fun to have a contest (now that we are at the 
beginning of the 2.5 series) to see what people think are the items the 
least likely to get in!
