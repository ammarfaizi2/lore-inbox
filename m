Hi folks, I am looking to programatically pull the latest snapshot of
the bitkeeper repository on a daily basis, and also track all changes
to the tree.  I downloaded BitKeeper and was wondering how I configure
it to achieve this.  I dont need specific commands, I can look those
up myself in the documentation, I am looking for configuration
settings.

TIA!

Cheers,
