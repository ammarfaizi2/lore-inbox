Well, I'm thinking about buying a new board with Intel E7205 Chipset. I found 
a small hint in the archive of this list, that only AGP 3.0 is under 
development. So, am I right, that there is support for
- Silicon Image 3112 S-ATA controller
- RealTek ALC650 Sound
- Broadcom 5702 Gigabit LAN
- TI TSB43AB22 FireWire
In which kernel-tree do I find support for those controllers?
Are there any tricks using this hardware?

thanks

Chris
