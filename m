didn't need to. already told you what size the bare
bones 2.5 is, and I doubt it will get any smaller. au

oh, but it is! even using your own explanation: why
does it make sense to avoid upgrades on those old
systems? because those are better without, otherwise
it would make sense to upgrade. so the old stuff
performs better (whatever that means) on those old
systems than the new one. q.e.d.

not to mention that "active maintenance" of the old
kernels doesn't really save you from upgrades... just
upgrades to the "new and improved" kernel...
