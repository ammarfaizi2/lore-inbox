It's somewhere in the scanning code.  There's a case where it runs off 
the end of the stack.  Check the compaq drivers for SATA as well, they 
also crash in a similiar place during bus scan.  Both occurred during 
bootup, so I wasn't able to get a log of the particulars.  Should be 
easy to reproduce.  Compaq Presario 2200.
