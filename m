Larry, sorry, but this is pure bs.

If a company survives has absolutely _zero_ to do with commercial or
non-commmercial give-away of products. Example: mysql, it's all about service
and none about selling a product.

And to give an example seen from another side:
I have a paper hanging on the wall, writes:

"What do you mean? We are a multi billion dollar company."

It was emailed to me years ago by someone from middle management from Commodore
International as an answer to a my complaint that exactly this management is
producing big bs in designing their product portfolio. 1,5 years later the
company was dead.
There is nothing like a guaranteed life for a company, no matter what it
_sells_. One thing that is heavily underestimated by analysts of all kinds is
that a company has _no_ life of its own. It is run by people, and _these_ are
important, and not the company, be it big or small.

Regards,
Stephan
