Hi,

I am a PhD student and need to profile the activity of the IEEE 802.11
wireless network card in Linux. The basic idea is to monitor when the
pcmcia wireless card is sending, receiving, or idle. I am using
Redhat 8.0 with kernel 2.4.18.

Would you give me some suggestions on if there is such profiling tool?
Otherwise, I think I need to modify the wireless driver. Is there any link
on
how to modify the wireless driver?

Thanks and appreciate your help.
