Hi,

During boot services are being started and 'devfsd', the first service,
does not finish on recent 2.5 kernels. 

My devfsd version is: v1.3.25
(Which works fine with 2.4.x kernels.)

I have tried earlier 2.5 kernels like 2.5.2 but they had 'other
problems'. 

2.5.6-dj2 seemed to work fine. 
(I ran into other problems regarding my mouse but that is another
story..)

2.5.7-vanille: devfsd does not finish
2.5.7-dj1: devfsd does not finish
2.5.7-dj2: devfsd does not finish

Attached you will find my config file.

Yours,
Luuk van der Duim
