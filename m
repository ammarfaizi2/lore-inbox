Hi Eric,

Sorry I did not get that. This patch has been posted twice on mailing list.
First by you and now second time by me. Are you saying that original post
did not had whitespace damage and now second post has got? (May be I 
goofed up while forward porting, though I can't spot the whitespace damage).

Thanks
Vivek
