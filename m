Hello,

I don't want to be flamed. I know this question has been raised before
but I haven't been able to find an answer looking at the mail archives.

Why does 2.5.24 break applications like Evolution 1.0.7 or Ximian Gnome
Control Center 1.5.13? In both cases, using some functionality that
spawns new processes causes both applications to hang up. Has anyone
discovered the cause for this? Do you think it will be fixed soon? I'm a
little worried about this.

Sincerely,

	Felipe Alfaro Solana
