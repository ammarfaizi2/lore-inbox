Andrew and Marcelo do an excellent job.  I have never said otherwise
nor attempted to infer that.

The reasons that we need patches are mostly the same as other distributions:

1. Our release schedule is different from the vanilla kernels.

When we release a kernel based on a vanilla release there may be bug
fixes that are going to be in the next vanilla release that we can
apply straight away.

2. Our goals are different from the vanilla kernel.

Some issues are not critical to the vanilla kernel, e.g., IDE modules
but are release-critical for us.

3. Licensing problems.

This is specific to Debian.  For anything to be included in our release,
it has to pass the DFSG.  The vanilla kernel does not have this
restriction so we may need to remove bits before it's suitable for us.

Cheers,
