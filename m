I'm essentially paraphrasing an opinion I had access to at one time, from 
one of the largest IP law specialist firms in our part of the world.

I'm not a lawyer myself, but that does convey accurately the sense of what 
I was told.  I suspect the US may be more 'much weaker' than 'slightly 
weaker', given the context of the original.

And that's about all I can think of to say about this.  Please don't think 
I'm being evasive, it's just that I perhaps sounded surer that I should, 
and I certainly omitted the IANAL.  Also, the opinion I'm paraphrasing was 
mostly not about software copyright, so this is about all it said that was 
relevant.

One thing I do have in mind is to dig around in the headers etc. and see 
what I can find as to (implicit or explicit) license declarations.  That 
may not be a priority, as I have no intention of writing non-GPL kernel 
code myself anytime soon, I'm more curious and would like to see the issue 
sorted out.

Andrew
