tuning ac97_quirk option will help.
(perhaps ac97_quirk=1)

these messages appear sometimes on some via boards.
i don't figure out yet what's wrong.  it's often harmless.

dxs_support option is irrelevant with the mixer configuration.
it's for PCM set up.  check whether 44100Hz playback works with
dxs_support=1.  if it's ok, please let us know the pci subsystem id,
so that it will be enabled as default.
