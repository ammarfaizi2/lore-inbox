Hi all!
	I am not sure if this a bug, but when I try to boot kernel 2.4.18
it stops just before init starts. It doesnt hang because ctrl+alt+del does
reboot the system. I tried kernels with 386 and cyrix processors but with
the same result.
	During the booting process it does give

Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 2d
Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?

Does this have anything to do with the booting problem.

I would appreciate any pointers or suggestions ...

Thank you for your time.

-Pranav
