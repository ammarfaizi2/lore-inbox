I just came across a very good page on exactly the same issue.  Have a look

Subject: IDE RAID Hardware Advice


I'll be assembling a terabyte of IDE RAID network attached storage,
and was looking for some advice on:

  - best supported and most reliable multi-channel IDE controller;

  - best supported and most reliable NFS implementation;

  - any other random advise about things to do or not do in setting up
    this type of system.
