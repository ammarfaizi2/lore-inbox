	Perfect.  :-)

	It's what we, sometimes, refer to as "rubber hose security"
and what Bruce Schneier has been heard to refer to as "rubber hose
cryptography".  You grap someone and beat the #$@#$# out of them with
a rubber hose till they tell you what they want to know.  The BEST we
can hope for is to raise the secuity to the point where they (whoever
"THEY" are) can do no better than that.  :-/  If we HAVEN'T raised it
that far, we still have more we can, and should, do.
