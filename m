It also looked to me like Rik was talking about the mainline VM, not
any VM that exists in the many not-yet-integrated -aa patchsets.

The argument always feels to me like:

Joe Luser: "I downloaded a 2.4 kernel and boy does the VM bite!"  

AA: "That's not true at all, but you need to apply these thirteen -aa
     patches from my site."  

Joe Luser: <runs away in fear>
