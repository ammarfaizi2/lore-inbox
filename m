You're right that my opinions are irrelevant. 

However, if you are right in thinking that you're affected by the DPA,
then my request as a 'data subject' that you correct your copy of my
personal information would be entirely relevant, and you would be
legally obliged to obey.

Russell, you took a patch which I had Cc'd to you merely as a courtesy,
mangled the attribution and passed it on, despite the fact that I had
previously asked you not to do so.

When I asked you again not to do that, you were abusive. I'm sorry if
you feel that asking Linus not to apply such things isn't civilised --
but I did ask you politely first, only to receive an abusive reply:

<dwmw2_gone> rmk: I know your policy and that's why I sent the patch to
    akpm instead of to you. I Cc'd you as a courtesy. Yet you still
    mangled the attribution and sent my patch on.
<dwmw2_gone> So... are you going to refrain from doing that in future,
    or am I going to stop Ccing you?
<rmk> dwmw2: oh fuck you, sorry.  I'm really not in the mood for your 
    bloody mindedness.

All you needed to say was "OK, then I won't apply your patches".
