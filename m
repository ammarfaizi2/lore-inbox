It's already happening.  You have no idea how much spam I've
received "from" Ingo Molnar, Bill Davidsen, Stephen Tweedie
and you ...

You probably also have no idea from which countries the spam
with you in the From: address has been sent ;)

Recently an anti-spam mailinglist (with members-only posting)
got flooded by a spammer who wanted to take revenge for his
N-th cancelled account.  Of course he used From: headers with
the addresses of many of the list regulars.

cheers,

Rik
