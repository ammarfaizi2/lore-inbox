To all long suffering users,

I have just compiled linux-2.6.0-test11-bk6 (this has the SMI correction). 
 This "seams" to
fix the the locking problem but only time will tell for sure.  I have not 
applied any of the
APIC patches and I'm getting very high error counts (presumably because 
the interval timers
are playing up).  For example the IRQ0/LOC count is ~ 6M the ERR is ~ 1M. 
Below is a dump
of various details.  I can provide more if necessary.  I do have a couple 
of questions about
interval timers.

1. It is necessary to have both the APIC timer and the 8254 timer running 
simuntanously.
2. Can the 8254 timer be disabled if the APIC timer is running.
3. What stops each timer interrupting each other.

Cheers,

Ross
