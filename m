   Note that the manual says that the device will not use DAC if higher 32
   bits are zero. Nor I remember of any errata about the device behaving
   this way. But, as sym53c8xx device actually trying to do 64 bit PCI
   addressing should have been pretty rare for now, not all errata on this
   point should have been discovered (just trying to guess ...).

If I do not set DDAC in sym53c8xx it issues DAC cycles for everything,
even addresses with no bits set in upper 32-bits of address.

You will remember, we had this issue long ago and had to add #define
for it (which dies in my pci64 changes becuase this portability
issue no longer exists with proper API present).

Later,
