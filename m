Hi all,

	A good spot o' webtrawling has left me with the impression that Rik
Riel is Linux's only hope of ever competing with FreeBSD on large jobs
other than dbench.

	Is this true? Judging by the ease with which AA's hackwork made it into
2.4, I think we may all be, well, fucked.

	I wonder if Linus has booted 5-CURRENT lately.

	Alarmed,

	Duraid.
