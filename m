Now just a cotton-picken minute. When was the last time you
accessed that site? I spent most of last night looking through
EMPTY directories with files that are invisible to ftp but
(sometimes) show with their `ls`, and never with nlist.

Maybe you can still download stuff if you are running from a
Web Crawler, but it doesn't work with `ftp` anymore.
