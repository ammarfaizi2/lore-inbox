Richard, I fully agree with you that coding style is very personal and
everyone is trying to prove that one style is better than onther one is
very likely dumb.
Nevertheless you've to agree that having a common coding style inside a
project "helps" lesser the fatigue the brain has to sustain to "parse" the
code.
Even if my "native" coding style is slight different from the lk I'm very
happy to work on a project that has a common style, don't you agree ?
