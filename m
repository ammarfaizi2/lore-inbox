Hi,
        I know my problem is the options I selected for compiling my
kernel are not correct. I am having a difficult time trying to find the
correct option to solve this one. Can somebody help? The error message I
get during start up is:
Starting sound driver: snd-card-es1938 modprobe: Can't locate module
snd-card-es
 done
My sound card is an ESS Solo1, built on to the motherboard.
Thank you in advance.
Kendrick Hamilton
