Greetings,

I have an Adaptec 21610SA raid card. If I have understood things 
correctly, I should be using the aacraid module, however it hangs the 
machine as soon as the module is loaded. I am using 2.4.29-pre3.

I have looked at the Adaptec supported drivers. These seem to be a set 
of patches to various kernels. but not to the later ones.

Does anybody have this card working? Thanks.
