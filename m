If you've been involved in any design sessions with Linus - if you could even 
grace them with that name - you know he relies way more on intuition than 
process.  Actually, far from taking the role of the omniscient creator, he 
tends to act more like the survival test.  Not that he's short of the 
necessary skills to do it your way.  I think he does it the way he does it 
because it's fun and interesting and, oh yes, effective.
