Well no that's OK, and no hard feelings. I think there was a bit
of misunderstanding on my behalf as well :)

And I perhaps didn't make it so clear that I was taking a neutral
stance, and not actually commenting on the patch specifically.

Well I think obviously any improvement in Linux's capability is a
good thing. And at the end of the day it sounds like most or maybe
all this stuff should be able to get included. But it is always
going to be a slow process, and you'll probably have to put up with
some flames along the way :P

Well I'll be quiet now, unfortunately I didn't add much to the
discussion myself!
