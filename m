I have not seen much complaints over kbuild-2.5, and what I have seen
(i.e. it was slower) Keith has done a very good job of addressing (i.e.
now it is faster).  Whatever items come up in the future, I suspect
Keith is committed to fixing.  Right now, however, it is certainly hard
for him to maintain kbuild-2.5 against a moving kernel tree and work on
new features.  Keith knows I will stop sending him Christmas cards if
kbuild-2.5 was merged and he did not follow up on issues - I suspect
that will not happen. :)

Fwiw, I like kbuild-2.5 and want it in.

Probably not.  Like most of the noise on lkml these days, non-developers
seem to have an opinion on everything yet offer little value.  Code
talks and ...
