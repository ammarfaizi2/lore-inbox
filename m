Hi All
I installed RH 7.2 on a dual PIII serverworks mother board box. It has a
promise SX6000 card and it was working fine. Then I decided to upgrade the
kernel to the new version 2.4.18. I down loaded the sources and compiled the
I2O support as modules. Did the installation of the kernel and the machine
does not find the I2O card as before and hangs at finding new hardware. Can
anybody please tell me what I did wrong. And point me to where I can find an
I2O howto.
Thank You
Raj
