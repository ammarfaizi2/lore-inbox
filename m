Jeff, they don't force you, they require it to be turned over to them
for inclusion in the FSF proper upstream source. Also, it doesn't mean
that you lose your rights to the original piece. You can still reuse
your own source as the copyright owner.

That doesn't stop things like egcs from happening, does it? It's not
like Apple's old license that the mere releasing of your patches to the
source requires turning over non-exclusive rights.

I really hope I didn't help this thread diminish into a licensing
flamefest.
