You are free to not apply the GPL to it.

However, then you cannot legally copy it at all, because it contains
part of the original author's copyrightedwork and therefore can only
legally be copied with the permission of the author.

                         learned early in marriage by internists' wives, but

         better by themselves. Most things, in fact, are better by morning."
