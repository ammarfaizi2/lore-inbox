Hi,
I'm buying a production server for webservices for mobile operators.

My HW provider suggested Abit's KR7A-133R (ATA133)  with HPT372.

Is this motherboard already fully supported and when will stable kernel be
ready for production use on these motherboards? (btw - any advice on good
amd combo is appreciated)

Thank you for your help and I'd appreciate a personal cc: cos I'm not a
member of this list.

Thanx!
Vasja
