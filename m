I'd probably have left it where it was and had a one-line patch just
which made it static, to keep the size of the patch down and avoid
conflicts with people trying to add new chip idents -- but since I don't
want people adding new chip idents anyway I suppose that's fine.

True. Thanks.

It's not converting to QP for me. My response to you, for example,
returned via lkml with...
	Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
	Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Er, on further investigation it seems that Evolution actually _sent_ it
QP, and it got converted _from_ QP to 8-bit somewhere en route. That's
just bizarre.
