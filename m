With such a subject, you'll certainly feed most people's spam traps. And
with such a fuzzy question, I don't think you'll ever get a useful response.
It's like asking what is the difference between sunny days and rainy days...

You'd better look for some litterature if your question is related to kernel
development, eg. Linux Device Drivers from Alessandro Rubini.
