Nonsense.  This isn't closed source issue at all because the issue is the
CVS gateway.  You don't need source to write that gateway and you could
have (and recall that Linus said you should have) written the gateway 
yourself, hosted it yourself, and maintained it yourself.

There are no closed source issues here, you're just trying to redirect 
attention there because it meets your agenda.  Nice try but no dice.

Since we are providing something that you want, you asked for, and you
could have built yourself, you get it under our terms.  Which are "shut
the heck up already, you got what you wanted."
