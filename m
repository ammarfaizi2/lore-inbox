I have a 16mb Stmart Media Card included with the pack.

Can you possibly suggest any card readers that *will* work on Linux =>
2.4.18 (ie use a specific type, usb, serial) and do they have to be
compatible with specific memory cards?

Sorry to sound vague, but I've never used one before.

Just fishing :-)..I do a google...

And if so any chance of a few quick links on getting the memory card
readers to work?
(don't worry too much about that, I just figured if you know any that
were maybe bookmarked)
