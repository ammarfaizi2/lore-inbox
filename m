Not so, I personally have a SCSI Plextor burner, and at work we have 
several different other brands of SCSI burners, I also have a few friends 
who have SCSI burners (the majority have IDE burners, but there are a few 
with SCSI).
And personally I'm buying a new SCSI burner if this one dies, I've never 
had a burner as troublefree as this one. IDE burners are no longer for me.
