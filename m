For me at least  the nvidia driver substantially increased effort involved 
in dealing with a driver thats internals are not openly available, in 
boxes the test lots of kernels. notwithstanding that I still have two them. 

When dealing with laptops and apm/acpi issues I'd vastly prefer to have a
radeon mobility m7 in the box than virtually anything else, and rv200s
have in general been extremely easy for us to support among our users
given the integration of their drivers.
