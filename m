I am having the problem using kernel 2.4.26 and also 2.6.2 that all
my drives are detected as udma33  whereas two of them are actually
100 or 133.  This did not happen on a previous motherboard with the
via chipset.  The board is a Shuttle computer an50r with an Athlon 64
cpu.

Any assistance would be appreciated.
