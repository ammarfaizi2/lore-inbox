The two branches of the USA that pertain have now confirmed that Microsoft
is a problem requiring an externally asserted solution, but the judicial
branch has rejected the specific solution proposed by the executive
branch. Three other proposed remedies are mentioned in the Washington Post
today. One involves allowing developers access to Microsoft sourcecode
equally. One involves allowing computer vendors to configure the Microsoft
software as they see fit. The third involves unbundling software from the
OS. Gates had stated, correctly, that the split of the company proposed by
DOJ did not reflect any understanding of the software business. Looking at
the three subsequent proposals, it appears to me that this problem is
still searching for a solution. These three recent superficialities also
do not appear to be the ideas of people who know how these things work.
Meanwhile, Microsoft whole-heartedly engages in a depraved attack on the
copyright rights of individuals, making it delightfully clear that the
problem remains unsolved, and that Microsoft's general degradation of the
computer world continues unabated.
