On the 21th of June Linus said this in a message to linux-kernel:

"2.5.x looks like it will open in a week or two, so we're not talking about
long timeframes".

So he probably has plans to start 2.5.x soon (my personal guess is that
he'll do it at the same time as 2.4.8 is released, but that's just me:-)
