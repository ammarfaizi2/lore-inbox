I think those repositories are stable enough you can start to count on
them.  Sam and others have looked over their changes and think that 
the CVS tree has accurate data.

The CVS repository is at

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@kernel.bkbits.net:/home/cvs

and it has two top level directories, linux-2.4 and linux-2.5.
