I was refering to the BK docs, not CVS and yes, BK works disconected. Which 
was for me one of the important decision points in in switching ntfs driver 
development to it. Together with easy merging of new kernel releases, etc, 
etc...

Oh I wasn't refering just to you. I was refering to the "silently seething" 
kernel hackers you mentioned but refused to name...

You obviously didn't read my mail properly. )-:

It is an inconvenience having to go lookup some website instead of having 
the doc right there. What part of that do you not understand? Perhaps you 
have a 24x7 internet connection, many people don't. Perhaps this is a 
surpise to you? I have the luxury of living in college provided 
accomodation with local lan connections in place, but this summer I will 
have to move into my own accomodation and it is very well possible I will 
not be able to have 24x7 internet... (I will try to find accomodation where 
I can get a cable modem but it may not be feasible for financial reasons.) 
For anyone not connected to the net it would be an inconvenience to have to 
look up the net. I think that this is self-evident but you obvious don't 
think so...

Best regards,

Anton
