	Alan Cox (lots of stuff), Andre Hedrik (IDE), Rik van Riel
(VM) and William Lee Irwin (NUMA) are substantial contributors.  I'm
not a principal author or maintainer of any kernel component, but I've
submitted a number of patches over the years that are part of the
kernel.

	Speaking only for myself, Linus's gnu.misc.discuss posting was
not the understanding under which I contributed.  I don't know of
Linus ever claiming that others are required to also grant the
permission that Linus granted in his gnu.misc.discuss posting as a
condition of their code being integrated into the stock kernels.

	  If you look toward the bottom of the second web page that I
mentioned in my previous message
( http://www.gcom.com/home/support/whitepapers/linux-gnu-license.html ),
you'll see a statement from Alan Cox of June 7, 2001 making a similar
point.  Here is a URL for the lkml message that that page quoted:
