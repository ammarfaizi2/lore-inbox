Who's forgetting?  The scary part is that corporate fascism is
basically the political reality in the U.S. (who is pushing very hard
to export it to the rest of the world, for obvious reasons) today.
Note that SSSCA failed not because of any freedom concerns, but
because Microsoft and Intel didn't want the gov't to tell them what to
do.

I don't say this lightly.  However, I really think that the U.S. no
longer is classifiable as a democracy, but rather as a plutocracy.
