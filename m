Well, when the program crashes, you get to run it again under Linux
and Unix operating systems. Not so with Windows. With Windows, you
reinstall windows after first booting DOS from a floppy and using
DEBUG to clear out the partition information, otherwise the new
Windows installation won't boot. Microsoft "help" desk advises to
replace the disk when, in fact, the partition information has been
corrupted by Windows.

Competition isn't always good. There are people in the former
Soviet Union and in India who will gladly do your job. And, they
will do it just as well as you, perhaps even better. You get to
live where you have your own bathroom, but can't afford hot water
because you don't have a job. The people who now do your job
never had it so good. They have hot water for the first time in
their lives.

So, competition simply changes who has hot water.
