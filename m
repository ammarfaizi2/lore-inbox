Perhaps some command earlier is being rejected which causes this later
hardware reported error due to some setting being different? It could be
something like that, one thing is for sure - the error generated as
displayed _is_ a media error and it _is_ being generated by the
hardware.

Someone suggested logging possibly rejected commands, I think that would
be a good idea to try.
