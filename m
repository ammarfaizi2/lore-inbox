Dear 

Listen and read carefully, i have found seriousness in
you and that is why i have decided to involve you in
this transaction o.k , i am  a woman of substance and
of great importance to my nation and the society in
general. i wll not entertain any act of unseriousness
from you in this transaction o.k

you must take instructions from me at all time and for
security reasons you will only communicate me only by
my email for now o.k.

I,am Mrs LOUISA EJERCITOR ESTRADA , the wife of Mr
Joseph Estrada the former president of Philippine
located in the south east Asia. My husband was
presently impeached from office by a backed uprising
of mass demonstrators and the senate.                 
                                        
During my husband's regime as president of
Philippine, I realised US$120.5millions of dollars
from various contract projects I executed
successfully. I had planed to invest this money in 
real estate and industral production.                 
                                                      
Now i have used an NGO to move the money to a bank
in overseas, i want you to assist me transfer the
money to your bank account as the beneficiary because
i do not want the philippine government to trace  and
confiscate this one. they have confiscated all our
asset. This is the only money left for me and my
family o.k
Now if you agree, i will offer you 25% of the total
fund, and you must keep it very secret and
confidential o.k. There is no risk involved, all i
want from you is , your complete name, address, bank
particulars phone and fax numbers, company name if any
and you must be honest o.k
this money will be transfered to your account as soon
as you release this requirements o.k
i look forward to having a good relationship with
you o.k
regards,

Mrs Louise Estrade
