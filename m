I'm not a beginner to programming, been doing it since an early age. 
That said, I have very little experience of "pro" programming - I am 
still in full time education.
Still, it is definately a high target, and will take some time getting 
used to.

I wrote my first patch yesterday, very very basic but its a start! (just 
simply makes the usblp driver output its debug info into dmesg when 
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG is set).

I think thats where I'm heading, thanks for the advice.



Amir: Here are a few URL's I have stored for this topic. I have yet to 
study them in detail.
