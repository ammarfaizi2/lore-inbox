I like this idea a lot.

The other thing to keep in mind in the specific case of ATI and NVIDIA is 
that their competition is feirce and expensive. They somewhat depend
on consumers being willing to purchase a new graphics card every half
year to two years. The fact that they have both 'held the throne'
so to speak in terms of performance and might demonstrate that a
costly patent lawsuit would be a good thing for them to avoid -
because their competitor is literally breathing down their neck,
they could very much do without the distraction or the loss of funds.

Perhaps the way to go about this is to put a lot of applicable patents
in a pool. Join us and our patents will defend your newly opened
drivers from your competition's lawsuits. Oppose us, and we will make 
things very bad for you, giving your competition an opportunity to take
the lead again, and if they know what's good for them, beat you to
the punch with open drivers.

The key then is target one company at a time, because the time
and money they would waste defending themselves would likely do very
bad things to allowing their competitor to take a *big* lead. Hell,
wasn't 3dfx's fall from power partially related to IP suits? Or
did I just hear that somewhere? I don't recall.

Ah, what it's like to dream. :)
