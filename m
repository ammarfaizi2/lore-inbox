I don't know, as I said I didn't test kernel between 2.6.10 and 
2.6.11-rc3-mm1.
Sorry.
If I have time enough later, I can test 2.6.11-rc3.
Since I don't really know if it's the good place to talk about that, I decided 
to report this bug on bugzilla too. Maybe you can post your problem here :
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4171

Thanks.
