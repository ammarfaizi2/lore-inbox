Lee,

	Sorry, the problem is that this IS the main *issue*, if we can figure
this out, we can go from there and get this working.

Previous threads were related to the fact that we needed a developer or

This one is hopefully the last thread about this subject regarding
driver making.

Hopefully we can get an answer? ;-)
