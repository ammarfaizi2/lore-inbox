Hi,  im not sure if im emailing the right place but its  a start. I just
setup kernel 2.4.0 and well it doesnt boot.

it says " ok booting the kernel" then nothing happens on the screen, and
I hear no activity from the computer. I tried it several times following
the
instructions, I did make mrproper, etc, tired putting the source in a
different dir, etc. I remember to reinstall lilo, all the good stuff. Im
not sure whats wrong.


My system is 2 466 celerons, abtit bp6 , 128ram, voodoo 3 3000,  maxtor
hd, all custom built. Anyone have any ideas? thanks in advance.
