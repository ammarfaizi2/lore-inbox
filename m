I have been running 2.4.1 on 12 SMP machines with minimal problems.
All these machines are SCSI (no IDE is even enabled in the BIOS).
SCSI is aic7xxx and BusLogic. Network cards, 3c59x, eepro100, pcnet32.
All the machines are daily hard-at-word. One is our main name-server.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).
