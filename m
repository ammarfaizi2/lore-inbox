even more true these days with 2.5. Sometimes, you can
only rely on the poster to guess what version he's
talking about. Eg: at least when I see Linus, Jens or
Dave Jones, I assume it's about 2.5 before reading the
mail.

That's what regular posters tend to do :
"[PATCH-2.4]", "[BUG in 2.2.20]", or "[OT]"...
The problem is more about newcomers who don't know
about these posting rules.

sometimes, a 2.5 bug/fix may also affect 2.4, and this
is only told in the message body.
