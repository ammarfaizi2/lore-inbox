(Quoting from groklaw wrt that lawsuit:)

"The judge had a few descriptive words for Mr. Merkey, as you will note
 particularly in paragraph 123 - 125 of the Findings of Fact:

 124. In fact, however, Merkey is not just prone to exaggeration, he also
 is and can be deceptive, not only to his adversaries, but also to his
 own partners, his business associates and to the court. He deliberately
 describes his own, separate reality."

Meanwhile, life goes on as usual in the real world.

Oh, and if you happen to need any code I might have contributed to the
kernel, it's available under the GPL.  Only.
