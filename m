The sender confirmation form I got was in html, not from your mailer, 
but from the ISP's server, which would not deliver the message unless 
I did some sort of a click thru reply.  As many of these are scams 
designed to collect valid email addresses, and some will lead to 
phishing attacks, its something I've never, ever considered doing. 
SCP is IMO a solution in search of a problem.

In other words, talk to your ISP, and if some sort of SCP is in 
effect, see if they will shut it off, and then setup your own version 
of spamassassin or similar filter.

In other words, this is the only message you saw from me, which does 
not contain the answer to your original post, as best as I could 
answer it.  That I've been known to be erronious does occasionally 
happen though. :)

And, if you don't see this answer, it will be because I didn't do the 
dance to clear thru your server again.  In that event, you'll 
conclude I'm an outstanding jerk for not answering.  Yes, I've been 
that occasionally in my 70 years, usually after something like this 
pulls my trigger.

However, since your server probably won't let this reply through 
either, I've taken the liberty (excuse me please, list readers) of 
adding lkml back into the Cc: line.  Maybe you'll read it there 
eventually.
