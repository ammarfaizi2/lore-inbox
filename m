I guess he meant "a start".

Whatever, I think there are some problems with the current IDE 
development. Martin is possibly a good developer, but he doesn't always 
seem all that experienced regarding IDE. Also, he releases too many testal 
patches which simply aren't going to work. Unfortunately, Linus ate them 
at once, so we sometimes had deadly situations.

These facts make me think that Martin is probably not the best maintainer 
for it. He might be a good developer - whatever -, but what is worth, he's 
certainly not the best one when it comes to planning. Thus, I think the 
question is: will it be better for IDE if Martin has the lead, current 
situation, or if Martin can unfold all his powerfulness in testing while 
someone else takes up the pieces and makes IDE of it, planning what comes 
next?

I'm not proposing a Martin Dalecki frontend, I'm just propagating an 
election.
