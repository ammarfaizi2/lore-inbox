Here is the english version:

The new VM has better performance than the old VM for typical desktop systems ... but it fails horribly on more systems than the old VM. Redhat, for example, cannot ship the new VM in their distribution because it'll just fall apart for the database servers, some of their users run at least now my code is gone I no longer have to work together with Linus, which is a good thing ;)



As a little comment, I would like to avoid to talk about the bad taste 
and the poor style used to say those thing in this way.
If you just go to read lkml archive you can find tents of mail
of people who were just waiting for AA VM to solve the problems they have 
with their eavilly stressed DB (I am one of them). That is true for small dbs,
and huge dbs with some GB of RAM used.
So basically Ri's assertion is far from truth on many aspects.
