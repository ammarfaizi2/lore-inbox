Hey,
	The other day (some of you may remember), I emailed the list talking
about ethernet packet corruption.  Suck, don't it?  We came to the
conclusion that it could be a couple of items:
* bad hardware on my end
* bad firewall
* something else?

	Well, I was talking to a friend who JUST installed Linux on the
previous version of my laptop (2000 model instead of 2001).  He said he
downloaded the Java JDK about 20 times yesterday, and it was corrupted
all but the last time.
	How would I go about testing things out and figuring out which is the
bad component?

Thanks

Kevin Breit
