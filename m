Dear kernel mantainer,

 we experienced problems while booting with the new kernel 2.4.30 correctly downloaded from www.kernel.org.
We failed in the attempt of using the built-in driver to gain control of our Adaptec Serial ATA RAID 21610SA adapter.
After correct kernel loading, the system halted after depmod check before starting filesystem check.
We solved it downloading the current drivers from adaptec website at:
http://www.adaptec.com/worldwide/support/drivers_by_product.jsp?sess=no&language=English+US&cat=/Product/AAR-21610SA
and integrating the source bundle in place of the kernel scsi subdir scsi/aacraid/.

Specification of the processor is Dual XEON. RedHat 9.0 was installed in advance by using precompiled adaptec-provided drivers. Disks were formatted using ext3 fs.
lspci output follows. Diff on sources showed not really much effort is to be done to integrate the new peripheral in the kernel.

Glad to be of some help, if need were.
Thanks for your time and amazing work!
Best regards,

Dr. Michele Armano
