ALPHA BANK LONDON

RE:
TRANSFER OF 152,000,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

 I feel 
quite safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this 
medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you 
through it because it still remains the fastest medium of 
communication. However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, 
and it should be treated as such.At first I will like to assure you 
that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both parties.

 
IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT (ONEHUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION POUNDS 
STERLINGS) FROM OUR BANK HERE IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF 
CLEANORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER,

 a program 
leader who was believed to acquire the fund through his secret Crude 
Oil deal with the Former IRAQI Government.The deceased died with all 
the members of his family in an uto-accident in JUNE 23, 1999 without a 
WILL. The amount involved is [152,000,000.00 POUNDS STERLINGS]. 

I 
WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I 
DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE 
WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT 
BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING 
THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME 
DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. 
URGENTLY by Email.

Regards, 
MICHEAL
