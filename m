	On marc.theaimslist.com, the last posting before the four that
I find by searching for "Richard Stallman" in the author search back
on June 9th.

	If we were to apply as stringent a standard of germainness,
many other people would fail it long before Richard Stallman.  Even in
the very thread with which you request this filtering, you saw fit to
post a response soley to participate in joking with someone about
Richard Stallman running for office.

	By the way, I chanced on a purely technical lkml article from
Richard on September 5, 2000, about suspending notebook computers at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=96819134426068&w=2, so
even if we were to accept your standard of "on topic", your
statement that Richard has "so far posted only offtopic to this list,
and that's what pisses me off" would still apparently be incorrect.

	I think the standard for filtering that you advocate at this
point is too one-sided and arbitrary.  It will do more to undermine
than to support the various reasons that people develop Linux.

	At the risk of being off topic, especially by your standards,
you are proving my point.  In the real world, censorship takes hold
for reasons that are "not about censorship", for reasons as noble as
you think yours are, by people as nice and well intentioned as you
might be.  It is also usually incremental (e.g., you can advocate a
change in the politburo's policies in theoretical academic journals
about public policy, but broadcasting such things on the news is
disruptive to the country and not within the purpose of a proper news
program).  When people implement censorship, they often claim that
what they're doing isn't censorship, that it's the last thing they can
do about people ignoring the forum's spirit again and again, etc.
