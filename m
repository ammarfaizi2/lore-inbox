Dear Friend,

Let me start by introducing myself, I am Mr. Maxwell Ibom an audit officer
in union bank plc. I have a concealed business suggestion for you. Though
we do not know each other but I came to you through the internet and was
inspired to seek your total co-operation.

My main point of contacting you is for to stand as the next of kin to
MR JEROLD FREEMAN who died together with her wife (Barbara) and kids in
plane crash in 1999. You can take a look at the homepage bellow:
http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm

During his life time, he made a numbered fixed deposit account for a 12
calendar months with the value of $30 MILLION USD in our branch, right
now the money is floating with principal and interest in our branch and
since his death no one has come across to claim this money.

The law of country is that any money that is more than 5 years in a fixed
deposit account will reverts to government treasury acccount.

What to be done?

I want you to please provide me your full name, full contact address and
private tel/fax number so that i can write an application letter for claim
to enable this money transferred to your account. Remember to keep this
business within yourself. It is only me and you that know this business
apart from God.

The money is to be shared at ratio of 55% for me, 40% to you and 5% for
any expenses both parties would be incurred during the process.

Please if you are interested, do not hesitate to get back to me or you
write through my alternative email; mrmaxwell_ibom17@zipmail.com.br
for further details.

Thanks,
Sincerely yours,
Mr. Maxwell Ibom
