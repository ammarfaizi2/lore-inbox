Under Unix/Linux, we use some sort of end-of-line indicator embedded
into text so all the characters don't pile up on the right-hand side
of the screen. Of course, Windows doesn't bother, which  is why
you need the 14 Gb just to hold all the white-space in a text file.

Also, there is no such thing as a "folder" in any Operating System.
Folder-like icons are display artifacts. Perhaps you mean "directory"?
