Let's try that again:

Short version: let's violate a license.
Long version: let's violate a license and see if we get in trouble.

Roman, we can do this forever.  Every time you cause a fuss more people
become aware of how unreasonable you are being.  That's fine with me,
come on back and flame some more.  

Our position is clear: we are trying to do the right thing for Linux,
we've developed a business model which works, we're committed to helping
Linux.  Yup, you're right, we aren't helping *you* in a way you like.
On the other hand, we are helping you, we've been doing it for years,
and we've been doing it in spite of you being a complete jerk about it.
And we'll keep doing it no matter how much of a jerk you want to
be because, surprise!, it isn't really about you.  It's about Linux.
And in so far as Linux is concerned, you are even less relevant than we
are and we aren't that big of a deal.  So Linux wins, you get to complain,
life goes on.

You know, you could change all this.  Instead of complaining that we
are somehow hurting you, which virtually 100% of the readers know is
nonsense, you could be producing an alternative answer which is better.
Instead of doing that you keep whining that we aren't helping you do that
and that isn't fair.  Hey, come on, get a grip.  I'm not out hear whining
that the GPL isn't fair to my agenda even though it frequently isn't.
I work around it if it is important.  If not using BK is important to you
then don't use it.  If having a free software SCM system is important to
you then create one.  But whining that we aren't helping you is beyond
pathetic and I am 100% positive I'm not alone in that opinion.
