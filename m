Subject: Current doc for writing device drivers?

Hello.

My device driver reference "Linux Device Drivers" (Rubini, published by O'Reilly
on Feb. '98) is getting pretty long in the tooth.  The book's primary focus is
on Linux v2.0.x, with some v2.2.x material tacked on to the end.

What reference(s) are recommended for current (v2.2/v2.4) Linux kernels?

Thank you.
