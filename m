Ok.  So the vendor gets out their technology that says "this drive
has been exposed to excessive G force."  So they have proof that it
has been dropped by someone.  However, the vendor can't prove that:

1. the vendor didn't drop it
2. the parcel company didn't drop it
3. you didn't drop it

Conversely, you can't prove:

1. that the vendor dropped it
2. the parcel company dropped it
3. you dropped it (not that you'd want to)

So its now their word against yours, and as you say, its up to the
vendor to prove that _you_ caused the damage.  Fortunately, this
technology doesn't do that, so honest users might be safe for the
time being.
