Andrea,

I can do.  I see this is a VM is of keen interest.  Question for you.
 To really compare apples to apples I could spider a web site or two
just find.  Then the challenge is to replay the "test" on the gui,
say KDE for example.  Do you know of any good tools that would alow
me to do a GUI record/playback?  I can then do an A vs B comparison.

Also, remind me, can I find your kernel to test on the SuSE FTP site
or via kernel.org.  I had tried a few of the SuSE 2.4 kernels a few
levels back and I recall I was going to the people directory of the
FTP site and getting them from mantel I seem to recollect.

I will search about on internet to see if I can find a
record/playback too to get some sort of good A vs B comparison.
