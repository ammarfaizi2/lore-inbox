One problem with the idea of banning "MS virus express" is that most of the
lemmings stuck with MS's windows are also stuck with the MS's mail app.  If they
had the wherewithall (personal, political, whatever) to switch to a different
mail app, they'de probably know how & be able to switch the whole thing to a
better environment.
