as also is yours; all athlons and durons, including the slot versions of
these processors, are SMP compatible. however, amd only officially
supports running smp combinations with the athlon mp chips.

IIRC, all AMD chips (P6x86 and up) are SMP compatible, however the older
chips (P6x86) are OpenAPIC standard versus the current APIC standard (i
forget the name).

hope this helps
