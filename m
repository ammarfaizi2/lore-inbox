    Do you mean we have less than 33 years to switch to a longer type
to store timestamps? I'm *seriously* frightened. I'm only 32, so I
think I will manage to spend another half of my life switching to 64
bits timestamps.

    But we shouldn't worry, anyway, because the end of the world is
scheduled to be much sooner. I've heard rumours about a hyperspace
speedway that must pass *just* over this tiny little planet we call
home. Maybe the answer is 42.
