Wasn't ReiserFS V4 promised months ago ? Are you that sure when it ships, it's 
going to be merge into mainline or let alone the -mm tree ? 

As a ReiserFS user, I'm fully behind theese new changes. I'd rather stay with 
the current fs I have ( with new features slowly trinkling in ) , then switch 
to a new untested fs ( ReiserFS V4 ).
