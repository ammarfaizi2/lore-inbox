Hi everybody.

Please CC me only any reply to this message, as I am
not a mailing list subscriber.

This was my last resort, as all searches on the
subject topic yield messages from 2004, many of which
mention Jeff Garzik's name.

After trying 2.6.13.2, I still don't get the PATA
drives recognized, so I believe it's still not there
yet.

The question is, will it ever be, or has it been
dropped?

Thank you very much.

Best regards.
