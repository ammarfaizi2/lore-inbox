If you keep a copy locally, sure.  But the upstream sources, i.e. what's 
important, you lose rights to even though you may have contributed 
substantial amounts of code.  IOW if binutils goes off in a direction 
you don't like, for example the FSF changes the license from GPL to 
Microsoft EULA, you don't have any say in the matter whatsoever.  You're 
left with a code fork based on the last GPL sources and/or the patches 
you've kept locally.

With Linux, I have a say in what happens to the upstream sources -- the 
thing most people care about :)
