Hi, all, I want to boot linux kernel directly from
mainboard rom
or flash, but the rom on mainboard is small and it
contains BIOS in it. 
Therefore I want to boot kernel from parallel port. I
can put linux
kernel on parallel storage. Is it possible to boot
linux kernel from
parallel port? If so, how to modify the kernel? If
someone knows,
please help me.
 
Barry
