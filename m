I've read this thread and I'm confused.  Is this seen as a problem with 
Evolution, ORBit, or the 2.5 kernel?  If it is seen as a possible kernel 
problem, I'll add it to my problem report status page and track it.  If I 
track it, Eric Blade will get a weekly email asking whether he's still 
seeing the problem, at least until I'm told to drop it, or no one 
responds.
