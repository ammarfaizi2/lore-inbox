By that logic, we should also include the lkml FAQ in the kernel tree.  Should
we?

I am worried that a creeping takeover of the Linux hitherto-successful
development process is in progress, that concensus on this topic has not been
achieved, and that there is a split coming.  That would not be good.

As always, what I do is in the interest of Linux and freedom.  That interest
is not served by driving a wedge firmly between two groups of Linux developers.
I hope you understand that I am a *moderate* with respect to this issue.
