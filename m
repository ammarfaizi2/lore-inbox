Of course.
But it is much better for the patent-interested parties if it wouldn't
be necessary (and said parties are actually complaining about the "must
publish" thing).
And the times are long gone when a patent was actually "publishing".
They use since ages there own secret language so
- the patent system as such doen not enforce "publisching" (except you
  are one of speakers of "patent quak").
- that even the most trivial idea looks like it is very complicated.
- that even an already implemented idean looks like it is very new.
