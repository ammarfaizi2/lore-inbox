Wow, you didn't get along with the other kids did you? So far i see 
absolutely no reason why anybody should lend you a hand (no one gets paid 
for support here), perhaps instead of just blurting out insults at the 
kind folks trying to help you out, you may have tried putting forward 
additional questions as to why they consider the proposed methods evil, 
and wether there are more sane ways of achieving the same result.

Perhaps next time consider using another muscle apart from the one in your 
sphincter to convey your message...
