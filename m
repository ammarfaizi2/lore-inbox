Hi,=20

I am looking for some info (ie a patch, link, etc) on an interface which
would allow for registration of named transforms.  Had a chance to
briefly talk to Alan about this; he mentioned that something of this
nature already existed for 2.5.  But I was unable to find any
references...

I have started such a project a while back and wanted to pick it up.
Naturally, I would prefer to extend the current efforts not duplicate
existing ones.

My stuff, as old and dusty as it may be, is located here...

Cheers,
Bart.
