Hi,

see, in fact it is not huge commercial solution what i need - i'm 
interested in squeezing every single electron from machines i have in 
school, and i thought that for some applications cluster is the best 
method of sharing computing power. i'm not thinking (yet) about 
optimizing it to some particular function. i simply wanted to know how 
clustrer works and how it makes use of multiple machines. but, the 
system has to satisfy one limitation - it must be completly usuable in 
floppy-booting mode (machines i can use are normally used under control 
of Micro$oft (r) Win*** (tm) eXPloit Sewer and i cannot reinstall their 
systems without being sucked from school, so i can incorporate them into 
cluster only by booting system from another medium, prefferably from 
floppy). as far i've tested openMosix, and it works quite good. maybe in 
future i will be given a real server-farm, where i could set up 
everything sane. but now i need only links to some solutions, so i can 
test them.
thanks for your help
