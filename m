Well, I heard that the xscale are slower than the old SA.

My recommendation is a SL 5500 ;-) . The Sucessor of it has also an Xscale processor, so I think that there will be only little [docs from manufacturers ;-)] problems to run Linux on every Xscale PDA.

But stay away from Xscale, it is like the P4: optimized for MHz, not for instructions per clock.
