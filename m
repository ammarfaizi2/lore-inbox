I've been very happy with BK, been using it shortly after Linus started
doing so. Mostly out of curiosity at first, later because it was
actually quite useful. I even see myself as a fairly pragmatic
individual, but even so I do find it increasingly difficult to defend my
BK usage.

So please stop thinking you can judge that easily by pushing me into
your nice little 'some people will never be happy bla bla' category.
