Ah, yes, the RT/PC.  That brings back some fond memories.  My first exposure to
Unix was with AIX on the RT.  I still have some of those weird-sized RT AIX
manuals around somewhere...

You are partially correct.  AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) was built
by the Boston office of Interactive Systems under contract to IBM.  We had
a maximum of 17 people in the effort which shipped on the RT in January
1986.

Prior to that time, Interactive Systems had produced a port of System III
running on the PC/XT called PC/IX which was sold via IBM.  I used PC/IX to
produce the software only floating point code in the first version of AIX.
