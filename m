Subject: [OT] RH 2.4.7 kernel panic:  How to get a new kernel on there?

I just upgraded my VAIO PCG-fx210 to RH 7.2 (from RH 7.1 + custom kernel).
I also upgraded to GRUB.

Now, the kernel panics every time when I try too boot.  Does anyone
know how to tell grub to boot one of my old kernel images in
  /  ?  I also can't remember the exact name of that old kernel,
so can I get grub to do an 'ls' in root?

Any other ideas are welcome!  If you want the kernel panics,
I can hand-copy them...but it seems to be a known problem according
to RH's bugzilla.

Thanks,
Ben
