The thing is that Linus' tree is the "main" tree, and It should remain that 
way so that linux is "one". Linus' _HAS_ the right to do anything he wants 
with his tree, and all the distributors will take _his_ tree and the thing we 
all dread might happen ("you have to have version 12 of red hat linux 
_signed_ kernel to run this thing"). You _ARE_ allowed to have your _OWN_ 
tree without the stuff that you think is not right, but that won't help the 
situation (because that thing you want to run demands a signed kernel)
I think we have a problem here...
