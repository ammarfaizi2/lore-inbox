Well, there are people working on it.  I seem to be one of the few people 
for whom a 2.5.x + nvidia kernel really scratches an itch.  (for me, it's 
my laptop + kernel IPSEC)

There are patches at www.minion.de that make things stable up to 2.5.53. 
.54 broke it again, but that will be fixed shortly.
