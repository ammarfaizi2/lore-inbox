Hi:

I have a PriMed P2MMX machine that works fine with 2.2.x (I installed
RH7.0 on it, and then updated to 2.2.18.  I'm trying to get 2.4.2 to
work, but it seems to hang in the IDE/disk initialization when it
boots.  I'll enclose the .config from 2.2.18 and from 2.4.2.  

When 2.2.18 boots, the lines that appear on the console while the IDE
drivers come up are:

SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: Maxtor 90640D4, ATA DISK drive
hdc: CD-ROM CDU55E, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: Maxtor 90640D4, 6149MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=784/255/63
hdc: ATAPI 2X CD-ROM drive, 256kB Cache

With 2.4.2, it's a bit different:

block:  queued sectors max/low 30045kB/10015kB, 128 slots per queue
Uniform MultiPlatform E-IDE driver Revision 6.31
ide: assuminmg 33 MHz system bus speed for PIO modes: override with
idebus=xx
SIS5513: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 09
PCI: Assigned IRQ 14 for device 00:01.1
SIS5513: chipset revision 208
SIS5513: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
SIS5597
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hda: Maxtor 90640D4, ATA DISK drive
hdc: CD-ROM CDU55E, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15

At this point, the machine hangs...

Here's /proc/pci

Also, while we're at it, I downloaded Alan's latest patches, and the
