I tend to collect such things, but lost early stuff in disk crashes.
There is here

- stuff from ftp://ftp.uwsg.iu.edu/linux/mail.archive/kernel/
  1 Mar 1996 - now.

[you can ftp that yourself, I suppose]

- stuff from linuxwww.db.erau.edu
  96.06-99.09.

- linux-activists list archive
  Very fragmentary, Oct 1991 to Oct 1993.
  Also Oct 1993 to Jul 1995.
  Also Jan 1992 to Dec 1993.

- linux-kernel
  Jul 1995 to Apr 1996.

[lots of garbage in various different formats and from various sources;
very time consuming to sort out; different archives are very similar
but do not have precisely the same posts; I can make the raw stuff
available if you want - maybe you don't want]

In case you reply - do so to aeb@cwi.nl

[Btw - if others have old archives, I'd be happy to get a copy.
Both mailing lists and old (pre 0.99) sources and binaries.
Still searching libc sources earlier than libc 4.3.]
