	You know, I read over my original argument again, and I absolutely cannot
understand how you could have misunderstood it. There is no reference to
property law at all in it, and several times I mentioned that I was talking
about contract law. So how you could have misunderstood me to mean that
property law applies to contracts is baffling to me. What I mean is the
reverse, that intangible property rights and conceptually part of contract
law.

	The one thing I said that was not clear and where I understand your
confusion was:

> Most property rights are contractual. You come to own property because you
contract for it.

	However, I maintain that the rest of my argument is completely clear and
you have not responded to it:

States.

>Because there was no need for them to do so. If I have possession of an

anyone else, I don't

that affect.
