And what does that make writing your own operating system ? Some of the
security folks are publicity seekers, others see it as an investment
against getting a job by becoming known. Quite a few we deal with a
large professional organisations who don't need publicity and actually
the more interesting bodies often don't *want* publicity just to ensure
that all their vendors have fixes before things go public and that their
government infrastructure and nation state will be best served.

They don't agree with you, nor do the economists I'm afraid.

Its ok I'm sure they think you are an arrogant clueless jerk 8)

The "vendor-sec" mentality - from someone who has never been involved in
it. Ah yes Linus you might want to consider writing articles for a local
newspaper you appear to have the right qualifications for it 8)

vendor-sec has a lot of people on it who don't like long non-disclosure
periods and get quite annoyed when they happen out of our control (eg
CERT originated notifications).
