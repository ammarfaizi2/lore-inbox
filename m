I was wondering, is there some method or utility that will allow me to
compress my kernel (vmlinux)? I was running an alpha and bzImage and zImage
don’t work.  I read all the mans that I could lay my grubby little hands on
but none of them mentioned HOW one is the compress a vmlinux kernel.  
 
The reason ask this is, I boot to linux using an OLD IDE drive and it takes
sometime to read a 7mb file. I noticed that the original kernel
(Redhat/Compaq derivative) was compressed and somewhat smaller, about less
than half the size. Thanks, Will L G
