Because they made a driver (or at least aided in the development by 
supplying some information) that works. Which is more than can be said of 
other webcam producing companies. Also note that a big part of their 
driver actually is opensource.

That's true, but at least with this Philips driver I was only half screwed 
for using Linux. It worked. And I refuse to tell people around me that I 
can't install a webcam because Linux doesn't support it. And I'll be 
damned if I install windows just to get a little webcam working.

I at least understand your reasoning, since I am familiar with and respect 
opensource principles, but no sane non-opensource person will say: "Oh, 
I'd really like to have a webcam, but hey, I run Linux..." I might be 
fanatical enough to deny myself any non-opensource friendly hardware, but 
this reasoning does not fly with other people around me. I might swallow 
and send an angry letter to the company, but my girlfriend would install 
Windows and get on with her life. Which is why it's so damn important that 
Linux supports at least some of these devices people can actually buy.
