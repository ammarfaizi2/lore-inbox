Hey, Pavel, do me a favor and take me off the cc list.  I've unsubscribed
from the Linux kernel list, this is a good example of why.  No sense of
humor on your part, and you are whining about a license on a 200 line
chunk of code.  Any decent programmer could have reimplemented it in
less time than it took you to complain.
