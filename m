Hi,

To all: I'm not interested in personal attacks. If I want them, I'll tell
you.

You won't see further works from me. I'll also stop communicating to the
maintainers. My work doesn't seem of interest to you. I really don't think
we'll get anywhere with this attitude. If it's about names, be glad to
have an accepted name. I like mine.

Have fun.

			Thunder
