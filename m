Dear David,

The program is an atmospheric chemistry-transport modeling code that computes 
the distributions of atmospheric species (e.g., ozone) as a function of 
latitude and altitude and how that changes with time.

Thanks for taking time to think about my problem. I greatly appreciate it.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Regards.

Sheo
