This has been changed in the cryptodev-2.6 tree:

http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/herbert/cryptodev-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=310d6a0c14eda153869adaf74e69dbd1a1256e7f

[CRYPTO] cipher: Removed special IV checks for ECB

This patch makes IV operations on ECB fail through nocrypt_iv rather than
calling BUG().  This is needed to generalise CBC/ECB using the template
mechanism.

In fact with the new block cipher type calling the IV-specific
functions on ECB will work in the same way as the IV-less functions.
This makes sense because the IV length is simply zero.

If the user is ignoring the error value here then you're in serious
trouble anyway since they've just lost all their data.
