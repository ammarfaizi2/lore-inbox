Well I don't remember the discussion thread on alsa-devel about this,
but it's a good idea that alsa-lib checks the capability of hw-mixing
and apples dmix only if necessary.  (In the case of softvol, it can
check the existence of hw control by itself, though.)

Currently, dmix is enabled per driver-type base.  That is, dmix is set
to default in each driver's configuration which is known to have no hw
mixing functionality.

On 1.0.9, dmix will be default, too, for most of mobo drivers.
