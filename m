This is probably a user-land and/or undocumented thing, but I am not
certain where to get the correct info.

Does anyone know how to get the screen brightness control to work on a
Sony Vaio N505VE?  There seems to be some sort of proprietary hook to get
it to work that requires their install of Windows.  (This is a problem as
it was removed immediatly after purchacing the laptop.)

I figured someone here might know, since at least one person on this list
has a Vaio.  (Unless Linus sold it to buy more beer. ]:> )

Pointers to a non-Windows solution would be appreciated, as it is hell on
my battery life.

BTW, the Yamaha sound chip in the Vaio is supported under Alsa.  You might
ask them what they did to get it to work, so it can be included in the
stock kernel. (Or maybe it already has and I have just not been looking.)

And as for code comments, they should be written in Ancient Greek with
code examples taken from APL and BCPL and written using the ISO character
set for Sanscrit.  (To avoid complaints of swear words appearing in them
by the morally clenched.)
