The copy into RAM has its own exemption in 17 USC 117(a)(1):

Sec. 117. - Limitations on exclusive rights: Computer programs

(a) Making of Additional Copy or Adaptation by Owner of Copy. -
Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106, it is not an infringement for
the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making of
another copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:

(1) that such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step in the
utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it
is used in no other manner, or

You're intentionally being obtuse.  NOTHING IN THE GPL CONTROLS WHAT YOU DO
WITH IT ON YOUR MACHINE.  You're *totally* free to write the most
non-GPL-compliant code and run it.  What you're NOT allowed to do is then
DISTRIBUTE the resulting code to others.
