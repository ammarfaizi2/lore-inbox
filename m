I've installed the 2.4.18 source and looked for references to chipsets, but I 
am mostly lost.

I'd never consider myself a competent coder, but I'm stuborn about fixing 
things.  Where do I find source for this and other chipsets?  

Also, I understand via is supposed to be forthcoming in an open source sort of 
way regarding specification (as opposed to nvidia).  Any clue will help.

David Weeks

ps -- has anyone ever tried to htdig the source files?  Wouldn't that help, 
such as a concordance would?  I spend all my time looking for stuff, don't 
find what I'm looking for, and don't get anything done.

Dave
