I had (on a 2G disk) a NTFS, a FAT and some Linux partitions. It even
refused
to convert to dynamic disk. When it finally did, my Linux partitions
vanished.
You need this support to even be able to use linux on that disk... btw
that
is my largest HDD I have :(
So I now removed that crap, bought a laptop and use static disks. And
installed
some linux.
