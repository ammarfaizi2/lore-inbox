I've just compiled 2.5.60-mm1 (plus Ed Tomlinson's O(1) threading patch, but I 
can get the same oops without), and I'm getting a BUG being triggered in 
mm/slab.c in kmem_cache_create,  in bootup, just before init gets called. 
Before this, I'm getting a large number of "bad: scheduling while atomic".

Not sure whether this is coming from -mm1 or not as I haven't (yet) tried a 
compile of vanilla 2.5.60. If it could be helpful, ask and I will.

The stack dump from the last of the "scheduling while atomic" messages:
