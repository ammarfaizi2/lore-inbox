"In early 1985, the /usr/group committee was merged with the newly formed
IEEE POSIX Working Group (POSIX stands for Portable Operating Systems
for Computing Environments) and the /usr/group standard was adopted as a
first draft."

UN*Xen were around for 15 years before anybody was brave (or stupid :)
enough to really standardize. The first drafts of these standards are only
16-18 years old.
