I never felt it was a personal issue.  It's a technical problem, and 
it's a legal problem.

No one faults Marc for what he wanted to do.  We only fault him for the 
way he went about doing it.

I'm ambivalent about the future impact of supporting companies who do 
not want to develop open-source drivers, but I DO support Marc's right 
to develop software which aids in using proprietary drivers under Linux 
for the sake of users who otherwise could not use their hardware.  That 
is to say, there are certain philosophical aspects of developing such a 
wrapper that concern me, but I respect Marc's right to do it anyway.

We respect this explanation, but this explanation has nothing to do with 
what we're complaining about, which is why this discussion continues.

It's like being asked why you stubbed your classmate's toe and 
responding "because it's Thursday".  Well, not THAT far off, but it 
demonstrates my point.

We DO accept the fact that he didn't MEAN to break the law.  It's just 
not a valid excuse!

And that's what's happening.  It's Marc's insistence that he's innocent 
on the grounds that he didn't mean it that has so many people all riled 
up about it.

Yes, we're "letting him off" (ie. not suing for past infractions) on the 
grounds that he didn't mean it, but we want him to understand why he 
shouldn't have done it and stop doing it.  He doesn't seem to understand 
why it was wrong, and that bugs us.

If Marc had just said, "OOPS!  Sorry.  That was a stupid error on my 
part.  I'll fix it and never do it again," then this argument would 
never have happened.

Mistakes happen all the time.  We're just used to people who are able to 
learn from their mistakes.
