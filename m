DKDY Reports Increase of 8.5% on Number of Tourists During the Golden Week 
Holiday, Indicating an Improved Tourism Year

XI'AN, China, March 7 /Xinhua-PRNewswire/ Dark Dynamite Inc. (OTC Bulletin 
Board: DKDY)(''DKDY'') announced today that the E-Pang Palace Theme Park 
(the ''Theme Park'') has greatly benefited from the booming Xi'an Spring 
Festival tourism market, receiving almost 10,000 tourists during the Spring 
Festival period, an increase of 8.5% over the same period of 2005. The 
prosperous Spring Festival tourism market also indicates an improved trend 
of the Xi'an tourism market in 2006.

According to the latest statistics from the Xi'an Holiday Office, Xi'an 
received 1.2 million tourists during the Golden Tourism Week of the Spring 
Festival vacation from January 29 to February 4, and created a total revenue 
of RMB 585 million (equal to US$72.2 million), an increase of 8.9% compared 
with that of the previous year. The historical scenic spots in Xi'an were 
highly welcomed during the golden week. For instance, Emperor Qin's 
Terracotta Museum and DaCiEn Temple received 33,435 and 18,163 tourists, an 
increase of 3.41% and 5.5% respectively over the same period of 2005.

The booming Spring Festival tourism market indicates an encouraging trend 
for the Xi'an tourism market in 2006. DKDY scheduled the Qin Dynasty 
Cultural Dinner Show program in September 2006, right before the Chinese 
National Day holiday, the third golden tourism week in China. With reference 
to the booming tourism market during the Golden Tourism Week of the Spring 
Festival, the management of DKDY believes the Dinner Show will attract many
