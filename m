X-Mailer: VM 7.07 under Emacs 20.6.1

Hi,

I've got a dual PIII x450mhz P6DGB system with 128mb of RAM.  It locks
up when booting 2.5.41-ac1 when Preemption is enabled.  Here's what's
on the console (copied yb hand) when it locks up:

    calibrating APIC timer ...
    ..... CPU clock speed is 450.0979 Mhz.
    ..... host bus clock speed is 100.0217 Mhz.
    checking TSC synchronization across 2 CPUs: passed.
    Starting migration thread for cpu 0
    Bringing up 1
    CPU 1 IS NOW UP!
    Starting migration thread for cp 1


It's a hard lockup and I need to hit the reset key to make it reboot.
Here's my .config at the end of the message.

I can do other testing, maybe I'll get to put -ac2 on tonight and test
that out too.
