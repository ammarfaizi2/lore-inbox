Hello,

since the patch 2.4.20-pre6, the compilation of the kernel fail with
this messages :

make -C irda modules
make[3]: Entering directory

make: *** [_mod_drivers] Error 2

The reference TIOCM_... missing to the module ...

I join my configuration file. The compiler is gcc-2.95.4 and I have a
debian sid up to date.

Simply a macro to add in includes files but I've not the overview of
this drivers to do a patch.

Sincerely

Didier LINK
