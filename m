Dunno about that, but I have heard of "clever techniques" using XOR in
graphic sprite manipulation being used in microcomputer games in the
early/mid 80's.  No mention of NuGraphics' patent was present - in fact
this code was available in an "Assembly for fun" type book which I still
have a copy of.

The computer on which these techniques was demonstrated was the BBC
Microcomputer, released in 1981 and based on a 2 MHz 6502.  Similar
techniques were doubtless used on games for the Apple ][ which was released
several years previously using a 1 MHz 6502.
