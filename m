I nominate a committee of three composed of:

1.  My wife - who knows how to run the world better than anyone else, and 
will tell you so.

2.  My daughter - who knows teenage boys (the next generation of hackers) 
better than anyone else and will tell you so.

3.  My son - who is God's gift to computing, and will tell you so.
