It looks like GPL enforcement is the pretext for the changes.  Ah well, it's
not my concern, he can make BitKeeper as intrusive as he likes, fortunately
I am not going to be annoyed by that because I'm just taking a pass on the
whole thing.  Thanks to the recent discussion, which opened my eyes.

I'm glad it's helping Linus to scale, much as Microsoft Office helps office
workers to scale.  That's good I suppose.  I keep telling myself.

Wait.  I thought people were perfectly able to do whatever they wanted with
BitKeeper, so long as they use the open logging.  I guess I was wrong about
that.  This is getting more anal all the time.

It's impossible not to read that as 'add more restrictions'.

Indeed.  Just one more reason to build a replacement I suppose.
