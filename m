TCP/IP is assured, in the case of my @Home service, they provide me with the
transport layer and settings (IP, subnet, etc) but no software support.
That is a provider choice, and I have no problem with it.  Microsoft does
not (and will never) control the transport layer.  Doing so will kill Cisco
routers, etc.  Being an ISP myself, there is absolutely nothing Microsoft
can say or do to force me to support only them.  If XP clients don't work
with my service, give someone a little while and there will be a plug-in or
patch that allows XP to run with standard service.  As I said, they can do
nothing for force me to move over to only Microsoft support.  I am Linux,
and I'm only a small-guy.
