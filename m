OK; In which case, it might help to provide some explanation as to why
you think that Ron Guilmette is "committing an act of criminal fraud,
computer misuse and a few other violations".

The existence of Michael Warfield's message suggests that I wasn't the

anyone whose knowledge of this issue is limited to what has appeared
in this thread, all we have to go in is Ron's email, as posted by
Keith Owens.
