Looking at apm.c, there's not enough difference to account for this
regression so I started looking more broadly.  I found that in the -ac
tree there's a bunch of power management code that's been added to
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c (by Mikael Petterson).

Disabling APIC solves my immediate problem, so personally I'm happy.

Obviously, that not The Right Thing (tm) so Mikael, if you want a
debugging guinea pig, feel free to contact me.

My new config is attached.
