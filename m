Then why don't you stop threatening to take it away every time someone 
points out to you that your "help" for free software isn't ideal?   Just 
can't help yourself?  Your cheap shot at Alexandre doesn't change the fact 
that you've shown yet again why people who believe in free software should 
work to replace BK.
