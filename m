Hi,

My workstation froze hard again , this time after few hours.

There was no disk activiy and nothing on the serial console :-(

The machine didn't freeze even even when i ran several program et the same time
(opera, mozilla, sylpheed, pan,etc...) but froze as the box was almost idle.

Thanks,

Philippe
