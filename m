Izzat what triggers it?   Maybe we should all spend our nights coon 
hunting.  Thats an old boys game that can be lucrative at times.  I 
know one kid back in Nebraska that stuck them in the freezer till the 
price got good, and when he cleaned out the freezer, bought himself  
new Dodge Hemihead Charger for a high school graduation present.
