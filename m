I went after 2.6.10-rc1, and the bk6 patch for it, and its been 
running here for about 2 hours, no hits, no runs, no errors so far.
I watched a little tvtime, browsed with FF for an hour or so, and of 
course kmail runs full time here.  And amanda just finished up.  It 
feels good, and Just Works(tm).
