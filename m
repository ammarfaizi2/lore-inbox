OK, so there are no significant numbers of patches that the patchbot will
eliminate, by your admission.  So what's the point?  What is the problem
you have solved?  And where's the code?  This sounds like you have whittled
it down to a cgi-script of about 100 lines of perl.  How about building it
and demonstrating the usefulness rather than telling us how great it is 
going to be?
