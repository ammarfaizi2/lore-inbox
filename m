<crap>
Its me!
I'm the second person in our solar system that has such a card! 
I do have the New Media *Basics SCSI* card! I remember back in the kernel 2.2 
days that I had found that code, hacked it and used it.. Since then, I hadn't 
tried to use it again. Actually, I lost (hd failure) the system together with 
the patch I had for that code..
Anyway, I believe that support for such hw is another Linux success story and 
reserves a sticker at major distros saying "Linux: Supports all hardware; 
even New Media's SCSI cards!".
</crap>

I cleanly compiled and run your module. Looks OK. I haven't yet attached any 
peripheral, though. It's of no use to me, but I will be glad to help you by 
testing that code (w. devices as well).
Thanks for resurrecting the dead!
