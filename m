	Hi Marcelo,

	One of the IrDA patch I sent you didn't made it into the
kernel. That's unfortunate because it was one half of a complete
patch, and as the other part is in the kernel, the IrDA stack is not
functional (see previous e-mail).
	I've rediffed the patch against 2.4.21-pre2 to avoid the fuzz,
and it is included below. Would you mind including that in the kernel ?

	Regards,

	Jean


ir241_flow_sched_lap_lmp-7.diff :
-------------------------------
        o [FEATURE] Reduce LAP Tx queue to 2 packets (from 10)
                Improve latency, reduce buffer usage
        o [FEATURE] LAP Tx queue not full notification (flow start)
                Poll higher layer to fill synchronously LAP window (7 packets)
        o [FEATURE] LMP LSAP scheduler
                Ensure Tx fairness between LSAPs (sockets, IrCOMM, IrNET...)

		<And I might add...>
        o [CRITICA] Required by the IrTTP patch already in 2.4.21-pre2
