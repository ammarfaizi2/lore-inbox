Suppose that A and B share current->files and fd has a POSIX lock on it.

A			B
unshare_files
steal_locks
			close(fd)
exec fails
steal_locks
put_files_struct

The close in B fails to release the lock as it has been stolen by the
new files structure.  The second steal_locks sets the fl_owner back to
the original files structure which no longer has fd in it and hence can
never release that lock.  The put_files_struct doesn't release the lock
either since it is now owned by the original file structure.
