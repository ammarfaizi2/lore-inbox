I think the comments added say it pretty well, but I'll repeat it here.

This fix is pretty similar in concept to the one that Arnd posted
as a temporary workaround, but I've added a few comments explaining
what the actual assumptions are, and improved it a wee little bit.

The end goal here is to simply avoid calling the early_*() functions
when it is _not_ early.  Those functions stop working as soon as
free_initmem() is called.  system_state is set to SYSTEM_RUNNING
just after free_initmem() is called, so it seems appropriate to use
here.

I did think twice about actually using SYSTEM_RUNNING because we
moved away from it in other parts of memory hotplug, but those
were actually for _allocations_ in favor of slab_is_available(),
and we really don't care about the slab here.

The only other assumption is that all memory-hotplug-time pages 
given to memmap_init_zone() are valid and able to be onlined into
any any zone after the system is running.  The "valid" part is
really just a question of whether or not a 'struct page' is there
for the pfn, and *not* whether there is actual memory.  Since
all sparsemem sections have contiguous mem_map[]s within them,
and we only memory hotplug entire sparsemem sections, we can
be confident that this assumption will hold.

As for the memory being in the right node, we'll assume tha
memory hotplug is putting things in the right node.
