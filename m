	Oh!  That's funny!

	Back in "the bad old days" Novell got laughed right off several
campuses for this very reason.  Why?  Because Netware, at the time, could
not handle more than 256 users on a given server.  One admin I knew
here at Georgia Tech reported on the expression on the face of the Novell
presales support person when he was informed that the average public
server had several thousand accounts.

	Netware customers that are worried about more than a few hundred
users must be fairly recent (4.x and about - 3.x has come into discussion
but doesn't count here) customers.  Obviously, they are big and SIGNIFICANT
customers.  Do we know that Linux can't handle the load, though, or is
this just more supposition based on statistics?
