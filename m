Sure, and I had a large hand in that.  But I'll tell you this, I'm *tired*
of uphill battles.  It's a major use or waste of my time, even when
successful, and I do not like making a pest of myself.  I'm sure this
particular battle is going to be successful, but I'm not going to fight
it.  I've said my piece and I have other things to do.
