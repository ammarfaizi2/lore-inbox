Is there any reason for not putting the kernel(and it's updates) up on a
tracker on kernel.org?  I looked through the list and noted that there
has not been any discussion in regards to this topic.

I personally don't have enough up-stream bandwidth(384K) to support a
tracker, but I have enough to contribute to a torrent...
