I am not paying $2500-$5000 annual for membership sorry.
It is bad enough that I burn $800 for T13 plus about $1000 per meeting.
$7000 is my personal financial limit.

If you want to give me the SPEC to review and no NDA cool, but CFA and SDA
I have not interest in the legal action that will happen I expose SDA for
what it is ...
