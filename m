   This patch is against test10pre7 but applies cleanly to test10
   final as well.

This patch is fine, thanks a lot.

OH, btw, for all folks out there.  If there ever is an instance where
I (Alexey too) send email directly to your email address (not via
linux-kernel for example) your site will be effectively ECN tested.
We run ECN on all the time on our workstations.  (it's actually nice,
a lot of crap web sites I used to visit occaisionally are no longer
reachable :-) the only major loss is theregister.co.uk :-( )

So if it appears as if Alexey and myself are ignoring you, better
check whether your mail server can talk to off-site ECN speaking
hosts first.

Later,
