Goodday Friend,
 I'm SHADAK SHARI,an Indian citizen,but made fame in Iraq.I've been into
business for the past 10 years.I became a great man when i had a licence
to be an international crude oil maketer 6 years Ago.
 I've helped so many orphange homes,needy homes and the less priviledge
accross the African continents,with the wealth God gave to me.The last comflicts
that happened in Iraq made me to loose all i've worked for.I loosed entirely
all i've worked for.Now i can't hear again ,and my left leg has been amputated.
    The doctor said i've a little more time to stay in this planet.My good
friend,i want you to do me a favour.I kept some amount af money with a security
company in Europe and Asia Amounting to about $8.6M and $5.2M respectively
in a Methalic sealed box. I want you to take the place of my next of Kin,my
only surviving kid is just too young to handle this.She is just 5 years
old now.I'm doing this based on the short time i've on Earth.I'm an old
man.Please this should be confidencial between you and me. If this transaction
is sucessful,which i believe it will,20% is yours,10% will be for all the
expenses and 70% should be used in setting up an orphanage home that will
be named after my late wife's name, who bears the same name with my little
girl.This orphange home 'll be taken care off by you,till my daughter comes
of Age. My lawyer is already aware of this.Pls get back to me Urgently
for more instructions:
shadak_shari@india.com
Best Regards,
SHADAK SHARI.
