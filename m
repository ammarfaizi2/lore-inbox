Did I imply he was incapable?  Of course, making decisions requires
input, and I was simply offerring input.  Whether or not he reads my
input is entirely up to him.  My advice is free, and as such is given at
face value.

If he didn't care he wouldn't write back with such strong words as
[Nicklaus Wirth] "doesn't have a frigging clue."  

Obviously Mr. Torvalds cares about the topic enough to say something. 
He has no obligation to explain his position to me, though.  I'm a
nobody.
