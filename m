Thank you very much.. do you find incompatibilities here:

/******************  Software Mestizo Manifesto  *********************
 * This code is **Software Mestizo** meaning it has been developed with
 * the help of many diverse individuals worldwide; no matter their 
 * racial or cultural origin, they all work together in peace and harmony 
 * in the belief of humankind fraternity.  Using this software with the 
 * purpose of harming these principles is to harm the software itself,
 * We advice to use it only in the context of these principles or refrain 
 * from its use if you don't agree with the spirit in which it was 
 * written.
 */ 

Please let the people to decide wether they want to attach this to their
source code.. I am only trying to do a manifesto which I think is valuable

Please send a CC: to Guido Socher <guido@bearix.oche.de> he is the
Editor-in-Chief of www.linuxfocus.org maybe he could help (or kill me
still dont know.. anyway).


Regards

Roberto
