Dear Linux Kernel Hackers,

We are a team from The Boston Consulting Group (BCG)(http://www.bcg.com), an
international strategy and management consulting firm, researching the
fascinating phenomenon of Free/Open Source software development. We would
like to request your participation in an independent, confidential survey
about your experience with Linux development.

The survey is located here: http://www.bcglinuxsurvey.com
(It should not take more than 15 minutes to complete)

We are offering prizes for participation!!! To thank you for submitting
completed surveys, we will enter you in a lottery to win gift certificates
from ThinkGeek.com. We will be giving away 3 gift certificates valued at
$200, $100, and $50 (USD). Winners will be notified by e-mail. To enter
you in the drawing, we will need your response by December 11, 2001.

All responses will be confidential. No one outside of our research team
will have access to the responses.  We will make available all the aggregate
data we collect and all of our analysis and findings to this list and to the
public.

Also note that this research is intended to shape BCG's independent point of
view only - no other company has commissioned this study. 


Please contact us at opensource@bcg.com if you have any questions and
concerns.  

Best regards,

Karim Lakhani      Bob Wolf
