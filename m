hi

i'm fairly new to linux but i'm eager to learn.
i'm running suse 7.3 on a dell inspiron 8000.
i used to run suse 7.1 (2.2.??) and the apm worked "fine" as far as i could 
tell
now i cant suspend or un/plug the ac power while linux is running.
i've made several attemps by compiling new kernels. But nothing worked.
i've looked in the archive of this list and found several mails that handeld 
or discribed several problems i had but appearently didn't offer a straight 
up way the get rid of the problem.

plz
help
