I'm looking a purchasing a dozen computers with the Soyo SY-K7V Dragon 
Plus motherboard.  It has the KT266A chipset.

My question is Linux support for the onboard ethernet and sound.  I've 
googled all over and haven't come up with a definitive answer.

They are described as "VIA 10/100 Ethernet" and "CMI 8738 Audio chip".

Does anyone know the scoop?

Dax
