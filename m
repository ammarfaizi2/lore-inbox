Guys, Larry isn't saying that you are not allowed to BUY a copy of
bitkeeper and reeverse engineer it, he is saying that you are not allowed
to get the FREE copy of bitkeeper and reverse engineer it.

if you give Larry money for a license you can reverse engineer it,
analyse it's tools, etc under all the reasoning that you give about your
legal right to something you have paid for.

but the FREE use of bitkeeper does not give you the same rights. Larry is
saying that he won't give people who are perceived as 'out to get him' a
free license for bitkeeper

so drop all this nonsense about the rights you have for purchasing
software and how evil Larry is for trying to take those rights away.
