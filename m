You're missing my point.  I was not claiming that cdrecord's naming 
scheme was great and I'm still not claiming that.  I was objecting to
what I saw as a needless slam on someone who has produced a useful tool,
maintained it for years, and we've all used it for years.

Personally, I think a

    The cdrecord naming scheme is broken, we aren't going to support it.

would have been enough.  Maybe Linus has some issues with the author but
that's no excuse to be that rude.  I'm a little tired of this mailing
list hammering on people more than is needed.
