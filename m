Don't take my word for it. Here's an article written by Jerry Epplin in
February 2001:
http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT2094189920.html

He ends his article with the following:
"It seems to me, RTLinux is a fine system with great potential when thought
of as an open-source project. I'm not sure it will fare as well when looked
at as a commercial RTOS."

As for my own opinion, please reread my first post. It clearly says that
the current rtlinux patent situation (in its entirety) is a show-stopper
for Linux. Everything I said after that all boils down to explaining this
point of view.

Care to look at the VDC report conducted over 11,000 developers. Result:
the #1 fact inhibiting Linux's adoption in the embedded space is
"real-time limitations."

Don't listen to me, listen to 11,000 developers ...
