Some additions to the previous mail: I was able to isolate the problem to the 
introduction of a user specificable value of HZ (in include/asm-ppc/parm.h). 
I used a value of 250 while the former default was 1000. Setting it back to 
1000 makes the clock tick right again.

Is the CONFIG_HZ known to be broken on PPC ?

Thanks

Marc
