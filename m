The brain-damaged part wasn't the calibration. It was the calibration 
being done in the touchscreen itself, instead of letting the PC handle 
it for them. We will always need calibration, of course.

You're missing my point completely... :(

What I was suggesting was that we don't use physical calibration *at all*.

We let the touch screen send the widest range it can muster, so that we 
don't have quantization errors. We then calibrate in software as for any 
other touch screen, using the coordinates sent as "raw data".

If you don't try to configure the "physical calibration" of a Elo, 
MuTouch, etc, they send coordinates in a nice 0..2^N-1 format. That is 
the best approach IMHO.

Even if they can not be generated by a keyboard, if you don't handle 
them in special way, you'll get a lot of rubbish. We do handle the 
special sequences when available, but there still barcode scanners that 
don't generate a nice sequence.

There are even barcode scanners that generate things like <press 
Alt>+<numeric X>+<numeric Y>+<numeric Z>+<release Alt> without even 
bothering to release the numeric keys, to generate ASCII code XYZ :P
