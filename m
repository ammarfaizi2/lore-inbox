It is my understanding that the ad hominem fallacy takes the form "you are a
patronising little shit, therefore what you say cannot be true". 

Rusty's comment seemed to be only that you were a patronising little shit,
and not that this proved you to be incorrect -- hence it doesn't appear to 
be a particularly fine example of 'ad hominem' at all.
