I'm sorry if this question has been answered recently (I'm not
subscribed to the list).

I'm planning on getting a new workstation, and I kinda want an AMD
system. But it seems that most (all?) motherboards for the amd cpu's use
VIA chipsets, and some people have experienced problems with via
chipsets and linux.

Have these problems been fixed, or are they still present?

would I be better off getting a P4 system?
