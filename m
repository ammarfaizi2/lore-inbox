The smoking gun is very often obtained by dissassembling the device 
firmware or program binaries and/or runing string comparisons.

It's hard to spoil the evidence when all of your customers have it.

I don't know what the world is like where you are (I admit that if 
you're in the States you probably *are* more repressed than I am in the 
UK right now) but you seem to have some extreme paranoia which seems 
more than a little unfounded. The above is completely unnecessary - it 
does nothing that using the GPL already does not do - but you seem to 
have convinced yourself that the real problem here is the GPL.

Jon.
