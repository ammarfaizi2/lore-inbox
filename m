The issue is still unresolved.

I noticed that sometimes I also get this in the kernel log:

hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
hda: DMA timeout error
hda: dma timeout error: status=0xd0 { Busy }

hda: DMA disabled
ide0: reset: success
Loosing too many ticks!
TSC cannot be used as a timesource. (Are you running with SpeedStep?)
Falling back to a sane timesource.

I am not using SpeedStep, so that message must be triggered by the IDE
errors.  The errors only happen when writing very large (hundreds of
megabytes) amounts of data at rate above a few megabytes per second.
It's never happened when just doing normal things like compiling
stuff.
