I've been technical director of an ISP. I help manage sites that have not
insignificant loads and no eepro100 driver problems. For that matter there
are porn sites using eepro100 drivers.

Your information is wrong. But then it usually is. If you are large corporation
and would care to talk to Intel they will be happy to discuss it further.

Of course the single biggest problem with the eepro100 is closedness, and people
in Intel with attitudes like yours who refuse to release full documentation.
