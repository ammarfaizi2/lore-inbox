Who, if anyone, is currently doing Alpha Linux kernel development work?
I'm at a loss to find any cohesive site or community of developers
fixing and maintaining the code.

I'm currently working on using an ES45 with a 2.4.19 kernel, and it
seems that the funcitoning RH 2.4.9-32 has some patching to get AGP
working (added entries in agp_bridge_info and the chipset enum).

I would be more than welcome to forward port the patches to 2.4.19,
aslong as this work isn't being duplicated.

Cheers,
Carlos.
