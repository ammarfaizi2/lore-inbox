It's not an implication, it's a fact.

What would you call it then when I receive a bounce/etc that is in
reponse to a message someone else sent? I certainly never solicited
that.

Perhaps you could send me your snail mail address; I'll solicit some
junk mail but put your address down. But don't call it junk mail when
you receive it, because it was solicited!

IMO one should never have to receive "automatic responses from
messages they didn't send".
