Dear sir, 
Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into
businessraine@deloitte.co.uk <sraine@deloitte.co.uk>s
relationship with you. I got your contact from the
Ivory coast chember of commerce. I prayed over it and
selected your name among other names due to its
esteeming nature and I perssonaly recommend you as a
reputable and trust worthy person I can do business
with though we've not know before and by my
recommendations,I must not hesitate to confide in you
for this simple and sincere business.
 I am Ahmed Jubril, The only son of late Alhaji and
Mrs Ibrahim Jubril . My father was a very wealthy
cocoa and Elephant tusk MERCHANT IN Abidjan, the
capital of Ivory Coast before he was poisoned to death
by his business associates on one of their outing to
discuss on a business deal. Before the death of my
father, he took me so special as his only son that he
promise to prepare my future for better. Since I was
not present on the 29th June 2000, the day he (my
father) died in a private hospital here in Abidjan, he
called my mother on his bedside revealing to her that
he has one metal box contaning the sum of
US$11.200.000 Dollars (Eleven Million, Two Hundrend
Thousand United States Dollars)and 4kgs of raw Gold
left in one of the security company here in Abidjan,he
later handed her over the certificate of deposit and
prove of ownership and that he used my name as his
only son for the next of kin in the deposit of this
fund. He also explained to my mother that it was
because of this money that he was poisoned by his
business associates who doesn't know the actual place
this money was deposited. He also advised me that I
should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where I can transfer this fund and use it for
investment purposes (such as estate management) and
that immediately it is done, I should leave the
country for he fears my security is in danger. I have
already discussed it with my mother and she assured me
that this money will be transferred immediatrely I got
a trust worthy and a genuine pertner overseas. Dear, I
am honourably seeking your assistance for the transfer
of this money which I am sure will open a business
relationship between both of us. Furthermore, you can
indicate your option towards assisting me by email for
us to discuss terms and conditions for this
transactions. Thanks for your co-operations. Yours
sincerely,
 Ahmed Jubril
