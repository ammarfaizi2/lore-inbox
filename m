I can quite believe that.  I wasn't thinking it was a practical suggestion straight away, but there are obviously people on this list who won't be happy until, either we stop using BK or it is GPLed, (OK, or put under another free license).

I am staying out of that argument, but if you're not entirely against the idea of, in a few years, trying to get a few large corporations to sponsor the opening of the source, that might satisfy a few people, and _maybe_, just _maybe_, put an end to this huge thread.  :-)
