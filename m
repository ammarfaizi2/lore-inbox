	Bluntly, you're just completely wrong. If this were so, I could put up a
billboard with a poem and then sue everyone who read it.

	You should read http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html

	Notice, for example, that the rights granted under copyright do *not*
include the right to restrict the *use* of a work.

	Far from copyright law starting out with the premise that you can do
nothing with a work, it basically restricts copying or distribution of a
work and the production of works based on that work other than what's
necessary for ordinary use.

	Specifically, copyright does not protect ordinary use. If you buy a CD, you
get the right to use that CD simply by virtue of the fact that you lawfully
possess a lawfully made of the music on that CD.
