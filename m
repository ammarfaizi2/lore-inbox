Joerg, there is no doubt that you are a talented programmer, but you seem 
lacking in some social graces. I don't believe I am alone in finding it 
personally offensive that you insist on preaching about how wonderful Solaris 
is on a mailing list dedicated to another operating system.

I am asking nicely this one time, but will you please stop preaching about how 
great Solaris is?
