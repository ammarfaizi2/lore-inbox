Except when the work is a computer program.  Check the law sometime!

I recall there is a special exception for computer programs in either
UK or EU law - I forget which, perhaps both.  This exception means
that if I compose some music for a publisher, I cannot give up moral
rights to the work - which means I always have a right to be credited
as author or something like that, and nobody can take that away.
However, if I compose a computer program for a publisher, my moral
right to be credited _is_ taken away.

This _only_ applies to computer programmers.  Bah!
