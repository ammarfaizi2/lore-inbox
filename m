Hello Everybody,
I'm in trouble with this SCSI controller.
I tried, but it's impossible to set up some version of linux with this SCSI
controller.
I need help .. is this device supported by the actual version of kernels?
What the hell is happening?
I've tried to install Mandrake (8.0), Red Hat (5.1, 6.0, 6.2), tried with
Debian too, and will try with Redhat 7.0 and 7.1
How can I get it working?

[]'z
Igor
