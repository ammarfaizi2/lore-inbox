Ummm ... I'm not exactly happy working with Intel's own projections on the
performance of their Itanium chips ... seems a little unscientific ;-)

Presumably when you said "Itanium 2 on 0.13um performs a lot better than P4
on 0.13um." you were referring to some benchmarks you have the results of? 

If you can't publish them, fair enough. But if you can, I'd love to see how
it compares ... Itanium seems to be "more interesting" nowadays, though I
can't say I'm happy about the complexity of it.
