first. what kind of advantages does bk have over other svn? Seriously.
If Apache can use it, and gcc might use it (again two very large
projects), what makes linux so differetnt that it can't.

And I don't want _anything_ from Larry. I am just pointing out, that
this kind of legal clause is more ridicolous than understandable.

Last, why can you compare cvs to bk? and not subversion, or arch? arch
and subversion are way superiour to cvs ...

yes its hard, so we have to use bk with a very strange license?
better close the eyes and not change. What do you think is kernel
coding? Walk in the park? Do you think all those developers say, nah I
better use Windows or Mac OS X, because its hard and not sexy ... pah
... BS!
