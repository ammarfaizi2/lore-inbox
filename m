I see two pictures:

1) Open source does not accommodate binary drivers. In that way hardware 
support is weakened but an increasing number of companies should adopt 
open source drivers because demand increases even without super-duper 
hardware support.

2) Open source does in fact accommodate binary drivers because some 
idiot (me) just took the liberty of starting this project just to see 
what happens. It's exactly the same as when some people go and fork a 
project and everybody says it'll weaken the movement. But something 
could happen: It could be beneficial! Linux get's better hardware 
support, more people adopt it and business begins to realize that maybe 
they should try to co-operate a bit more software-wise. That's what we 
all want them to do, yes?

As of now Linux won't force vendors into creating open source drivers. 
That'd be like a small dog barking.

I here every word when people talk about the benefits of open source 
drivers. But really, think: If all these benefits why isn't there 
anymore open source drivers? And the answer is not "because companies 
are stupid". If we can't make it attractive enough to release driver 
source code then maybe the world just isn't matured yet. And we'll wait. 
But while waiting I want my 3d card to perform better and my mp3-player 
to work.

Bugga, here we went and turned it into opinions =)
