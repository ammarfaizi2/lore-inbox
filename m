The Second Edition of Linux Device Drivers is about to drop out of the
O'Reilly catalog.  When that happens, it is also possible that O'Reilly
will lose interest in hosting the free version of the book.  To help
ensure that LDD2 remains available, I've put a copy onto the LWN server:

	http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD2/

I'll happily keep it there as long as it's useful.

P.S.  LDD3?  Februaryish.
