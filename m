I'll just call you crazy for implying that someone said otherwise.

If you look above, you'll see a statement that the developer said he would 
supply source code only to paying customers, and then a contradiction that 
says the developer did not say that.  It then adds an extra fact to 
explain what the developer _really_ did to create the violation.
