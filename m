Sorry, I said "respect", I didn't mean and say "admire".

Well, as all of the writers and readers of this and other threads are free
people (I hope), he has a choice. I would not critize someone for his personal
choice in such a matter, you may call it wrong from your point of view, but
this is simply called "different opinions".

>From the deepest ground of my heart I would say: YES. He has a right to think,
say and do whatever he likes as long as it does not interfere with rights of
others. I think you left the thread (already quite off-topic for LKML) and got
to the "free speech" topic (completely off-topic for LKML).

This is really a discussion, Rob. In a discussion you will meet all flavors of
people including ones that don't like you or your sayings. Others may even
ignore you completely. I think it's their right to do so. We are discussing a
controverse topic here, so you can expect to convince nobody but yourself.
Nevertheless you are free to talk about your personal opinion, because it gives
others at least a chance to think about it, even if they don't tell you.

Regards,
Stephan
