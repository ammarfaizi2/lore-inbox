I think so. Someone send me a link where there was described that especially 
that 75 GB drives are causing such severe corruption.

But that drives seem to have these errors from the beginning. I just putted off 
the packaging yesterday of that 75 GB drive. Mostly that errors occured when the 
disk was totally off for a moment and only on my root-partition.

Is it possible to detect which file currently own a specific inode ?

Thanks anyway.
