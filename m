Please don't confuse people the standard is clear.
The OEM's are just cheap becous they can controll what they
put in to the box and how they layout the cables inside
the box. If someone asks. The 80 lines are half the same
contacts as before and half signal shilding. So indeed
40 wire cables can turn out to work, but thats subjec to
"quality" assurance on behalf of the OEM's.
