Well, as m gets larger, the number

(n + n^2 + ... + n^(m-1)) / n^m

tends to 1 / (n - 1).

In other words, if you can break n^m, then you can probably break

n + n^2 + ... + n^m

Anyway, I'm not that bothered with making /proc/tty/driver root-only,
even if it is only for what seems to me to be dubious reasons.
