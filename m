Who are you to demand it in the first place.  As far as I can see, 
you've contributed
nothing notable to the kernel development community (But please correct 
me if I'm
wrong).  Why should we listen to you, when you haven't given us reason 
to.  All
you've done is demand things of the LKML, but why should we listen to 
your
demands instead of our own.

If you want things more organized, then please code it up and submit a 
series of
clean patches against the current kernel.  Besides, a lack of 
organization is
sometimes a good thing. (See _The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar_:
<http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/>).

We're not silencing you for airing your views.  If anything, we're 
silencing you
because your views get in the way of us doing real work.  If you want 
to be
productive and give us a clean set of patches, then go ahead, but all 
you're
doing right now is making the signal-to-noise ratio on the LKML worse.

Cheers,
