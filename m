Hi Marcelo,

I was just wondering if support for the Adaptec 79xx had been added to 
2.4.21-pre? I have a server with the dual channel 7902 support on board, 
that so far appears to be working OK. It's using 2.4.20 with the driver 
patched in from Adaptec's site. I found an earlier mail from you stating 
that it would be added during the 2.4.20-pre cycle. Are there problems 
with the driver I should be aware of? Thanks,

-Walt
