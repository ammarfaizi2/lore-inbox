Subject: Memory management problems in 2.4.16
Message-ID: <20020109143434.A20955@ATComputing.nl>

I installed a 2.4.16 kernel on a 486DX2-50 machine with 8MB memory and
24MB swap and got insurmountable problems.
For instance,
$ diff file1 file2
where both files are, say, 6MB, hangs the machine.
One would expect the machine to go swapping and to hear the disk rattle,
but after a few seconds - silence; and no response when typing in a
second virtual console. The only sign of life I get is answer from a
ping from another machine.

The same machine with a 2.2.20 kernel operates as expected.
An strace shows that the last thing that happens, is an mmap of the
first file.

Various other commands that need lots of memory exhibit the same
behaviour.

It seems to me that something definitely is wrong with the kernel's
memory management.

BTW, the kernel is stripped bare bones - no PCI, only IDE, floppy,
serial and networking support. Attached the .config file.

Greetings,

Daniel Tuijnman
