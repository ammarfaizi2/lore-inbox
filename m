The kernel has a driver for the Sun Creator3D card that works on sparc64,

This driver is not in the DRM tree (I'll do that) but also no-one on the
DRI team has one that I know off, so I'm looking for someone to test this
on hardware or has a previously working setup and can check it out for me,

if not it'll probably drift into un-maintained...

Dave.
