An identically configured machine in another building.  A 20-pack of
160GB disks is under $5K; you can even swap out a complete set of
disks and take them offsite since they're all in carriers.

The incredibly low costs of these things have forced a change in how
many of us think about data storage.  Building a 2+TB filesystem is no
longer a sign of insanity or too much money to spend (or both), it's a
weekend project.
