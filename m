Hi Andrew, hi Luc!

I just realized that there is now the pwc driver back in -mm kernels,
but interestingly not the one from Luc, or at least not the last
published one (10.0.6). and wanted to ask if there is a specific reason
for this?

Best wishes

Norbert

CANNOCK CHASE (n.)
In any box of After Eight Mints, there is always a large number of
empty envelopes and no more that four or five actual mints. The
cannock chase is the process by which, no matter which part of the box
often, you will always extract most of the empty sachets before
pinning down an actual minot, or 'cannock'. The cannock chase also
occurs with people who put their dead matches back in the matchbox,
and then embarrass themselves at parties trying to light cigarettes
with tree quarters of an inch of charcoal. The term is also used to
describe futile attempts to pursue unscrupulous advertising agencies
who nick your ideas to sell chocolates with.
