Subject: Re: Cached memory never gets released
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've done more experiments and have gotten rid of *every* kernel change
we've made, and the problem still exists. To summarize:

1) Stock linux 2.4.26 kernel.
2) VIA epia-m motherboard with linuxbios
3) 128M DDR ram
4) 16M devoted to video
5) XFree86 4.3.0
6) Mozilla + x86 flash 6.0 plugin
7) Flash calls for large unicode Japanese font/
8) No swap. System is diskless and its root filesystem is a 2M ramdisk with
symlinks to a read-only NFS mountpoint.

When I repeatedly load a flash page there are a number of problems
A) Due to flash bug 3M of memory gets lost due to font memory getting lost
This isn't the kernel's problem though.
B) The output of "free" cache number steadily grows. Eventually all of
system memory is locked up in the cache and the kernel starts killing processes
to free up resources. A simple malloc/fill program that keeps allocating
memory and filling it until it fails or the kernel kills it will reclaim some
of the cache, but in the end there is a fixed amount that never can get 
released--almost all of the original free memory.
 
The memory leak in A) is associated with the growth rate in B). If I remove
the Japanese font loading mozilla/flash don't leak memory, and the cache
fillup problem is greatly reduced, but it still exists. It just takes a lot
longer to exhaust all of system memory with the cache.

I don't really understand how the kernel manages its cache memory. If
someone could post a function to say dump information about everything that
is in the cache I could integrate that in with the kernel and report results.
Some people have suggested if the cache doesn't have a mapping or if the
buffers are dirty they can't get reclaimed. The filesystem is read-only so
dirty can't apply. I don't know what the mapping means.

Any suggestions welcome. I don't know what else I can do since I'm down to
a stock kernel and so in my mind there is no way we've introduced this problem
somehow.

Thanks--
Dave
