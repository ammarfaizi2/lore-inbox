And that pretty much says it.  Assigned to the Canopy Group.  So SCO 
will have yet another lawsuit to threaten us with.  If they survive 
the thrashing I've Been Moved will give them at the end of the day.

Too bad that you can figure out how to file a patent, but can't figure 
out how to setup an html link.  Why the hell would I want to look at 
the link in kwrite?

Seems like a good question to me.
