Who said that. If only one poerson submits, why not give his address
as maintainer.

I think only the kernel tree is relevant for the MAINTAINER list.

Anyone being able to patch something that really concerns the DVB
relevant hard or software will probably be on the list. Any other
patches will probably concern minor things or changes in the overall
kernel structure.

But how will the person submitting a patch get feedback about the
patch when he or she is not on the list. I don't think a list is a
good idea as a maintainer address.
The problem is not that the patches may or may not go to the list, you
can always forward them anyway. The problem is that some people not
familiar with DVB may have patches but are not that interested in
DVB that they would like to join the list. 
So, you don't have to open the list. You just have to give a different
maintainer address, like dvb-maintainer@convergence.de.
