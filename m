No. Compiling and linking are mechanical,
non-intellectually-novel acts. At most, you have a collective
work where the real intellectually-novel work was to select
what goes into the collective.

Yes. And yes, if you buy a copy of the library, yes (but
notice: not if you downloaded it for free from the Net).

No. The copyright law states that the copyright owner has the
monopolistic right to create derivative works.

No... Try writing a book with Harry Potter as your main
character and JKR's lawyers will be at your door soon.

Please send us some pointers to this statements for the FSF.

Wrong again. GPL, section 0, para 1: "Activities other than
copying, distribution, and *modification* are not covered by
this License". Emphasis mine.

Except for the modification part, which *is* the scope of
regular, Berne-convention-molded copyrights law.

No, we disagree on this too.

This is not the point: you still would have to wipe your ten
computers clean if you want to sell the ten copies you have.

In the GPL'd case, if you disregard the terms of the license,
you can still keep, use, etc. You can *not* copy it,
distribute it, or modify it tough.

The point is: it's *not* a derivative work. period. Yes, first
sale would apply to the same extent that it applies to the
original software.

Ok, let's repeat ourselves:

A derivative work is a novel intellectual creation (of the
spirit) that results from some transformation of another work,
said the "original" work.

There is a similar (identical?) definition on 17 USC, but I am
quoting (bad translation mine) our "Lei 9610/98 -- Lei de
Direitos Autorais" (1998 Brazilian Author's Rights Act), art.
5º, VIII, 'g'.

I can't think of any example where to use a work, you must
create another work transforming the first. If you can, please
enlighten me. Beware: your *spirit* must transform the work,
not your computer. Yes, as when *you* translate a book to
another language, in an non-automatable-non-automated process.

No, no, no, and no. A derivative work is not something that is
"argumentable" :-). There is a clear legal definition, and
there are even tools (the Holy Trinity of Derivation:
Abstraction, Filtration, Comparison) to help us define and
discover what is and what is not a derivative work. And no,
HelloWorld.c is not a derivative work of Windows, even if it
#include<windows.h>

please, google for:

abstraction filtration comparison derivative

-- it will be enlightening.

This would most certainly not prevail in any court at all.
Obviously, IANAL and TINLA applies. But, that said, I have
good credentials :-)
