Helloooo !!! Have you proofs that they have ???

You're always assuming the worst from Free, this is really starting to
be annoying. Just stick to the FACTS and if you want to argue on
something, bring PROOFS !

And even if it was the case, you missed the point here, if they own the
Freebox their point is that they are using Linux for "internal use" only.

Nonsense, you are talking about cases of softwares which were sold to
customers with GPL code inside. This is no such case here.

You obviously need a brain, try to get one and come back after you
learned to use it.
