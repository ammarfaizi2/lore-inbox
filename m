Hi!

It was a long time ago since I tried suspending to S3 on my laptop, but
now it seems to work pretty well. All my hardware is resumed properly,
except my USB mouse that stops working. This is the only USB device I
have, so I can't tell for sure other USB devices would stop working as
well after resuming from S3. However, the built-in PS/2 touchpad works
perfectly after resuming.

The steps to reproduce this are:

1. Log on to X/KDE
2. su to root
3. echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
4. After resuming, all the hardware is functional, but the USB mouse.

dmesg shows timeouts in usb_control/bulk_msg. Also, "lsusb -vvv" hangs
and can't be killed.

Attached to this report is "dmesg" and the "config" file used to build
my kernel. The kernel in question is a 2.6.0-test2 plus the latest ACPI
interim patch, but also happens with 2.6.0-test2-mm3, for example.
