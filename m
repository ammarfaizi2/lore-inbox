Hi, 

My research group is planning to buy a multi-processor linux machine
for parallel computing. Does anyone know how many pentium processors the
linux SMP support? Does it support 8(pentium-three) processors? What
companies produce such reliable multi-processor (>4) machines? Thanks a
lot! 

Xinwei
