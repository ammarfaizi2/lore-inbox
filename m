NOTE:  Under the Doctrine of Esstopel, if you proceed on this basis and 
two years pass without their heirs bringing an action of some sort, then 
under this
legal doctrine, the rights to use their code under GPLv3 would in all 
probability pass consitutional muster.  Again, someone needs to run this 
by an attorney at the FSF and get a formal legal opinion rendered.  The 
Doctrine of Esstopel basically says that if you use something for some 
period of time, and no one
objects, then you obtain certain rights to use it permenantly.  Not 
wanting to disrespect the wishes of the dead, I would attempt to contact 
the successors of
their estates in any event and obtain permission, and if not possible, 
then proceed.
