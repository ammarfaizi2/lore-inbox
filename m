Hi,

Thanks for the doc and for answering the FAQs.

Do you know of a list of current issues or problems with the reiser4 
code that need to be resolved prior to a merge or another review? I have 
looked around and the mailing list archives only contain one review and 
the issues pointed out in there (aside from the VFS integration debate) 
have been resolved as far as I can tell.

I would like to jump in and perhaps help reiser4 along by trying to fix 
any simple issues, but I am unable to find any specifics as to why it is 
not being merged in its current state. Is there any message or page I am 
missing?

Thanks,
LL
