Hans said "Wow, I would never have guessed our market share was that 
high as 1/5th of ext3."

And estimate of the marked share based on klive data is simply wrong.

wrongly try to estimate a marked share based on klive data (and it seems 
you missed the smiley after the last paragraph of my email).
