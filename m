Hi, everyone..  I'm borrowing my roommate's email, so please send replies to
andyw@edafio.com.  Thanks!

Here's my problem...  when I boot anything 2.4, I get several oopsen in a
row, all of which are either (most commonly) kernel paging request could not
be handled, or (much less common) unable to handle kernel Null pointer
dereference.  I will send any info on request, but here's my hardware and
kernel config:

iWill KKR-266R (Via 8363 Northbridge, 686B south)
AMD tbird 1GHz
256MB cas2 pc133 sdram
ATI Radeon DDR 64MB VIVO
Kingston KNE120TX (Realtek 8139 chip)
SBLive! 5.1
IBM GXP75 30GB (on the via ide controller)
Pioneer 16x dvd
ls120

This happens regardless if I turn on swap or not.  When swap is on, it is a
128MB partition (and yes, I'm aware of the recommendation of 2x RAM, but I
believe I read somewhere that someone was working on that, and I didn't want
to waste the extra 384MB on swap).

Is there anything I can do to fix this?

-- andyw

p.s., booting with devfs=nomount is better, but still causes oopsen (I get
to a login prompt, but if I do much more than mount a disk a copy to it, the
system freaks)
