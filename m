Correct me if I'm wrong, but we're here to work out the problems. That's 
one of the major meanings of "development", in my experience.

I was bitten too: I loaded my 2.4.19 configuration and looked through most 
options, but I overlooked this keyboard/mouse thing. I think it's not 
turned on by default if you load an existing configuration, which is 
probably not what we want.
