Hello,

I have been working to get "Riven" the sequel to Myst to work with the 
latest wine from
cvs on the latest FC5. It works and the sound is almost perfect with 
OSS, but is totally
screwed up when I use ALSA, I don't know whether this is a WINE or Linux 
issue, so I
am cross posting to both lists.

Regards,
Steve
