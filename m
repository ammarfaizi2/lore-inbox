hi,

the via-rhine network-driver was originally coded by donald becker who
seems to have stopped working on it 2001 and has since then been modified
by several people like Jeff Garzik, Justin Guyett, Urban Widmark, Dave Miller
and so on.

unfortunately, there are no email-adresses of these persons. does anyone
know how to contact the via-rhine developers, since I am seeing problems
with the VT6103.

thanks,
h.rosmanith
