Well, that was just an unfortunate "bug".

Declaring interfaces "stable" makes as much sense as all the other
tries to define crazy enterprise "standards" nobody follows in real
world.

In a developing environment, interfaces _become_ stable and don't get
_declared_ by anybody as such. We are not talking about syscall
interfaces or things that are simple enough to be kept stable, if you
cross a certain level of complexity, you just can't apply these rules
anymore.

Interfaces mature over the time they get used. Only the _use_ of it
collects the needed information to form the model behind it. They get
improved up to the point that changing the interface causes more
pain than it's worth this change. Then an interface has _become_ "stable"
cause it makes sense at that point.

"by the time we have any _users_ interface should be stable", that's
such a nonsense. If you don't have any user, you don't know if this
interface works at all and only if it gets used you get the needed
feedback to improve it.
