In any case, Larry's suggestion would fracture Linux. Also, Solaris might
be a fine piece of work, but what is commonly called Linux (i.e.,
distributions) is more flexible, easier to use, and friendly
overall. Besides, the kernel handles an insane selection of hardware, and
is able to interoperate with allmost everything else there is. No mean
feat, that one.
