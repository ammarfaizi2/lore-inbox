Hi All !
  Being a newcomer to this list, i have a question which may seem very
general but i would appreciate any help regarding my query.
  The problem is that i have to recompile the linux kernel by setting the
TCP/IP  debug option as TRUE. And secondly, why do you think anyone wold
be interested in doing this ?
