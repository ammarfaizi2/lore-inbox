RE: TRANSFER OF ($26,000.000.00 USD} TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS.

I want to transfer ($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States Dollars from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to oversea account. First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction.This is by virtue of it's nature as being u
tterly confidential. I am sure and have confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of this great magnitude.

I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your safe account for unward investment.You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can s
erve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am the personal account officer to a great late INDUSTRIALIST who has an account in one of the top banks here in South Africa. The account was opened in 1998 and he died in 2000 without a written or oral WILL and since 2000 nobody has operated on thi
s account again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of the company. My investigation through the National immigration
department proved to me as well that he was single as at the point of his entry into the Republic of South Africa. The amount in this account is USD$26 Million ( Twenty six Million United States Dollars ) only.

As a matter of fact, I have decided to transfer this fund abroad for investment. Your assistance as a foreigner is necessary because the management of the bank will welcome any foreigner who has correct information to this account which I will give yo
u immediately, if you are interested to do this business with me.There is no risk to this business. With my position and my personal contact with the manager of the bank, the money can be transferred to any account you can provide with assurance tha
t this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing.

We will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000]. Upon successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of $20 million to your account. I am only contacting you a
s a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, but can only be approved to any foreigner who has the correct information of the account which I will provide to you.

So you should provide me with your correct account detail where you will like the fund to be transferred or you can set up a new account for the transfer even an empty account is ok.

At the conclussion of the transfer you will take 35% for you, 5% for any expenses incurred in this business and the remaining 60% for me. As soon as I hear from you and upon your strong assurance that you will not let me down once the fund goes into you
r account I will then start to process the transfer of the fund to your account without further delay.

Contact me urgently for further detail.in my private e-mail box:matt_noah2003@zwallet.com


Thanks. 
Yours Faithfully, 
DR NOAH.
