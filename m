Hello!


I installed glibc 2.3.4 with the options

--enable-kernel=2.4.1 --enable-add-ons=linuxthreads --prefix=/usr
--disable-static

and installed it. Afterwards, I'm getting oopses with kernel 2.4.x (kernel
2.6.10 works fine). X itself segfaults.

ksymoops 2.4.1 on i686 2.4.29-pre3.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.29-pre3/ (default)
     -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)

Warning: You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will
assume that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running
right now and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.

8 warnings issued.  Results may not be reliable.


If I'm compiling glibc 2.3.3 on the totally same system as glibc 2.3.4,
all works fine afterwards with both kernels.


Could anybody give me a hint, please?


Kind regards,
Andreas Hartmann
