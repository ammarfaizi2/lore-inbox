In reality, California has no power shortage. The problem is deregulation and greed together causing an artificial power shortage. Tell those of us in San Diego
that we're using too much power and there's a shortage. We started conserving a year before the "shortage" - an average of 20% in fact - and we still had
blackouts and higher rates and were told to cut back even more or pay even more. But, this thread digresses.

At our rates, you're darn right it is. An average PC costs ~$.05 per hour to run in California.
