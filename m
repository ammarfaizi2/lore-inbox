Hi folks,

If I get the DVD stuff working, then I won't need NT anymore, i.e.
I will have an empty disk.

What is your impression about ReiserFS? Does it work? Is it stable
enough for my daily work, or is it something to try out and watch
carefully? Do you use ReiserFS for your boot partition?

Or should I try ext3 instead?


Regards

Harri
