I'm afraid the ALSA drivers aren't be the best examples :)
It doesn't handle the error in suspend/resume at all.

Anyway, you can find suspend/resume callbacks in linux/sound/pci and
subdirectories (e.g. atiixp.c, es1968.c, intel8x0.c...)
Note that suspend/resume prototype is different from pci callbacks to
be interated with the power handler on ALSA control API.

Hmm, looking at them right now, and i found most of them don't have
pci_suspend_state() because it worked without saving/restoring the pci
state _casually_, and missing pci_set_power_state(), etc...
Using "standard" functions would be easier to fix such things.

Ok, agreed.
Providing functions to do the standard jobs would suffice.
