One reaseon might be that the framebuffer devices can cause problems,
e.g. with proprietary X drivers.

Ignoring my suspicion that people won't like stuff getting forced down
their throats like this (why would a DRM _require_ a framebuffer
device?), does the hotplug blacklisting of the framebuffer devices
matter at all if the DRM depends on them, i.e. won't they be loaded
regardless when the DRM is loaded?
