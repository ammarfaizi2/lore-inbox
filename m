Would you volunteer to do the same thing for kernel API changes for those
of us who don't pay enough attention to the list?

I have a few random drivers that aren't in mainline, so i always wind up
porting to new kernels (they're trivial, so it's not a big deal, but
sometimes it's annoying to find changes).

Or is someone else already doing this wonderfully sexy job?
