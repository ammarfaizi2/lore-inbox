I see binary drivers as a problem, too.
How does a customer find out, if a piece of Hardware works in the free software
world? Yes there are a few places, where you find a hardware compatibility list,
but these are scattered and often incomplete. And they only include hardware
that someone thinks is working, added a couple of month after sales launch.

The only solution is to create pressure on these companies, as suggested.
Ideally, there should be a label "designed for Linux" (or "designed for free
software" (maybe getting the bsd people on board as well?)) straight on the box.
So customers that start to care about linux, can see this right away and make
the right choice, when buying hardware. 
And because the driver is already included/licensed before the product makes it
into the shelves, its a plug and play scenario for the customer. They don't need
to worry about drivers at all. Stick it in and it just works(tm).
This would be a real value added in favor of linux for the customer and could
create some real pressure on companies with binary only drivers. 


Which Authority would be best to release such a Label?

Dirk
