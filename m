Hi,

I reported some snd_hda_intel problem a month ago. I have been using 2.6.15-21
perfectly, but with 2.6.16 or even git 2.6.17-rc2 it is still going like at
1.2x the speed it should go (1x is ok). You can notice Music will actually go
faster and it may sometimes chipmonk.

Please let me know what exact info is required if interested. This is on a
Compaq V2000 Ubuntu Dapper Drake up to date and with 2.6.15-X it has worked
perfectly and still is, until 2.6.16 or higher is loaded.

Thanks,

.Alejandro
