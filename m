There are no bugs in windows, only features. :-))
(or it's a hardware problem :-) )
As i recall windows is not shiped with a
known-bugs.txt
or similar to tell you about it's hidden features.
:-))

Thanks for help in the fanning problem.  
I don't have a temperature sensor, so i have to
inspect
the case to see if the cooling fan is working.
Right now it's stopped (again)

Bye

P.S. Thanks again for the mail. I woldn't look at the
fan if you would'n write to me so something terrible
could happend... :-))
