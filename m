This comment was suboptimal, Rik.
There is a group of people that can _make_ one, but there is only one that can _release_ it.
No need to discuss if I am a member of the group, but for sure neither me nor you are _the one_.
So we both can do no more than state our personal opinions on the matter.

Some more thoughts while I am at it:

It is the nature of critics to focus on small bits of the picture. That does not mean the whole picture is teared down just from criticising _some part_ of it. 

It is the nature of critics that you can always learn something from it. If it is not about the underlying matter it is at least about the person speaking up.

And: please keep in mind that there are (at least) two major groups in this list: one consisting of people getting paid from distro-(and other-)companies to do something useful about linux - and one consisting of people _not_ getting paid for it. It is very obvious that the lines-of-code-for-patches from single heads inside the second group may be a bit less than from the first. This is not necessarily related to the respective persons' knowledge about linux and related issues.

Regards,
Stephan

I see, you know what I am talking about.
