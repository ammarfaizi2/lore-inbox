This all hasn't been true for a very long while.

Not *that* may be very true, and your GUI indeed looks very very promising.
Elsewhere you note regarding removing your sysprof.o code:

You'll find this work orders of magnitude easier than convincing people that
we need yet another profiling system in the kernel.

So I urge you, keep the cool gui but adapt it to oprofile. I'm sure John
will be more than willing to work with you to make sure oprofile
supports/will support everything you need.

Ok?
