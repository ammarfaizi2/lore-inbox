Hi all,

I've got an Dell Precision 610MT, with dual Xeon 550mhz processors,
440GX chipset, 768mb of RAM, and an HPT302S PCI IDE controller, which
I've been using now for most of the 2.6.x series.  I have two 120gb WD
disks on there, each as the master on it'w own channel.  I'll try
putting both disks on one channel later on tonight if I get a chance.

Here's the lspci info on the controller:

00:0d.0 RAID bus controller: Triones Technologies, Inc. HPT302 (rev 01)

Starting with 2.6.5-rc2-mm5, and continuining into 2.6.5-rc3, if I'm
running 'badblocks' against the drive, and then do a 

	cat /proc/ide/hpt366

The disk just dies, and all hell breaks lose.  When this first
happened, I didn't think of software problems, so I just got the drive
RMA'd and put in a new one.  I then re-synced the MD mirror which it's
part of, and kept going.  But while I was doing the re-sync, I did a
"cat /proc/ide/hpt366" to see how the drives were recognized.  Wham!
The new drive died and started reporting all kinds of block errors.
smartctl also started reporting wierd info.  

So I've rebooted the system, and run badblocks against the disk
without any problems:

  > sudo badblocks -b 8192 -o /var/tmp/badblocks-hdg-2.txt -p1 -s -v -w
  > /dev/hdg
  Password:
  badblocks: bad block size - 8192
  jfsnew:~> sudo badblocks -o /var/tmp/badblocks-hdg-2.txt -p1 -s -v -w
  > /dev/hdg
  Checking for bad blocks in read-write mode

  Testing with pattern 0x00:  80452096/117220824

Until I interrupted it.  Now here's what I get when I do the cat of
/proc/ide/hpt366 while running badblocks.  This is from
/var/log/messages:

Apr  4 19:53:18 jfsnew kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev hdg, sector 3458712


I also hear a loud "click" and the drive seems to spin down.  I've tried doing a reset of the drive using 'hdparn -w' but no luck, only a reboot seems to do anything here.

My .config file is attached as well.  Help!
