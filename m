Hmm, strang i don't have problems with historic software. I just
installed the libc5-packages and everything works fine. (SuSE & Debian.
Maybe the libc5-package(s) (is/are) missing in RedHat)

AFAIK even libc4-programms would run, if you install the necesary
librarys and setup the system youself. But as i don't have any libc4
programs anymore i haven't tried it.
