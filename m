Please check! Are these your private backup files?
This gap in the tsx-11 archives is old.

Thanks for telling me. In fact, when he first asked,
I made my archive available, but he didnt notice right away
and after a few days he had collected almost all the kernels
that I had in my collection. Then I wrote him once more
and he added the last bit, making his collection equal to mine.

I am always looking for missing bits, but disks were small
in those days, and very little survives.
Probably old CDs (or floppies) are the best chance.
[In case anyone has these: I would be interested in old libc
sources as well, say libc-4.4 and earlier.]
