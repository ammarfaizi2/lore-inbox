Larry's proposing to turn BitKeeper into an automated GPL enforcement machine, 
even poking it's nose into areas the GPL isn't concerned about.  This is a
horribly broken reason for adding let more t&c's do the license.

Frankly, I'm finding the whole BitKeeper experience something of a turn-off.
This is clearly not 'just for fun'.  OK, I'll make a very serious effort to
stay out of this now.

When I came into this I had a high regard for BitKeeper and every intention
of using/supporting it.  That's changed, now that I have a feeling for the
mob mentality behind it.
