Sorry, started to get a bit off-topic.  Not trolling, though no matter
what the topic and no matter what the list, people always assume that
I'm a troll when they first meet me.  I guess they don't realize that I
think differently.  If you get used to me, you'll realize that I'm just
crazy and can either ignore me (plonk me as Larry McVoy did) or laugh at
me.  

Whatever you do, I laugh at myself in the end too, and won't be insulted
-- I am proud to report that I take four different psychiatric
medications, and still have hallucinations and delusions regularly, so I
certainly won't claim to be normal by any standard.

Of course, on an intelligence test given at the hospital (same one that
diagnosed me as schizoaffective), I was scored as "high superior
intelligence" which (to you) might mean that there's a chance there's
something useful that might occasionally come out of my mouth.  It's
doubtful, but if plonk me, you'll never know.

-Rob
