Looking back over the archives, the 'other' thread I was thinking
about was the preceding thread to the one you quoted:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.0/1608.html

The thread you point to was the final thread, but you
were missing the follow ups where other changes were
requested even after Andrew's post:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0606.1/0489.html

I think at that point (it has been a while), having just heard
'do this and your OK' from Andrew, but other people still wanting
something else I got frustrated, said 'no more' and stopped.

In hind sight, I should have ignored the posts that followed
and posted what Andrew suggested. When I look at this again,
I will take that approach.
