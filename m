Hi all,

Just another release for the 2.2 kernel tree.
Many people still uses 2.2 and also wants it
instead 2.4 tree for some good reasons.

So i've decided to make also a 2.2 Patchset.
It is not so big like wolk, but nice.

Downloadable also at http://sf.net/projects/wolk

- Based on 2.2.21 Final


2.2.21-1 includes the following Patches:

- OpenWall 3
- HAP 5 for OpenWall 3
- Stealth Networking
- RAID (Autodectect ...)
- Ext3 Filesystem Support
- IFF Dynamic Patch
- PPPoE
- CryptoAPI including CIPE
- Extended Attributes and ACL Support for ext2
- Some NIC Driver Updates/New Adds
- Adaptec AIC7xxx v6.2.4 Driver
- Most Patches of the AA-Kernel v2.2.20 Tree
- OpenSSL v0.9.5-mppe
- ReiserFS v3.5.34 (not working, fix the conflicts with ext3)
- New IDE from Andre Hedrick v2.2.20
- BIGMEM (highmem) to allocate Memory >1GB
- USAGI v20020513-2.2.20
- BadRAM / BadMEM
- FreeS/WAN v1.97

Want to see a patch included to this tree? Let me know! :-)
