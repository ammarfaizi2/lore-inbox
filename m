My wife still uses Applix, which I purchased when Red Hat first
started selling it.  The kernel runs it just fine.  Interestingly
enough, Red Hat no longer ships the shared libs that it uses,
but installing the necessary rpms from Red Hat 6.0 makes it work.
I looked at the dates on the binaries and they are from 1996,
but I am pretty sure they are substantially older than that.
I do appreciate you putting effort into binary compatability.
My wife would be quite upset with me if Applix quit working :-)
