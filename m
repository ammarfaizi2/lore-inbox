Menuconfig doesn't work. Worked fine in 2.4.2-ac5.

Error message:

Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:

Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also

which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
