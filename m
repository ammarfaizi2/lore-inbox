Hello.

I'm looking to start work in the next half-year to year on a filesystem
  with LDAP and then maybe later someSQL backing.  Where's a good place
  to start?  I'm going to have a look at NFS, because I think I might
  be able to use its interface into the kernel (I'm planning on making
  it a userspace daemon).  Maybe autofs, although I think that's a
  different interface.
Any recommendations on what I should read before delving in?  Books,
  articles, web sites, code bases are all fair game.
Thanks!

-Joseph
