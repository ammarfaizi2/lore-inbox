What's the point? There can be no difference between the meaning of
EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() anyway.

ยง6 of the GPL says "You may not impose any further restrictions on the
recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein."

If there was really a meaningful difference between EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()
and EXPORT_SYMBOL(), then the GPL _itself_ would forbid the use of
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() within the kernel, because that would impose
additional restrictions.

We should abolish the meaningless distinction between the two, because
it only encourages people to believe that EXPORT_SYMBOL() can be used
for non-GPL code. Either use EXPORT_SYMBOL() for everything, or switch
to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() for everything. It doesn't really matter.
