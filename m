I thought this would be simple, but...

Could someone point me at the info on calling conventions to be used
with
x86 processors.  I need this to write asm code correctly and I suspect
that it is a bit more formal than the various comments I have found in
the sources.  Is it, perhaps an Intel doc?  Or a gcc thing?
