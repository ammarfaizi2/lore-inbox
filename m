1) I was not aware that 'Linux' came with Victor's stuff.

2) If I was truly an Open Source priest, I would not care whether
   another person made money off my work. Only non-Open Source
   priests, or fake Open Source priests are concerned with such
   things. Any true Open Source priest knows that people will not
   use non-Open Source products by the end of this millenia.
