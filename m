Geert,

Thank you for your quick reply.

I agree with you. I will try to upgrade it.

We have ported 2.6.0 kernel, and we are still working to add drivers. 
But I hope we can release it soon.  :-)

The m32r kernel also supports the wonderful features of 2.6 kernel 
like other architecture.
 - O(1) scheduler support
 - Preemtible kernel support
 - SMP support
