Hello all :))

    I've reading a bit about booting Linux within Linux, and I'm
pretty interested in this issue. The point here is, will a stable
kernel support this in a near future?.

    There are a few alternatives like 'LOBOS' (which, IMHO, is the
most portable, easy and small of all), 'bootimg', the two kernel
monte, etc...

    This will be very useful for a lot of thinks: netbooting, initrd
replacement, kernel switching and testing, etc...

    Have you think about adding this to the kernel. It won't enlarge
the kernel and IMHO is a very good thing to have. Of course I'm not a
kernel guru and I don't know what kind of problems this would arise.

    Have fun :)
    Raúl
