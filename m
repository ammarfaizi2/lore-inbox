Um, I don't think you presonally know why most linux kernel developers
are working. Some work to make a technically superior OS. Some work
for idealogical reasons.

I suspect not many are "focused on bringing Linux to the attention of
EVERY desktop user" because they are not interested in that. That's a
job for someone in suits. And just because you think they shoudl be
focussed on that doesn't mean they should be.
