Dear Arief,


I Apologize, If this thread has existed before, and so if
this is very offtopic and tiredsome for most of you here.

I'm a newbie, and just about to get my feet wet into the
world, been living in (ASIA/)Indonesia (or whatever the name
is, I personally don't really care, I caremost at the
nationalist excellence) for the last two years, I personally
think it's a toupper(great); country.

But after recently reviewing some Malaysian based systems, I began
to wonder. And these are my questions (I'm trying to avoid 
flame and being a troll here, so if there's any of my 
questions is not on technical basis, or are being such a 
jerk troll please just trash filter my name and email address):

1. In what technical area of the countries are Indonesia and Malayasian 
differ?
2. How are they different countries? What are the technical reasoning 
behind the decisions?

3. Is there any group of ruler from each country that 
review each other policies, and tries to make the best civil life 
out, or is the issues very country specific (something that 
work best in Indonesia might not be so on Malaysia or Phillipines or 
Singapore)?

4. Any chance of merging the very best part of each country?
5. Or is it possible to do so?


Anything else that matters, are welcome.

Please answer technically, I don't wanna be a troll here, 
and I hope so do everyone that answers this. I really like 
to learn, not to read some flame of who's the best.

To freebsd and openbsd list, please CC the answer to me 
directly, as I don't get response from the majordomo of my 
subscription requests, yet.


Best Regards,

arief_mulya
