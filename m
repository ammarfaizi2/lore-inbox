The Libre Software Meeting (LSM) is a yearly event that has been
organized since the year 2000 by the French Free Software Community. LSM
will take place this year in Dijon, from July 5th to July 9th.  It
gathers people from various regions of the world, and comprises both
technical conferences where Free Software developers meet and discuss,
and societal talks about ethical and legal issues relevant to the Free
Software Movement.  Access to the conference is free (as in "free
speech") and free (as in "free beer").  More information is available
from the LSM website:

   http://libresoftwaremeeting.org/

The "Operating System Design and Implementation" topic this year will
gather a wide range of developers and researchers in this area.  A full
program is available online:

The topics that will be discussed include:

   o the design of flexible OSes, namely the GNU Hurd (by Gaël le
     Mignot), Plan 9 (by Charles Forsyth) and the THINK framework (by
     Juraj Polakovic);

   o improving OS security by design, in EROS (by Jonathan Shapiro, Johns
     Hopkins University) and in the port of the GNU Hurd to the L4
     microkernel (by Marcus Brinkmann);

   o dependability, using open proofs in Coyotos (by Jonathan Shapiro) or
     through device driver isolation (by Joshua LeVasseur, Universität
     Karlsruhe);

   o resource management, in particular a novel approach for the GNU Hurd
     on L4 (by Neal Walfield), an evaluation of the Linux memory
     management subsystem (by Mel Gorman), and the "scheduler activation"
     abstraction as a foundation for user-level parallelism (by Vincent
     Danjean);

   o virtualization with User-Mode-Linux (by Jeff Dike);

   o distributed OSes, namely Kerrighed (by Christine Morin, Renaud
     Lottiaux and Pascal Gallard) and openMosix (by Moshe Bar);

   o the use of high-level and special-purpose programming languages in
     OSes (by Julia Lawall, Ewout Prangsma, Frode Vatvedt Fjeld, Jérémy
     Bobbio and Xavier Grave);

   o the implementation of an OS step-by-step (by David Decotigny and
     Thomas Petazzoni).


Proceedings will be available online after the conference.  For more
