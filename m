Does anyone know if patches exist against the stock RedHat 7.1
kernel(2.4.2-2) to support remote kernel debugging(kgdb).  I would also be
interested in the same for kdb, but I'm primarily interested in kgdb.

If it doesn't exist I guess I will have to try to port the patches over
myself, I just didn't want to reinvent the wheel.

hopefully TIA,
michael
