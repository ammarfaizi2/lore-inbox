BK found another bad hard drive today, on our netwinder.  The disk is dieing
badly unfortunately and I don't have installation media for this beast.
I suspect I can go find it but does anyone know of a faster build platform
for arm?  Russell uses bk on arms (no kidding, that's amazing) and so we
continue to support it but that netwinder is just amazingly slow.  If there
is a faster platform we want one.

Thanks.
