The source code is available to those with the binaries,
just as the GPL requires.  AFAIK everyone's said so far
that they not only meet the GPL requirements they feed
the changes they do make back to the community as well
as to their customers.

SO WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?

Why do you need access to a source tree
if you're not even using the product????????

It's nazi fascist BS like this that makes companies shy away from Linux.
