	   i meant no personal affront to yourself or RedHat; i just
   thought i'd let you know why myself (and i'm sure many others)
   don't use your distro anymore.  i did label that little comment
   with a "<rant mode="flame">", now didn't i? ;)

One is allowed to flame only if they get their facts
straight :-)

	   BTW, if someone did say we were a bunch of pinheads, i'm
   sure we would listen and ask "why?" then try to fix what was making
   us pinheads, not just dismiss it by saying, "oh, everyone else is a
   pinhead too".

We already know we are a bunch of pinheads wrt. the userland compiler
issue, full stop.  It need not be restated several hundred more times.
Believe me, after such a large fiasco, we have listened :-)

But, on the other hand, to say that "kgcc" comceptually is something
only Red Hat has ever done is a factual error, that is all I am trying
to state, nothing more.
