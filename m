You seem to think I'm against Bitkeeper, or its use, or that I think
Bitkeeper isn't helping linux.  You're wrong.  I am against carrying what
*appears* to be a big advertisement for Bitkeeper itself in the Linux
source tree.  This I see as akin to putting up a commercial billboard in a
public park.  Would you be comfortable with that?

If my comments have caused increased interest in Bitkeeper and spiked up
Larry's downloads, I am glad.  Now everybody is happy except a number of
those whose involvement with Linux is based on some kind of philosophical
belief in the freeness of software (or at least in the freeness of Linux)
and who have been on the butt end of numerous insults in this thread,
your insult above ("zealots") being a good example.

I have suggested carrying a URL instead.  Is it reasonable?  Who is being
extreme here?

Furthermore, who is making the vicious attacks, and why?
