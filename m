Hey mom&dad,

Just wanted to write you and let you know how that de_gree program I 
tried out went... 

Well 2 weeks later, I graduated, & finished my masters in less then 2 weeks with No Study Required and  1_0_0_%  Verifiable!

Yeah, I know you guys  doubted it at first,but  this turned out to be ,1.0,0% legit!
 The op,portunity exists due to a legal loophole allowing some established colleges to award degre.es  at their dis.cretion.

I'm so excited mom and dad this was a life altering opp,ortunity & for once in my life I took advantage of it.
 I already have jobs that wouldn't of gave me a chance before calling me off the hook now! This really is a Godsend.

Tell my sister and cousin Joey they better hurry up and call that # i gave them the other day because counselor James said they aren't excepting 
many more students for this offer. here are the deg,rees they offer,  

B/A,  B,S,C,  M/A  M,S.C,  M.B.A,  P,h,D
and the number  to c,all again  1-2,0,6,-338-5780  tell them to leave brief message of the de,gree they want, and they will call back ASAP.



Anyways, much love and tell the rest of the family I said hello :)
love your son,Brant

But, I spent the next three weeks making a piece of simple software for her son to her specifications. While I was at it, I put 4-8 pictures on the screen as well. The simple program was finished and ready for her child to see. As I was presenting it, the other children in my classroom were pushing each other to get to the computer screen to touch that Touch Window and hear the word spoken again and again. I looked at these kids and was amazed. There was no music, no animation, nothing cute about this program at all, just real pictures with real words. I was stunned. I just watched the children. Within 10 minutes, several children who had never said a word in their life, made approximations of several words. I was hooked..
I don't practice reading once a week..
Don't you practice dancing as often as possible?.
Haven't you disliked reading?.

I could go on and on, but I won't. We have many programs the children love. But I would give them ALL up to keep my BORING noun program. I thank THE PARENT daily for her insight..
Every child communicates in some form whether it be by crying, body language, facial expressions or verbalization. Some children talk early, some late, some with augmentative communication devices, some not at all. As a teacher I wanted to facilitate the child learning language..
Doesn't Sarah remember shouting slowly?.
