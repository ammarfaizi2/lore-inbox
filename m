It was the original reason Gnome was started. Trolltec had released thier
toolkit for "free" but not GPL. They then changed the licence a bit, but I
think they still have some (lot?) control over the toolkit. I believe the
KDE group did start a re-work to implement an independant version, but I
don't know how that went.
