hello all,

I've been working on a cpu board (which is arm based, but not relevant
in this issue, IMO) which does _not_ have dynamic bus sizing
capability.

the way the board is setup is that there is memory region for both
8bit access and 16bit access for same bus address, so that one can use
either region for appropriate bus width access.

the problem is, however, that because there is two memory region for
one bus address, I have to call two request_region()s to avoid misuse.

what i'd like to ask is that "is anyone using such kind of board to
run linux? if so, how do you do?"

I just got sick fixing device driver everytime using on the board. ;p

tia,
