Hi all,

I was trying to compile the kernel 2.4.14 and I had the following error
message during the installation of the loopback device module

find kernel -path '*/pcmcia/*' -name '*.o' | xargs -i -r ln -sf ../{}
pcmcia
if [ -r System.map ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  2.4.14; fi
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.14/kernel/drivers/block/loop.o
depmod:     deactivate_page

can someone help me?

Atthached there is my config file.
