It is.. the definition of spam sent to spamcop is often "mail I don't
want"  That listing is even more pointless than the ones we get from
customers who forgot they signed up for things and then complain there
first instead of using our list removal system.

Worse yet because spamcop munges the headders we can't actually remove the
complaining user.
