One interface that provides an easy mechanism for posting attachments
is Bugzilla.  See http://bugzilla.gnome.org.  If you open a bug report,
you can add file attachments after initially creating the bug.
Something similar might work very well for the LKML needs.
All that is really required is a web server, some Bugzilla-like
method of pointing to a file and having that get posted to the
web server.  Then, a unique link to the posted file can be returned
that the user can then send along to LKML.
