I'm surprised that this David (me) actually got through to the Goliath :)

Let me publicly thank Intel NIC team [and related persons] for some 
great work.  You guys have really been responsive both to technical 
issues and also political/community-related issues like this one of 
opening docs.

This is a situation where I really think that opening docs will lead to 
a better overall user experience with Intel hardware on Linux, and 
hopefully serves as a model for other vendors to follow.

Thanks and kudos, Intel!

	Jeff
