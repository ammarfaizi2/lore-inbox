No errors...

Btw: As far as I know did the problem occur since I patched 2.4.5 with ac13 or 
ac15. Maybe a clean 2.4.5 works fine. I'm not sure about this. It's some time 
ago... Did you have made some important ext2-related changes with 2.4.5-ac?. I 
could revert to the old kernel and test him if it is relevant.
