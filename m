	Perhaps you could cite the law that restricts to the copyright holder the
right to restrict the distribution of derivative works. I can cite the laws
that restrict all those other things and clearly *don't* mention
distribution of derivative works.

	This would, of course, only make sense if you *had* to agree to the license
to *create* the derivative work. If you were able to create the derivative
work under first sale or fair use rights, then the restrictions in the
contract would not apply to you.
