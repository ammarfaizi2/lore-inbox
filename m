There is one important difference there: Publishing ecryption outside
the US was and is completely legal (apart from stupid local rules). 

In the case of the DMCA, it has been shown that someone who publishes
a "circumvention device" outside the US can be arrested once in the
US.

In this case "the bug" could be labelled "circumvention device":
Suppose the bug is a "remote buffer overflow" (*) then if you have
copyrighted info on your server which is programmed so that that
non-paying people can't access the copyrighted material. Someone with
knowledge of the bug will be able to break in an access the
copyrighted material.

Anyone who publishes the bug risks getting arrested if they set foot
in the US.
