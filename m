So, are you saying, right now in front of the whole community, that you only 
use Linux because you can develop on it?  That if it wasn't for GCC you would 
be playing Minesweeper right now?  

I know thats not what you are saying, but thats how you come across.  We 
always tell everybody who would listen that Linux can hold its own as an 
operating system.  Not just because the code is open, and not just for the 
development environment.  Linux can hold its own because it is *good*.  Not 
perfect (there is no perfect operating system), but when you put it against 
its peers, it rises to the top (<bigotry>along with its other unix 
cousins</bigotry>). 

So why wouldn't linux be ideal for an embedded situation.  Why wouldn't an 
open MP3 player be a better option that Media Player?  We can't we use the 
security, stability and power of Linux for a a suite of PIMs and Doom?I

Be proud of your operating system - you have 32 bits of multitasking power 
and stability, and you can fit it into 512K.  Lets see Redmond try that!
