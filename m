My friend Bjoern has forgotten to write that we actually checked the memory with only 32GB and kernel booted normally. 
The problem appears when we want to put more, even just next 4GB, over the 32GB. It seems to be a kernel problem to me. 
Will try to retrive and send oops tonight.

Thanks for any suggestion!
