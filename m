Sorry if my mail has been bouncing. I've been experimenting with some
configurations and I am moving tomorrow so my domain/IP will be changing.

Whoever, deleted me from list, thanks. Please don't block sh0n.net though
from posting.

I'll read myself when my new IP is added to my domain.

Thank you.
Shawn.
