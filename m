Hi,

since I've not got a feedback from you about joining my patch archive I
will maintain a description file for you (until you decide to maintain it
by yourself). Please have a look at http://linux-patches.rock-projects.com/
and tell me if the description file I use is OK for you.

Since I don't maintain the patch, this description file won't be
up-to-date all the time. That's why it would be better if you could
maintain it by yourself.

greetings,

  - clifford
