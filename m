Thank you, this was not meant to read "a problem with bkbits.net" :)

Powered by linux-2.5.72-mm1, compiled with gcc-2.95-3 because it's rock solid

My current linux related activities in rough order of priority:
- Testing of Swsusp for 2.4
- Learning 2.5 kernel debugging with kgdb - it's in the -mm tree
- Studying 2.5 serial and ide drivers, ACPI, S3

The 2.5 kernel could use your usage. More info on setting it up at
