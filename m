Hi Jeff,

  Hmm.... Paul is around his email just changed and the pmac maintainer is now
Ben, but that issue aside where did you get your 2.4.3 sources from that you are
trying to build?

  http://www.fsmlabs.com/linuxppcbk.html is the location you want to pull stuff
from.

  Well suggestion one is DON'T GIVE US A WORD DOCUMENT! Plain text please, then
we can actually read what's wrong.

  Best to post to linuxppc-dev@lists.linuxppc.org. That's one of the lists that
the PPC Linux watches.
 
Regards,

Tom
