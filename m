	There is no difference between advocating something and advocating 
advocating something. So if you ask how they have any business telling you 
what to advocate, you ask how they have any business engaging in any advocacy 
at all.

	So what's your position? Do you believe that only you have the right to 
advocate?

>That doesn't sound like free speech nor free thought to me.

	So when someone says something you don't agree with, that's not free speech? 
If someone expresses a thought you don't agree with, that's not free thought? 
Nobody is trying to compel you to do anything, they're just advocating what 
they believe in and explaining the reasons why.
