Thanks for all clarifications. I knew I was absolutely incompetent in all
legal issues, I even confused "copyright" with "trademark"!:-) But that's
interesting information, that trademarks can be registered only in a
specific area. So, anybody could produce, say, toilet paper and call it,
for example, "Microsoft"?:-) Or is this a globally registered trademark?
No. I don't really want to know the answer.

Anyway, I'll keep the ad:-)

Thanks
Guennadi
