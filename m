It's some idiot's "anti-porn" mail trap.

About a year ago, the aic7xxx (Adaptec SCSI driver) couldn't
be referenced without anti-porno junk dropping it on the floor.

IT idiots think that porn file-names have Xes in them. Once
they find out that they have ".jpg" in them, no more pictures
for anybody!
