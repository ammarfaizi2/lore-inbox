Usually you only get arrested when you travel to the
country in question (eg. Dmitry Skylarov or people
criticising the chinese government), but sometimes a
country manages to get somebody extradited for things
which are put on a website (eg. Germany convicted an
Australian for putting neo-nazi stuff on his website).

Both the laws themselves and the legal precedents are
extremely unpredictable, the most sensible thing seems
to be to just not publish things to the country where
they are outlawed by putting some access control in
front of the goodies ;)

Rik
