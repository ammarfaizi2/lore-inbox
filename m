It's not $$$ I'm concerned about. It's mass. I don't want to carry
around a pile of batteries. I like to travel light, whether when
flying or spending a day at a conference. Being able to walk around
all day with your laptop on your shoulder, but not getting sore, is
*really* nice. It gives you more flexibility. No need to run back to
the hotel after the last session to drop of the ball-and-chain and
then run to the restaurant where people are meeting up.

And when flying, I just travel with my super lightweight laptop bag
and a backpack. I can stuff a week's worth of clothes in there, and
it's still not that heavy. But I don't have room for a pile of extra
batteries, nor do I want to add to the burden on my shoulders. I don't
want to carry an extra bag, because I'd have to check in it, which
would mean:
- I have to wait to pick up my luggage (*if* it arrives at all),
  rather than walking out and feeling smug as I pass all the lusers
  waiting for their luggage
- I have to deal with the creative ways in which animals^Wluggage
  handlers can damage or destroy anything
- I have to find a trolley to help carry all the crap I'm carrying
- I have to obtain coins to pay for the trolley, if I'm unlucky enough
  to be stuck at an airport where the bastards are so cheap as to
  charge you money for the damn trolley. I'm sure they've already
  gotten their pound of my flesh via the airport tax/surcharge/
  improvement fee/mandatory gouge/handrail polishing donation/
  or whatever.
