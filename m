What is this official fix? I've only seen unofficial ones (like the one in
your ac7, or was it ac6). What are the implications of the fix
(compabilitywise and speedwise)?

I looked on via's homepage but could not find anything about this fix.
I've very interested since I have a new mobo unopened in a box that I can
still return and choose something with another chipset.
