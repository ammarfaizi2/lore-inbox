Yes, but with a significant difference: 
If somebody breaks MS's stuff, MS will probably try to sue him, but the 
person gets more popular.
If somebody breaks GPL, there may be nobody to sue him, but it can easily
make him a persona non grata in all kinds of free software and open 
source groups. Or, equivalently, if some corporation breaks GPL, this
may cause some very bad PR.
