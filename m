  _SORRY: Forgot to attach the file in the previous mail...

Summary_

    Can't get linux kernel 2.5.23 to compile with success using config
    options in the attached file "config-2.5.23"

_Full description_

    When trying to compile the kernel using config options in
    "config-2.5.13", I get the following erros during a "make bzImage":
