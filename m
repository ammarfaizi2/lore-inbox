interesting.. what do you make of:

	http://download.qlogic.com/sf/10215/fullimage_1.5.1.04.zip

which is the firmware that runs on QLogic SANBox2 2Gbit fibre-channel
switches (Cyrix MediaGX iirc). Looking at strings it includes
software such as glib (LGPL), Linux and GRUB.

QLogic did not answer my request for source to the (L)GPL 
parts of the firmware when i asked them.
