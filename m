kbuild-2.5 - defkeymap files (acorn, character devices, tc)

Here we have several files that were created by loadkeys.

You will need this patch in generic for kbuild-2.5.
You will need most other kbuild-2.5 patches, too!

The mailing list rejected this patch twice, I think it's due
to filter rules paranoia.

This patch is available from
