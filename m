Having fill specs doesn't buy much, the amount of work required to get
a high-performance workable driver is enormous.  I suspect any open
effort along these lines would take so long at to be uninteresting.

I'd much rather have ATI help work with the community in finding a
solution to opening up their drivers (in whole or in part).  The same
applies to nvidia of course, but much I'm much less optimistic there
(which is a shame, because both vendors could gain a lot by working
with the community rather than what feels like against it at times).
