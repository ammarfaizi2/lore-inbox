Yes, I recognise it's his right.  But what bothers me is that he says "I
want users to say they want it" and when user say they want it hey says
"It's a vendor thing, no users want it."

Linus, if you say you're going to listen, please try and listen.  This is
annoying and dissatisfying to all of us when you say you'll listen and you
blatantly ignore people.  Your tree is your tree, for now it's going to be
patching our own kernel, and then possibly moving to another vendor who
listens to their users.
