Subject: SMC2632W doesn't work with 2.5.49

I hope someone can give me some advice/hints/a clue because I cannot seem 
to get my SMC2632W running with 2.5.4[79] even though it works fine with 
2.4.1[89].  I've read the Wireless HOWTO, I believe I have the right 
utils, and I updated with Rusty's module init tools patches (0.7).

My laptop is a Compaq Presario 12XL325 with a a PIII-650, with RedHat 8.0.  
Once I changed the PCMCIA options to bind my card to orinoco_cs instead of 
wvlan_cs the stock system loads everything with no trouble.  2.5.49-bk 
doesn't initialize service automatically because of the known module 
loading breakage.  Loading pcmcia_core, yenta_socket, ds, and orinoco_cs 
by hand gives the following output in /var/log/messages:

I've also been unable to figure out the message about pci=usepirqmask.  
I've tried specifying it on the command line, as an option when loading 
the module and in modules.conf.  Each time I get the same message.


2.5.47 was the last 2.5 version before the module breakage.  When I 
configure that one, I get the following in /var/log/messages:
