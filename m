OK, as entertaining as it has been (though I would've preferred
more posts from Al Viro : he has a great way with words :) can
we all agree that BK/GPL/OSL issues should go somewhere else?

Like maybe an advocacy list instead of a development list?

I've seen the following debated endlessly (with the rhetoric turned
way up these past few weeks) :

- RMS is a cheat trying to steal copyrights from everyone
- RMS is a saviour trying to save the world
- The GPL is a virus that is not legally enforcable and tries
  to promote RMS's political agenda
- The GPL is the only thing keeping Linux free
- BK is spawned from the same pits of hell that Saddam Hussein
  came from (south park is a wonderful learning tool)
- BK is a great piece of software that solves all of our
  problems and allows Larry to make a (legal) living

Can we just agree that the Linus' acts are answer enough?
- The GPL isn't perfect, thus the restrictions in the kernel
  source (specific versions of the GPL only)
- BK isn't perfect, but it is free and solves a lot of problems
  in developing the Linux kernel.  Advocating a program and using
  a program aren't the same thing after all!
- RMS is fighting the good fight, even if he is a bit more extreme
  than many of us would prefer.  Better Gnu/Linux than MS/Linux!

Stop the trolling!  Make code not war!
