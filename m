You might want to reread the underlined sentence. I have no doubts
that there have been better, faster and easier to use machines long
before the PC platform and Microsoft software.

I actually owned an Acorn BBC a long time ago and it was a sweet
little box. Just like the machine after it (which I didn't buy because
I was already hooked on Amiga by then). But how many boxes did they
sell? Did they achieve the "computer as a commodity" goal?

And I didn't write at all that Microsoft gave you that computer. I said
"they made it possible". Most surely you got your computer from Dell, HP,
IBM or that computer store around the corner.
