Linus issued 2.5.29 so I'm sending a new status report.  

- An archive of the 2.5.28 page has been created

- items previously marked as closed were deleted

- items previously marked as proposed fix are now closed

- The IDE Problem has been marked as proposed fix based on email from 
Marcin Dalecki and Linus

- as always, feedback is desired, flamage to /dev/null

- the web page can be found at
