4 words.. mail server virus scanner.

btw, does anyone know of (and please reply off-list as this is way OT)
any virus scanners for unix-type MTAs that keep an updated virii db
on-server via automatic remote updates from virus centers like symantec
(or anywhere else that would have an updated list of virii to plug into
the local db)?
