See, the open source (or free source) people are _not_ interested in
marketing. They're addicted towards technical evolution. By locking new
technologies (like BK) against free use, you slow down evolution of
other "products" (it's a word from hell; I'd rather only talk about
programs). Well, away from companies and money, what do you think? Would
technical evolution get faster if your "idea" is eg. only one year
protected? ...if official standards (think C99) and any other
books/texts/media would belong to public domain after two years?

I think this would fasten evolution in sizes of _magnitudes_! And I
consider this a good thing (over giving companies the possibility to
rest some time because they earn money with licenses and patents).
Instead that, I'd like to express that there's no time to spend on
earning money from what _had been done_ but better spending any time on
doing further development (and leaving old things off).

I think there's everything alright. Abroad that, why not simply let
Pavel do whatever he likes to do at his spare time?

You see this as stealing. I think of further enhancing what's currently
available! Don't rest on what had been done, proceed with evolution!

That's what the README and the THANKS file is for. I like reading them a
lot. This is, because I have some respect to people starting new ideas.
=2E..and I've got some respect for those who coded it. That's what the
AUTHORS file is in place:)

They better start developing again.

Yes, I fear that.

Why not simply face the _real_ problem? It's like "Is somebody allowed
to exclusively earn money from some idea/music/software/... for longer
than, say, half a year or a year or the like?"

My answer: No. If we socially accept these money-making machines, we
accept slowing down the creation of new ideas/music/software/..., just
because we give a lot time to their respective creators to wait for
money flowing in.

Companies will win as long as lawa are like they are just right now (or
as long as current direction is kept). Consider the opposite: consider
peoples all over the world to think that it would be better to only
protect I/M/S/... for half a year; after this time, everything is public
domain. (Of course, laws had to be changed for this.)

I think this would be a better world's vision than today's view out of
my window...
