Subject: UML on s390 (31Bit)

Hi,

currently I'm porting UML to s390 31-bit.
A first 2.6.11 UML system already is running in UML-SKAS0 mode,
which normally should run on an unpatched host (no skas3-patch).

To make UML build and run on s390, I needed to do these two little
changes (the patches are copy and paste. I hope that doesn't hurt,
since they are very small):

1) UML includes some of the subarch's (s390) headers. I had to
    change one of them with the following one-liner, to make this
    compile. AFAICS, this change doesn't break compilation of s390
    itself.

2) UML needs to intercept syscalls via ptrace to invalidate the syscall,
    read syscall's parameters and write the result with the result of
    UML's syscall processing. Also, UML needs to make sure, that the host
    does no syscall restart processing. On i386 for example, this can be
    done by writing -1 to orig_eax on the 2nd syscall interception
    (orig_eax is the syscall number, which after the interception is used
    as a "interrupt was a syscall" flag only.
    Unfortunately, s390 holds syscall number and syscall result in gpr2 and
    its "interrupt was a syscall" flag (trap) is unreachable via ptrace.
    So I changed the host to set trap to -1, if the syscall number is written
    to a negative value on the first syscall interception.
    I hope, this adds what UML needs without changing ptrace visibly to other
    ptrace users.
    (This isn't tested on a 2.6 host yet, because my host still is a 2.4.21 SuSE.
    But I've adapted this change to 2.4 and tested, it works.)

It would be very helpful for me, if these changes could go into s390 mainline.
If there is something wrong with them, please help me find a better solution.
