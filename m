I'm sitting here doing an install of NT4 on a box with a 10 gig

drive containing three partitions (two W2K and one ext2). The nice NT4
install asked me nicely which partition I wanted to install on:
NTFS      4GB
Unknown 1 GB (ext2)
NTFS      5GB

This doesn't look like "default to fry everything" to me. It's nicer if
we stick to the facts...
