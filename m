My name is Mr Wu kwon from Korea and I would like 
you to guide me through the most viable 
investment opportunities in your Country. 
Alternatively, I can invest in your line of 
business if you are interested and if your line 
of business is viable.

I am one of the defectors from the north and I am 
currently residing in South Korea. I have been in 
this Country for sometime now. Before defecting 
from the North, I was into currency exchange
business and I was always travelling to other 
parts of Asia and Europe and during that period, 
I was able to move out my funds and deposit
it in a bank in EUROPE.

I want to invest this funds in your Country with 
your help and advice because we are being treated 
as foreigners here. A lot of defectors now go on 
to Canada or the United States and some parts of 
Europe to live.

For more details, please see the following 
websites;

news/1181380/posts

I want you to send me a complete breakdown of the 
investment opportunities in your Country and also 
let me know What exactly I need to do to enable 
you invest the funds for me in your Country.

If interested, you will have to provide an 
account for receiving the investment funds. I 
will then come over to your Country after you
receive the funds and work out the investment 
plans with you.

After I hear from you and find out the best 
investment business you can introduce to me, I 
will tell you how much is involved.

I will expect your response together with your 
contact details, preferably your private 
telephone number so that I can discuss further 
and additional details.

Reply through my private email address.
Regards and God Bless
Mr Wu kwon
