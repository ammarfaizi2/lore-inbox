I think this is based on the 1990 POSIX spec. The things the new suite is
starting with have been added since then, up to and including the 2001 spec.

It is public domain I believe, so I would like to merge that in at some point,
but I would want to review the test cases individually to make sure they still
apply to the latest spec, etc. A lot of the work is just checking things in the
latest specification and adding/updating references in the code.
