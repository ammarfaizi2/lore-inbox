Hi,
the company that i work for is going to buy a pair of Panda
Gatedefenders 8200 that are linux based. To start, they never told us or
mention on their site (as far as i searched) the use of linux in their
product. Another thing is that they don't give us root access nor any
other type of local access to the box besides the http page the
appliance have to be managed. The thing is that i asked for the kernel
source they use in the system and they said they can't give it since
they have some proprietary code in it, as far as i understood.
I really don't know the proper way to report a GPL violation so i
thought this was a good place.
If there is any question please feel free to ask, i'll do my best to
answer it.
