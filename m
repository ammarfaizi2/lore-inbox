Hi Marcelo,

I sent you this patch a week ago, but it appears to have reached
/dev/null.

In the latest release of the RTOS QNX 6.1.0 the boot-sector
signature we used to check for a valid QNX4 partition was removed;
it seems they have extended their partition boot loader and needed
the few extra bytes occupied by the signature.
Other than that, the file-system is unchanged.

The patch below replaces the check for the boot-sector signature by
a check for another signature in the superblock (the (invariant) name
of the root dir) - that one is sure to stay (until they really change
the disk structure).

The TODO and BUGS files are rather obsolete and can be removed.

I've also updated Configure.help to reflect the fact that QNX6 uses
the same file-system as QNX4 and have removed the EXPERIMENTAL tag
from the read-only part (apart from a complete system hang in 2.4.8/9
there have been no severe bugs reported since 2.4.0, so I think that
move is appropriate now).

Cheers
  Anders (maintainer)

-    - Writing is still unsupported (it may compile, but it certainly won't

-    - qnx4_checkroot (inode.c), currently there's a look for the '/' in
-      the root direntry, if so then the current mounted device is a qnx4
-      partition. This has to be rewritten with a look for 'QNX4' in the
-      bootblock, it seems to me the savest way to ensure that the mounted
-      device is in fact a QNX4 partition.
-      Done 20-06-1998, Frank. But some disks (like QNX install floppies)
-      don't have 'QNX4' in their bootblock.

-    - Bitmap functions. To find out the free space, largest free block, etc.
