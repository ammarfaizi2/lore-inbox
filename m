Hi Yitzchak,

No problem.  Here's a link to read to know how to reply to this list.
This isn't quite the same as most mailing lists because of the volume of
mail one receives here. (I get around 300 a day). So here's part of the
FAQ in sending to this list.  One thing to notice is that you shouldn't
"top-post".  That is, to reply above what you are replying to and leave
the entire message intact. ;-)
