Subject: is there a way to export a fat32 file system using nfs?

Hi.  I seem to remember  that at one time in the 2.2 series I was able
to to export fat32 file systems using nfs, but now it doesn't work
anymore.

If I remember correctly, I get "get: operation not permitted" when
trying to export the directory in question.

I am using 2.4.5.

Any assistance would be appreciated.
