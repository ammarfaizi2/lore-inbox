I have already been constructive and wrote some lines that showed up
how a driver tree could look like. Unfortunately nobody did take this
proposal as a base for a future discussion.

Being constuctive does not make sense if it is obvious that other
people don't listen.

The discussion now looks better than a day ago... If I have read my mail
from the weekend, I may try to draw an image as it may be that people in this 
list do not like text.

>(with another subject, BTW since most people won't read it else).

I already did (see above).

I would be happy to hear about concepts. Currently it looks as if at least
some people like to keep everything as it is. This is not a conceptional OS but 
a grown structure. If you like to keep code maintainable for a long time,
you need to clean up the thicket from time to time. This seems to be something 
that is not done frequent enough with most free software. I know how to
clean up software and I do it from time to time with my software.
Look e.g. at star, it started in 1982 and the fully usable version is now 17 
years old. It was still possible to add something like POSIX.1-2001 compliance 
within ~ 2 weeks. Try to do this with GNU tar...

Well, I try to match with the crowd ;-)
