Actually, preemption seems to be disabled when entering cpu_idle(), but
it must be enabled around the call to schedule(). That explains the
"scheduling while atomic" storm we saw when enabling CONFIG_PREEMPT
anyway.

CONFIG_PREEMPT support is one of the things still missing, btw. I'll
implement that next, now that genirq seems to be working.

I'll do that. Thanks.
