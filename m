... well, that's what it'd be called if i were rusty.

my paper from linux.conf.au is available from

ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/willy/lca/

in both TeX and pdf formats.  I'd like to turn this into documentation
that's more suitable for linux/Documentation, but that's for a later time.
I'll probably not check my email for the next week, so don't expect an
immediate response.
