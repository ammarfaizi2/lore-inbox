It would take a *LOT* longer than a couple of hours. The HTML is automagically generated by a licensed program and there are several thousand HTML files (nearly
every link is a different file). Every time a new kernel release came out, I'd have to do it all over again. It already takes several hours to generate the
documentation to begin with (I'm using a UP PIII 800, but even on my Tyan it takes hours).

If you want it better (and this goes for the others that have asked similar questions), then be my guest and jazz it up on your own mirror (but I hope you have
nothing better to do with your time :)
