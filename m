You are not reading the article carefully enough.

With Linux, everyone is free to make their own changes which suit their 
particular setup, recompile the kernel, and run their own linux kernel on 
their site / server / workstation / whatever.

Microsoft specifically forbids this in their license!

It is a "look but don't touch" license which is as far away from the ideas 
of the GPL as you can possibly get.

Even submitting them a patch is technically violating their license as a 
patch implies that you have modified their code already, which is forbidden!

The only change from before that I can see is that Microsoft is going to 
make even more money now, because they will collect the money from ~1000 
instead of ~10 people. No other news there.
