Hello,

As promised, SF.net restarted CVS support over the week-end. I was
able to update the CVS tree for libpfm to include all the releases
since 3.2-060405. It now includes up to 3.2-060512 + the latest
updates.

I have also added pfmon to the CVS repository. The tree currently
includes release 3.2-060426.

The infomation to use to checkout:

	pfmon modulename: pfmon
	libpfm modulename: libpfm

Careful, as the CVS site name has changed as part of SF.net upgrade.
Make sure you follow the instructions at:
	http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=144822

Thanks for your patience.

Enjoy,

-- 
-Stephane
