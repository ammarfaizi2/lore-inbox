This case is easily solved without any new mechanism. Simply assign a
quota of 1GB to each user while providing physical disk space only for
the expected filling + free space margin. Handle additional space
requirements as you described above.

What Amid tries to solve is obviously a different "scenario": how to put
more files on the disks than fit in the physically available space.

He tries to do that by
   - squeezing in more data by compressing other data
   - deleting files
   - backing up files

And he provides a mechanism how a user can buy more space by marking
other files as "shrink/delete/back up at filesystems discretion". So in
effect he says: buy more space by marking files as "not needed, may be
removed (deleted or moved to some unreachable place) at any time". Then
I would rather opt to "clean up" my files myself whenever I need more
space within my quota.

(The compression case is actually not working out, since it will only
get back as much space as the compression achieves. So the elastic quota
may only be expanded by the space saved when the file is compressed. To
find out this ratio, you have to compress the file. But then you can as
well have your filesystem transparently compress the file.)
