Hello all...

I've recently bought a new mobo, the Abit KG7-Raid, and I've run into some trouble trying to get the agpgart to work correctly. Everytime I load it 
on kernel 2.4.9 (nonpatched, straigt from the tarball) I get messages like 'Unsupported chipset; try try_unsupported' (or smthing, not entirely
sure about the msg anymore since I'm not on that PC right now). I've tried what it advices, but still it keeps on giving that error.

Anyone got a clue?

Thanks,

Devil
