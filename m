Hi

 Could someone enlight me about the support of this chipset in 2.4 series?
 I've read some posts about it, dating from not long time ago and since im 
planning to buy an asus l5800c with that chipset i would like to know if 
linux is going to work in it or not.
 I have seen other problems with sis (such as graphics not (quite) working in 
linux) and i think im going to buy other laptop that doesnt use sis.... 
(toshiba maybe...)

Thanks for your kindness,

 João Seabra
