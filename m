No, you are missing the point.

Clause 3 says "...provided that you also do one of the following"

And 3(a) is done, as the source is included with the binary.

Further, all of the source is available anyhow in various open source
projects.

Besides, 3(b) says one must accompany the binary with a written offer.
How do you know that is not being done? It says nothing about source
available on a website.  But 3(b) is not a requirement since 3(a) is
met.
