Subject: Newbie: HDD light always stays on after installing my compiled Kernel

Hi. I hope this is the proper mailing list to post my question since this 
is my first time posting to a Kernel mailing list. Also, I am new in 
compiling Kernels (scary stuff).

I am having an odd problem after compiling Kernel 2.4.19 for my Red Hat
Linux 7.2 system. I was able to get everything to work, but it seems like
my HDD light is always on even when the HDDs are idled (not doing
anything). I do not have this problem with the regular Kernels from Red
Hat (2.4.2 and 2.4.9) and in Windows XP Professional SP1 (dual boot).

You can read the full details (including logs) on:

Did I miss something in Kernel configuration? Thank you in advance. :)

Best regards,
Phillip
