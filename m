Hi,
i'm (trying to be) a beginner kernel developer, and i would to know if 
there are some exercises/challenges where i must practice what i've 
readed, if the most experienced developers already done it. I learn 
better when I practice something. Anyone knows it ?

Here in this list, people talk about everything and is a bit complicated 
for a beginner to get something. I would read about something and after 
practice that, like on math books.  I think it's not so difficult for an 
advanced kernel coder to do it, and is a great way to help people to 
start. So please, can anyone make those questions and put it public ?

See, i'm not wanting tutorials, tips, manuals, docs, etc. I just want to 
practice, just beginner questions and exercises, separated by topics and 
levels, something challenging me, but not get a TODO list of many 
difficult patchs.

I don't know if that list is the right place to ask about that, but by 
the description of this list, maybe. Anyway, if is not the right place, 
sorry for all.

Regards,
Luiz Felipe
