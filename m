@Alan, CJ, Pierre, Ori

Its a shame, after 5 years of Linux, my first post 
to the Kernel Mailinglist outs me as a dummy!!

Sorry thousand times for wasting your time!

Obviously it was the wrong processor type which 
caused the freeze.

But it has one really NIG advantage! I talked to 
the real Alan Cox Yippy.

I have to make some phonecallz...

thx and cu
