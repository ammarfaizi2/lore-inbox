Nor have I, but I think you guys working on it will get it
cleaned up eventually.  What bugs me is people trying to pretend
that it isn't important to fix, or that spending money to get
newer hardware is acceptable solution.

Yes, it is cheap.  It isn't always an acceptable workaround
though, so I'm glad you guys are working on it - even if we have
to wait a bit.

I have faith in the system.  ;o)
