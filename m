This header tells you that the patch was generated by running:

diff -u linux/include/linux/pci_ids.h.netmos linux/include/linux/pci_ids.h

The original file is marked with --- and the new file is marked with +++

This is used to seperate parts of the patch file.  What it means exactly is
that the file position in the original file was at line 1664 and extended
for 8 lines, and in the new file its at line 1664 and extends for 12 lines.

Same as above.  Lines 6 lines starting at 2831 in original file, and 15
lines starting at 2839 in the new file.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,
