We all know that and thats what he does best: to develop kernels, not
maintain, or do you use a development kernel on your mission critical
servers?

2.4 is not supposed to be bugfixes and new drivers/whatever that don't
touch common stable code, isn't? Thats maintainance. 2.5 is about
development.
