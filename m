The basic issue of how well you can live by performing certain work
is exactly the same. And in both cases, the incorrect assumptions
are to underestimate the potential for changes, and to look for a
transition that is risk-free. (*)

(*) Paranoiac's Categorical Imperative: if there's a risk for
    anybody, there could also be a risk for me, so I must oppose
    it.

If we sent our kids to school, they could learn to do our jobs.
That would be suicidal... ;-)

Besides, nobody said that developing free software requires you
to decline being compensated for your work.
