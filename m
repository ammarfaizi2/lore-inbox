Please edit your CC list for crap.  Linus's email is wrong.  The CC list 
is so huge that my reply to you is being held by the evlog list manager. 
  And my reply is being "held for moderation" in the cgl-discuss list.

And you came very close to setting off spamassassin's spam trigger ;-)

Good email etiquette goes a long way, around here...
