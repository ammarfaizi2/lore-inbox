Maybe; however, there's a big difference between gtk+ and qt- gtk 1.2
take about 5 minutes to compile. The last time I compiled qt, it took
about 3 hours on my duron 800.

GTK is a lot smaller of a platform, and a lot of users prefer to use it
instead. If someone is willing to write (and maintain) a GTK+
(especially if it's ait gtk+-1.2.x. gtk-2.0 is getting a bit more
bloaty) version of it, I know quite a few people who would gladly use it
instead of the QT.

If people are willing to support both a QT and a GTK version, then there
should be no real problems.
