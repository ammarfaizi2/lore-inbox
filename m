Yeah, well I already did work for the SPOOKS of the cloak-n-dagger world
the help deal with world terrorism and have yet to be paid!  I do
electronic wire transfers in two stages now.

One to a front bank that relays to the second real one.
Pissy people who try to get their money back by rewinding the tapes!

I guess I will spend the profits on sharks, instead of maybe funding
projects.  See there are people who will do the right thing.  The part
people do not get is, they only do it when it benefits them also.
