Greetings;

I've not received an great amount of messages to this list since I got 
back from a weeklong trip (2690 miles total) to Nebraska for a 
wedding (no not mine).

I found my mailbox at verizon overflowing when I got back and I'm 
wondering if I got unsubbed because of bounced emails.

If so, can someone fix it?
