I've searched the kernel Documentation directory (linux 2.4.x) and I can't 
find anything about which IDE - ata100 pci cards are supported.  I also
looked in the Doc directory for my 2.2.12 kernel with no luck either.

I've purchased the only one I could find at the comp-usa near me (Maxtor)
and their web site doesn't even tell me what chipset it uses.

I wanted to verify that it will work before I open it up, or they won't take 
it back for a refund.

Next I searched the linux-kernel archives for maxtor, and saw some things
about disks, but nothing about the controller, so I guess it has never
come up???

Where am I supposed to find this kind of information?

thanks,
-chuck
