Can you check the message source or save the mail to your HD and see if 
it's mangled there as well?  The lines that cause the problems have an 
extra space at the end of them.   But that's how the were in my original 
patch file.  I forwarded that message to myself and checked that actual 
file on my mail server and the patch was 100% like the original.  It 
_is_ a display bug.

I'll install samba onto that test machine so I can make the patches into 
attachments.  (Yes, this is a windows box.  Please forgive me!   Once I 
get a new monitor for my SMP linux box it'll become my web/email machine).
