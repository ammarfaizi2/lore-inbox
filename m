Yes, and I apologize for that intemperate post from me. Quite
unnecessary and utterly unhelpful. It just irks me to be told "you're
late to the party" when we were told "the party can happen without
you". Nothing more than that. Its great to see that people *do* care
about this stuff. Sorry for the noise.
