I think you missed how linux development works. Things fork all the
time. The unsuccessful forks die. The successful ones join the "main
line" again. Darwinism at work.

You're free to put your coding where your mouth is and design and
implement a stable API. If it's a success.. it'll get there. If it's
not.. no harm done to the rest.

I think I don't get how you come from "stable API" to "aid scalability"
in the light that the current non-API doesn't seem to prevent
scalability to the size linux development is today.

again you skip a step. I see how a "large community" leads to "needs a
visible API". The leap to "need stable API" I don't see in practice.

I hope you're also willing to put your effort where your words are,
otherwise you are trolling to a large degree.
