Does anybody have a brown paper bag I could borrow ?

It appears Robert and I cleaned up stuff a bit too much
and procps lost it's VERSION string, so -V doesn't work
in the tarball I released earlier today.

Also, it appears the release has awoken some long sleeping
patches, which I'll read and (if they work) integrate into
procps.

Expect patches and maybe even a fixed 2.0.8 tarball soon...

If you have any procps bugs or patches, please mail the procps team:

	procps-list@redhat.com

regards,

Rik
