I told you multiple times that I am doing bug fixes and maintenance on
1,000s of lines of contributed code. Is that not a valid reason to
have an account? So only people writing new code can have accounts? I
guess you will have to disable half of all the accounts on fd.o to
enforce that policy.

You censored the article.

What the Project Leader does
      Review and approve the request for an account & access to your project.

I believe I am a member of five projects on fd.o and you are not the
Project Leader of any of them. I would like to see the request from
the Project Leaders for my account removal.
