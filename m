Hi,

Please CC me on replies, as I'm not subscribed to the list.

Since moving from 2.4 to 2.6 on my laptop, I've had a few problems with
mouse and keyboard input.

1. Keyboard - dropped key presses
On 2.6, it seems that every now and then while typing a few key presses
get dropped. I noticed this from 2.6.0-testX and 2.6.1, but I'm using
2.6.2-pre2-bk2 right now and I haven't noticed that happening for the
last few days. Usually it would happen several times a day, so perhaps
that has been fixed.

I do see this in /var/log/messages though:
  atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0x7a on
isa0060/serio0).
  atkbd.c: This is an XFree86 bug. It shouldn't access hardware
directly.

2. Mouse - pointer precision
This might sound a little weird, but since moving to 2.6, my mouse
pointer's smallest movement in X is 2-pixels. It's easy to see when I
drag a window around in blackbox, the window co-ordinates stick to
either odd or even numbers, depending where I started. It doesn't make
any difference whether I use the "nipple" in the middle of the keyboard
or attach a usb mouse.

3. Mouse - double clicks
Ok, another wierd effect here - sometimes when I click on something in
X, the action happens twice. Erm, let me describe by example. E.g. When
I launch an xterm from the blackbox menu sometimes two xterms will
appear; as if I had instantly clicked twice on the menu. This has also
happened a couple of times in evolution when I clicked the "send" button
and two copies of the email got sent. Again, I've tried several
different mice and have the same problem with each in 2.6, and no
problem in 2.4.

4. Mouse button stuck?
This happens very rarely, but it's very annoying when it does.
Occasionally the "mouse wheel up" button will get stuck on. I don't know
if it's actually stuck or not, but any window I mouse over will get
continual "mouse wheel up" events. I've only been able to reset this
with a reboot so far. Maybe a 2.4 problem as well, though I can't
remember clearly (it is a rare occurence).

Please let me know what kind information will be useful in debugging
this, as I haven't got a clue! I'm happy to run tests or try out
patches. Here's some general info:

Laptop Model: Toshiba Libretto L5/080TNLN
CPU: Transmeta Crusoe TM5800
Kernel Version: Any 2.6, Currently 2.6.2-pre2-bk2
Distribution: Debian Sid

Config attached.

Regards,
Kevin Shanahan.
