For support with Red Hat kernels, please contact Red Hat.
The linux-kernel mailing list can only support kernels built
from the sources at http://kernel.org
(e.g. http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.20.tar.bz2 )
If you can reproduce the problem using a kernel.org kernel, please repost your question,
preferably using the format described at http://lxr.linux.no/source/REPORTING-BUGS
And if you can't reproduce the problem with that kernel, you've solved it!

See http://www.kernelnewbies.org/ if you need help with the above.
