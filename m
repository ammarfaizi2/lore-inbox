While you are may be reporting your thoughts accurately, this problem
doesn't seem to be a legal issue.

The GPL explicitly discusses this issue (section 5), and a number of
people have already posted with similar commentary.

Anyways, one thing to keep in mind here is that if copyright law doesn't
allow the GPL's grant of permission to be conditional then copyright
law would not allow other copyright grants to be conditional.

Another way of looking at this is that the GPL is a copyright license --
it represents the terms and conditions under which copyrights are granted,
and it also represents those permissions.
