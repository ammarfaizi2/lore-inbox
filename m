This is a situation, descibed by Douglas Adams in the opening
chapters of "Hitchiker's Guide to Galaxy". You put the vital info
somewhere, and when someone (who has to suffer if he does not see it)
fails to retrieve the info, it gets his own fault. It all was in
the open, so what else is to be desired?

I used to be super irritated by separate lists. Now I'm a member
of linux-usb-devel, uml-devel, sparclinux, and god knows what else.
Yes, they are unavoidable. Still, it is important to keep linux-kernel
at least somewhat informed. IMHO.
