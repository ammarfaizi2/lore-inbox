On a Techology Systems 5500 board, the TI cardbus is reporting
interrupts problems:

-snip-
PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:0c.0 (0004 -> 0006)
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 0000:00:0c.0. Please try using pci=biosirq.
Yenta: CardBus bridge found at 0000:00:0c.0 [0000:0000]

Yenta TI: socket 0000:00:0c.0 probing PCI interrupt failed, trying to fix
Yenta TI: socket 0000:00:0c.0 no PCI interrupts. Fish. Please report.
Yenta: ISA IRQ mask 0x00c0, PCI irq 0
Socket status: 30000010
-snip-

I've tried both CONFIG_PCI_GOANY and CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT, no difference. 
`pci=biosirq' doesn't help either.

The Technology Systems documentation 
<http://www.embeddedx86.com/downloads/Manuals/TS-5500.pdf> suggests 
that the following chances must be made to /etc/pcmcia/config.opts:

Remove:

include port 0x0100-0x04ff, port 0x800-0x8ff
exclude irq 7

Add:

exclude irq 3
exclude irq 4
exclude irq 5

So irq 7 is used, which does work after cardmgr is started twice(!). 
However that does not seem like the right solution -- should Technology 
Systems fix their bios or is it something that can be remedied in the 
kernel? I was hoping to do root-nfs.

Tested with kernel 2.6.6.
