Yes I did read what Linus said, and I did consider that when I wrote this, I
still don't feel that it should stop them if they plan to release it and it
might be quite some time before they have it in what they consider a
releasable state (if a company wants to clean things up before releasing
them, great, but if it's going to be a while, I'm saying that they
should *consider* simply releasing them in a given state)

Please understand that I'm not really condemming anyone or anything, I
saying that I did not see the point in keeping it all closed simply because
the source/docs are a mess.
I do understand that they may have reason for not wanting to release things
in that state, but I'm not sure it should stop them if at all possible, as
even messy, undocumented code, and bad spec sheets, is better than nothing
at all.

There's something else I was going to add in my original note but failed to.
(warning, painfully obvious paragraph ahead)
I belive that if companies would write drivers and specs from the beginning
with the intention of releasing at least the specs if not the specs and
source, then we'd probably wind up with better products as well as cleaner
code and spec sheets.
Prehaps it's time someone gave the companies a little nudging (possibly with
a penguin beak? :).
