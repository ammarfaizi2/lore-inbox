Jeff, thank you for responding.

OK.  I've compiled test1, and it also oopsed on boot.  (Which is confusing,
since I know for sure I had test4 compiled and running.  I must have changed
something in my system in the interim, but I can't remember what!)  I'm now
compiling 2.2.17, to
see if that works.  If so, I'll try some 2.3.x sources.

I believe so, I used the vmlinux and System.map that were in the source tree
following the build.  They should be correct.

Here is the .config I used to build the test10 that oopsed:

Yes, a Soundblaster AWE64 that has never given me any problems.  I tried
booting
test10 and test1 with that card pulled, and they both still oopsed on boot.
