I am already on the linux-usb-devel mailing list.  The only reason I
decided to do this is the fact that the person that was working on the
ibmcam.c usb driver already had given up on the camera because of the
problem with the compression format.  I figured I would have a go at it
and see if I could petition for documentation on it.  I sent an email to
dmitri on it already, but never received a response; I then took action.
Thanks for replying though.
