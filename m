I'm having a strange problem with an Intel D815EEA2 motherboard
with a 1Ghz PIII and 256MB of RAM.  It takes about 2 minutes to
get through it's BIOS, and even things like hitting F2
to go into BIOS setup take a long time to complete.....

However, when it finally does get into GRUB, it's fast
from there on out.  I assembled the components myself,
so I could have screwed up something, but the HDD, floppy,
and CDROM seem to work fine, and like I said..it runs fine
once it actually starts booting...

Anyone got any ideas?

Thanks,
Ben
