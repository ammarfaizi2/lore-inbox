We have some test machines here at OSDL that have a problem with the ide
cdrom driver hanging when we cat the /proc/ide/hda/identify file. After
30 seconds the console displays: "hda: lost interrupt" which reoccurs
every 30 seconds forever. We noticed it on 2.6.2-rc2-mm1 but It looks
like this has been a problem for a while. Our test machines just changed
their configuration to use make defconfig.  I found that if
CONFIG_IDE_TASKFILE_IO is N then the hang doesn't occur.  Is this a
common problem or are there just certain drives that won't work with
taskfile i/o enabled?  I've included my .config, lspci as attachments.  
The cdrom model is CD-224E.
