Hey! I didn't call anyone stupid. I didn't even call the idea
stupid. I think your terminology is backwards to the way I think and
what seems to be accepted practice (and I notice I'm not alone in
that).

However, "he who writes the code gets to choose", and I'd be a
hypocrite to say otherwise :-) I was just hoping to change your mind.
