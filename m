can you at least provide a list of such structural problems?
In fact, why don't you collect them and mail them out (bi)weekly... that
may already do wonders.
Look at what Adrian is doing with the regressions; although the response
isn't 100% people DO pay attention to it.... so maybe if you post a
"structural problems list" people will actually start working on
things.. (and of course you can help too ;)
