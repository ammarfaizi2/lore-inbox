Firstly, IANAFSN (I am not a Free Software Nazi) but there is this
new GPL decentralized version control program called arch that is small
and fits in well with the Unix way of using other small utils.

When you get weird Bk errors because Larry changes the Open Logging stuff
for the umpteenth time which forces you to upgrade to keep using Bk,
just remember we told you so.
