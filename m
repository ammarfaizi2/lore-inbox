I don't think so.  Richard's goal seems to be to attempt to convince
everyone his ideology is good.  He doesn't appear to be trying to
force anyone to do anything.  If you don't like his free software
concept, you don't have to GPL your code.

Larry, however, is forcing developers off of a BM-hosted project
simply because one of their hobbies is in competition with his
company, and has explicitly rejected granting limited license to such
people for the sole purpose of developing for BM-hosted projects.
Larry also has the potential to significantly influence kernel
development by threatening withdrawal of BM hosting if the kernel
incorporates "competing" features.  Larry hides behind the excuse
that (e.g. subversion) developers would get a feel for BK operation
and implement competing features in subversion, ignoring that those
developers probably understand most of the significant BK features
already.  Then he rants about how nobody would do the work BM is
doing without pay, and carefully avoids connecting that argument to
his rationale for disallowing competing developers use of BK
exclusively for BM-hosted projects.

I'm sick of Larry, and I bet he's sick of me, but this BK mess is bad
mojo.

And so is posting to this flamewar.
