Hi all!

is there anybody to know that if Linux supports this hardware?
like Sun Netra T1 200 (not 105 which has II/i CPU that is currently
supported)

my debian linux install cd set doesn't boot this hw. (2.2.19)

Is it supported in 2.4.13 or later?
is there any woody cd images for sparc/64 ?

thanks
