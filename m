Hi,

My applogoies if you have received multiple copies of this message.

I am looking for a solution/help in porting a freebsd networking application 
written at tcp and ip-level (involves mbuf, socketbuf structures and 
associated routines) to linux platform.  I am not able to trace any good 
source of help on this. I shall appreciate any pointers/help in this regard.

TIA.
Sakib
