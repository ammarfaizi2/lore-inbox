Ben, I think maybe we need to get people excited about your patches,
and build up a user base, before putting them in the mainline kernel.
The volume on the linux-aio list has been pretty light, and the
visibility of the patches has been pretty low.

I know I volunteered to write some doc for your aio, and haven't delivered;
thus I'm contributing to the problem.  Mea culpa.  But there are some
small things that could be done.  A freshmeat.net entry for the project,
for instance.  Shall I create one, or would you rather do it?
A home page for linux-aio would be great, too.
