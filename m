A Closer Look at Our Employees:

Polina, 21.

"…decided to pursue a career of Financial Agent after a summer internship in a small financial firm. Speaking to Kemper Isurance Companies recruiter confirmed my interests and led me to believe that Kemper Isurance Companies would be an ideal cultural and intellectual environment. My particular degree was not directly related to either banking or finance. Nevertheless, I do feel that the wide scope of knowledge that my degree provided me with is highly beneficial to my job.  Kemper Isurance Companies prides itself in its diversity and I can see why. The staff here is multicultural: people come from different countries, backgrounds, and have different interests. There were no tricky finance questions and you didn't have to provide your 5 worst weaknesses. My daily challenge is to perform what is required of me at my utmost ability with minimal amount of mistakes. No work is ever flawless, so the closer we get to perfection on any task, the bigger the victory…"
