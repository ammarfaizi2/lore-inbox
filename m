Throughput on vger.kernel.org does seem incredible.  But lately
SourceForge doesn't seem very bad at all, as it seems they have beefed
up their servers.

I'm only proposing SourceForge as I can set up a list easily there
easily, and I don't know the right people to ask to get it done on
vger.kernel.org :)

Unless anyone objects in the next 10 hours, I'll try to create it, and
let everyone know about it.

thanks,
