The question he was responding to was why Sun hadn't
put out a Linux version of some solaris-only piece of
software.  His answer was that Solaris was Sun's
implementation of Linux.

(I'm going to resort to a sports analogy.  Brace
yourself.  No, I don't know which sport.  Volleyball,
possibly.)

Yeah, it's a borderline foul.  But I still think it
deserves a warning from the referee.

(It's over, you can relax now.)

Point: I really do think somebody official should send
the guy a letter asking him to be careful around the
trademark.

Somebody asked him a question about why there was no
Linux version of a piece of software, and he attacked
the validity of the question by saying Solaris is
Sun's implementation of Linux.  My reading of it is
that he didn't answer the question, instead he implied
very strongly that the question was invalid, and did
so by implying very strongly that Solaris -IS- Linux
hence no need for a seperate Linux version.

Either he's fundamentally confused, or he's
intentionally trying to be confusing.  The first calls
for clarification, the second calls for defending the
infringed trademark.  I'm not sure which of the two
would be "giving him the benefit of the doubt",
neither's particularly flattering.

But that's not actually what he said, is it?

He could have said that, true.  Would have been well
within his rights to say it, and a valid commercial
strategy (although not necessarily a winning one).

But that's not what he said.

You could say the sky is green.  The more interesting
question is, are you the one putting out Wine?

Winehq.com doesn't claim Wine is a windows
implementation, does it?  It calls it an
implementation of the Windows APIs.

Actually, I wouldn't be too suprised if they did. 
They have lawyers on salary just waiting for something
to do.  The question is, are you
big/important/noticeable enough to go after?

By the way, have you read the actual "about Wine" page
from Wine's site?

http://www.winehq.com/about.shtml

Trademark acknowledgement is at the bottom (albiet in
a rather vague way), and the "about Wine" section is
quite clear on what Wine is and what it isn't.

But you're not a corporation, are you?

I'm not advocacying, I raised a question about the
Linux trademark in the venue I thought most
appropriate (don't know of a better one), and I'm
following up on the replies.  I've trimmed the "cc:"
list on several occasions.

It doesn't noticeably seem to be skewing the overall
signal to noise ratio of l-k so far. :)
