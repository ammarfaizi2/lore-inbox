One last word to this email:

- Linux is kind of stable for _normal_ use
- PinkFreud did actually warn us. It is important to
include latest hardware support into the kernel, but we
should always aim to have a stable Linux.

So all guys herein do the best work they can do and I am
impressed everyday, what a great OS Linux was, is and will be.

Have a nice day,

Nico
