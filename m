Hey, it's one of my many duties to release this XIP code to the community.  
In other words, Monta Vista do actually pay me to give that source away.

It's just not up to the cleanliness level I expect of community source even
if customers usually don't care, and I didn't have time to clean it up yet.  
But if you really insist I can give you a raw patch.

I find it quite saddening that a lot of people only care about making up shit 
while the company in question is devoting a lot of money in salary to hire 
kernel developers full time whose work has always been merged to community 
trees so far.
