hi all

I heard that himem slows down systems.

- How much memory can Linux use without highmem enabled? (I've heard it's
  1GB, but Linux found 1,2GB without ...)
- How much is a system slowed down?
- How can this be fixed? I've heard it's a PCI issue (stuff being memory
  mapped above the 2GB limit?)

thanks

roy
