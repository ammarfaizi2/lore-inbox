The solution, as I see it, is to wait for a couple of years until
Larry drops his asking price of $12,000,000 to GPL it, and then ask a
few of the large Linux distros to help raise that money.

Think about it - there will be more competition against BK in a couple
of years time, so GPLing it to get more market share would make
sense.  That way it could compete against, E.G. Subversion, if
Subversion becomes a viable competitor.

Larry - what are your thoughts on this?

John.
