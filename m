That's all handwaving and has no meaning without numbers.  I could care less
if Dell has 99.99% margins on their servers, if they only sell $50M of servers
a quarter that is still less than 10% of their quarterly profit.  

So what are the actual *numbers*?  Your point makes sense if and only if
people sell lots of server.  I spent a few minutes in google: world wide
server sales are $40B at the moment.  The overwhelming majority of that
revenue is small servers.  Let's say that Dell has 20% of that market,
that's $2B/quarter.  Now let's chop off the 1-2 CPU systems.  I'll bet
you long long odds that that is 90% of their revenue in the server space.
Supposing that's right, that's $200M/quarter in big iron sales.  Out of
$8000M/quarter.  

I'd love to see data which is different than this but you'll have a tough
time finding it.  More and more companies are looking at the cost of 
big iron and deciding it doesn't make sense to spend $20K/CPU when they
could be spending $1K/CPU.  Look at Google, try selling them some big
iron.  Look at Wall Street - abandoning big iron as fast as they can.
