I recall some discussions of MAC address changing, etc., and some of the messages referred to a way of changing the name Linux (and thus anything using SIOGETIF or whatever) uses to refer to an interface. I can't remember any specifics, so I can't find anything in archives :( Could someone please point me in the right direction?

By the way, I have 11 binary modules (among them, nvidia's) and my 2.5.7 kernel crashes sometimes. Would you help me debug that? Also, we should rewrite the kernel in C++, convert all 'goto' error handling to C++ Exception handling, localize/internationalize all kernel printk() calls. Half the kernel developers can do that, while the other half switch to a thread-based microkernel architecture. Oh, and it all needs to work nice and smoothly on my 386SX laptop with 4MB RAM, OK?
