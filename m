"such a tradeoff" ?

While this sounds reasonable, I have to point out that
up to now nobody has described exactly WHAT tradeoff
they'd like to make tunable and why...

I'm not against making things tunable, but I would like
to at least see the proponents of tunable things explain
WHAT they want tunable and exactly WHY.

regards,

Rik
