Uhhh nope. You are forgetting the case of the estate of Jacquiline Susanne 
(SP?). There was a developer that created an expert system capable of 
generating stories/novels in the "style of".

The estate claimed copyright infringement, and won. The generated text was 
obviously "derived from", and the developer claimed that just because it
looked like and sounded like, that it was independant and could not infringe.
He lost.

There was no problem with him generating stories for himself, but as soon
as he started distributing what was generated... Deep do-do. If I remember
right, he couldn't even release the program.
