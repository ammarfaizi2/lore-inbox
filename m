Subject: VT82C686A corruption with 2.4.x

I have a Soyo K7VIA motherboard which uses VT82C686A, with an 800mhz Athlon
CPU in it.
So far I've never run a 2.3* or 2.4* kernel on it, I've only done that on my
P3 using a propriatory micron motherboard that uses an intel BX2 chipset.
However, I recently trashed my linux installation (doing things totaly
unrelated to the kernel) and now would be more than happy to assist in
trying to figure out what the heck is causing the filesystem corruption on
VIA chipsets, but so far I've only found bits and peices of information on
it, and have been unable to locate a compiliation of information avalible on
the problem, so I'd know just where to start.
If anyone could point me to a good place to start looking, besides the
thousands of messages containing just bits and peices of information, I
could get to work on some testing.
