Time to move to Cuba?

[Well, I thought that explicit reason for patents is "to promote
research", and it used to be okay to improve upon someone else's
patent. If patents no longer serve that purpose (if you can't improve
upon someone elses work, it is worse than he keeping it secret; and
patents were made so that people would not keep stuff secret), perhaps
its time to ask if they are still constitutional?]
