And nothing wrong with that. It seems an excelent
opportunity to learn lots about every part of the
kernel.

I guess there are two things to do here:

(1) analyse the general idea of what you want to achieve,
    breaking it down in sub-goals which may be achievable

(2) learn about how the kernel works, you may want to go to

	http://kernelnewbies.org/

I won't have time to put in a project as huge and difficult
as upgrading the kernel "live", but I'll be around to try
and teach people about how the kernel works.

Rik
