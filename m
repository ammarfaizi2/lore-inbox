Doesnt a good mail client manage this well. I'm using procmail to filter
certain patterns in lkml subjects into different mailboxes.

I guess this is just way too much work for the moderator ;)
You know how much mail traffic this list produces. Someone, most of the
people here do all the work past their real job, I guess.

diligent people here. What if there is an important topic on this read-only
list and there are people who have some useful information to contribute?
