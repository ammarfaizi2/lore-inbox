Hi Everyone,

I upgraded my Pentium Pro system to Redhat 9, installed a
linux-2.6.0-test3 kernel, and it fails with a double-fault when
init starts.

The code which decides if it is o.k. to use sysenter is broken for
some Pentium Pro cpus ,in particular, this bit of code from
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel.c:

	/* SEP CPUID bug: Pentium Pro reports SEP but doesn't have it */
	if ( c->x86 == 6 && c->x86_model < 3 && c->x86_mask < 3 )
		clear_bit(X86_FEATURE_SEP, c->x86_capability);

On my cpu model=1 and mask=9, it doesn't clear 86_FEATURE_SEP.
This results in a double-fault when init starts.  The double-fault
happens on the sysexit.  The new double-fault handler caught this
nicely, and I was able to debug this with kgdb.

The logic above is exactly what Intel says to do in "IA-32 IntelÂ®
Architecture Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2: Instruction Set
Reference" on page 3-767.  It also says that sysenter was added to the
Pentium II.

I checked the Pentium Pro and Pentium II Specifications Update manuals
hoping to find the details to justify the "mask < 3" portion of the test
above. They both describe sysenter related errata but none which was
fixed in mask 3.

The attached patch avoids using sysenter on all Pentium Pro systems.
