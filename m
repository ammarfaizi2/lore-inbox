Yes. I can do even better.

I met with Darl McBride this afternoon regarding the GrokSmear postings 
(First time I've ever met him) at SCO's
request -- they invited me over and were trying to put out some sort of 
release to correct GrokSmear's attacks.
He gave me the first list, and I am waiting on the second with all the 
details. I don't think he likes Linux much but he said he
supported disclosing the whole thing and he said he wanted "his stuff" 
out of the Linux tree. I am waiting on Chris Sonntag
and Blake to get me the "approved" listing. I will have it probably 
Monday. I'll post it then. Darl gave me the prelimiary
listing but we need to post the final. I'll upload the listing to 
ftp.kernel.org://pub/linux/kernel/people/jmerkey
and everyone can look it over. This would be good since it will give 
folks the ability to
challenge/correct/remove/modify whatever and get SCO off Linux's back.

Darl seemed like a nice enough sort, but he doesn't care much for Linux 
or IBM and he's pretty harsh
on IBM. We argued for 30 minutes about SMP support in Linux and I think 
he will just let this one go since
I pointed out that Novell had disclosed the Unixware SMP stuff at 
Brainshare and he cannot claim
it as trade secrete any longer. He would not budge on RCU, NUMA, JFS, or 
XFS however, and he
also said any IBM employee who contributed SMP code in his opinion may 
have misappropriated it
and he would claim any contribution from any IBM employee in Linux.

I will post to kernel.org the complete listing.

Jeff
