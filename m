	What?! It's really this simple, you use the best tool for the job. Why can't 
we advocate the tools that really do work best. Why do we have to be a 
movement based upon an inflexible ideology? (Or are you just mocking the free 
software movement by spitting your stereotype at it?)

	There would be no hypocrisy whatsoever in using BitKeeper if it was honestly 
believed to be the best tool for the job taking the licensing restrictions 
into account. There would also be no hypocrisy in not using it if it was felt 
that the licensing restrictions were too onerous.
