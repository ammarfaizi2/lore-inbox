Couldn't agree more.  The part you don't seem to want to accept is that 
I don't agree with the merits of the arguments presented.  And my view
is based on real world experience versus the theoretical views of the
people making the arguments.

That doesn't make me right, it just makes quite likely that I'm right
based on past history.  Experience almost always wins over theory.
Not always but so far noone has presenting anything compelling which
suggests the theory beats experience in this case, IMO.
