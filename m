X-Warning: Original message contained 8-bit characters, however during
	   the SMTP transport session the receiving system did not announce
	   capability of receiving 8-bit SMTP (RFC 1651-1653), and as this
	   message does not have MIME headers (RFC 2045-2049) to enable
	   encoding change, we had very little choice.
X-Warning: We ASSUME it is less harmful to add the MIME headers, and
	   convert the text to Quoted-Printable, than not to do so,
	   and to strip the message to 7-bits.. (RFC 1428 Appendix A)
X-Warning: We don't know what character set the user used, thus we had to
	   write these MIME-headers with our local system default value.

My name is Mr. Sherman Spints I am an Artist and a consultant. I live i=
n FRANCE, with my three kids, two cats, one dog and the love of my life=
 i.e. my wife. It is definitely a full house and I have been doing Artw=
orks since I was young, I also have been in the business of precious st=
one for a longtime and earned enough to have my personal GOLD mine. Tha=
t made me had about 22 years experience in the profession. I have a maj=
or in Art in high school and took a few College Art Courses. Most of my=
 works are done in either pencil or airbrush mixed with color pencils, =
which I have recently added to make my work more presentable to world.
I design and create artwork on the computer too. I have been selling my=
 artworks for the past 6 years and have had my work featured on trading=
 cards, prints, dailies, magazines and others. I have sold my artworks,=
 sapphires gold and gold dust in galleries and to private collectors fr=
om all over the world. I am always facing serious difficulties when it =
comes to selling my art works to Americans and British=92s and people i=
n some other countries of the world, they are always offering to pay wi=
th a US MONEY ORDER or CHEQUE and Other Forms of Negotiable Instruments=
, which is difficult to be cashed here in Europe.
I am looking for a representative in the STATE or UK and other countrie=
s of the World who will be working for me as a per time worker and I wi=
ll be willing to pay the person 15% for every transaction, which wouldn=
=92t affect your present state of work. I mean someone who would help m=
e receive payments from my customers in the STATE or UK and Other Count=
ries of the world. I need a good person who is responsible, reliable an=
d trustworthy. Because the cost of coming to the state and getting paym=
ents is very expensive for me and I am working on setting up a branch i=
n the STATE and UK, so for now I need a representative in the United st=
ates and UK who will be handling the payment aspect for me.
These payments are either going to be coming in form of a MONEY ORDER, =
TRAVLLERS CHECKS, PERSONAL CHECK or BUSINESS CHECKS. This payments will=
 be coming from my clients to you and your name and address will be eff=
ected on any of the negotiable instruments my clients are paying you wi=
th ok. So all you need to do is to cash the PAYMENTS, deduct your said =
percentage and send the balance of the money back to us through Western=
 Union Money Transfer or Money Gram to any place I will have to instruc=
t you to do that. But the problem I have is Trust and Honesty, but I ha=
ve my way of getting anyone that gets away with our money, I have conta=
cted the FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS (FBI) branch in Washington an=
d I've been given an assurace to get that person tracked down before th=
e next 48hours.=A0=A0Once you have cashed the payment there, your meant=
 to deduct your15% and send the balance to me via Western Union Money T=
ransfer or Money Gram Money Transfer, all transfer fees should be deduc=
ted from the money. If you are interested, please get back to me as soo=
n as possible. Thanks
Regards,

Mr. Sherman Spints,
