I am now being blocking at the start_kernel and caliberate_delay function of Kernel 2.2.x. Also, everyday, I got hundreds of mail from Linux-kernel list but I cannot enjoy it.

Hi-

As long as you don't mind an x86-leaning view of Linux boot/init,
you could begin by looking over this:  http://home.att.net/~rddunlap/
(or at:  http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Linux-Init-HOWTO.html).

And there's lots of intro material at:  http://kernelnewbies.org/
