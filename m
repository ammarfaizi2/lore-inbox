IMHO, no dubt piracy is what caused the reaction. But it's not a direct
cause. They always wanted things like DRM. The stronger is the control
over your customers, the more money you get from them. Piracy is a very
good excuse, but even without piracy it was only a matter of time. The
distance between who can and who cannot, is contantly increasing. It's
the age we are living :(


Bye.
