Prepared Text of Remarks by Craig Mundie, Microsoft Senior Vice 
President
The Commercial Software Model
The New York University Stern School of Business
May 3, 2001

It has long been said that change is the only constant in the 
technology industry. In the past 20 years the velocity of that change 
has accelerated at a seemingly exponential rate, serving constantly 
as an engine of growth for the global economy.

Yet during the last year, the U.S. economy has hit what could be 
regarded as its most substantial speed bump of the past two decades. 
Illustrated most starkly by the declining valuation of the NASDAQ, 
we've witnessed a notable decline in consumer confidence that has 
people wondering whether we're at a brief respite or whether we've 
reached the end of an economic era.

At Microsoft we believe that the personal information technology 
revolution that began in the early 1980s is far from over. It 
probably has at least two more decades to go. But it's also important 
that we learn from the lessons of the past year and apply them in 
order to make the most of the potential that lies ahead.
One lesson is that we should keep things in context. Every big phase 
of economic expansion has its share of downturns, and new 
technological advances frequently bring with them a share of 
over-exuberance.  The recent and substantial technology investment 
downturn mirrors similar episodes that affected railroads, steel, 
automobiles and radio. In this context, it's not surprising that, as 
early as 1995, Bill Gates wrote in his book The Road Ahead about what 
he called the "Internet gold rush" and predicted both enormous 
long-term advances and substantial short-term setbacks, saying "Gold 
rushes tend to encourage impetuous investments. A few will pay off, 
but when the frenzy is behind us, we will look back incredulously at 
the wreckage of failed ventures and wonder, Who funded these 
companies? What was going on in their minds? Was that just mania at 
work?"

But there is a broader lesson as well companies and investors need 
to focus on business models that can be sustainable over the long 
term in the real world economy. A common trait of many of the 
companies that failed is that they gave away for free or at a loss 
the very thing they produced that was of greatest value in the hope 
that somehow they'd make money selling something else. The Internet, 
for example, was full of sites producing content for free, in the 
hope that somehow they'd generate revenue from sources that never 
materialized, whether it was advertising, subscriptions, or a wing 
and a prayer. As we’ve learned or really re-learned one can't 
build a business or our economic future on that type of flimsy 
foundation.

Contrast this recent experience with the two decades of economic 
success that preceded it. The global economy grew in an unprecedented 
way in no small measure because of a generation of new companies, of 
which Microsoft was fortunate to be one. Many or even most of these 
companies invested heavily in research and development and sold their 
principal products at prices that covered their costs and generated 
profits that they reinvested in further research and development.
This research and development model, in turn, was almost always based 
on the importance of intellectual property rights. Whether 
copyrights, patents or trade secrets, it was this foundation in law 
that made it possible for companies to raise capital, take risks, 
focus on the long term, and create sustainable business models.
Despite the demonstrable success of the computing industry and the 
IP-based economy, and the clear failure of newer firms that gave away 
products for free, it's notable that in the past year there has been 
a broader discussion about whether the ingredients that delivered 
longstanding economic success can continue to do so. In part this 
discussion has focused on whether the personal computer will continue 
to provide a sustainable technological foundation for economic 
growth. And in part this has focused on whether IP protection as we 
have known it whether for music, software, or other products 
should continue to be a fundamental engine of economic growth.
The questions to be raised are twofold: 
Can the personal information technology continue to drive broad 
economic growth?
The answer is "yes."
The computing industry needs to move to a model of multiple computing 
devices that more effectively empower people to unleash the computing 
power of the Internet and move their ideas and their content with 
them from machine to machine.

Should an information-based economy protect the intellectual property 
assets that are driving its growth?
The answer is "yes."
We should examine the progress of the Internet to understand the 
landscape of the software industry today and how intellectual 
property fits into that landscape.

In thinking about the technology foundation we need, it's important 
to recognize that the popular use of the Internet is still less than 
10 years old, and is already moving into its third significant phase.
Phase 1: In the early '90s it was all about static information. The 
nascent World Wide Web was catapulted to the world stage as millions 
of individuals and businesses began to tap the potential of the 
medium.

Phase 2: The late '90s saw the birth of the online transaction and 
the promise of Internet-based business models. Both were about 
connectivity, but now the static distribution of information was 
replaced by business-to-customer or business-to-business transactions.
For the general public, Amazon.com came to personify the Internet
transaction. Revenue models based on advertising sales vs. product sales
came into vogue and Yahoo became the poster child for this model. The
interesting part of this model is the shift of focus away from the
technology IP to content IP as the revenue engine for a company.

Phase 3 is what is being worked on now. It's all about connecting the 
currently separate complex systems of information and transactions 
and bringing that power to the individual in a readily accessible 
format on a variety of devices.

These new technologies will be able to identify the relationships 
between disparate information sources and transactional environments. 
The individual may then cull relevant data and execute the necessary 
transactions to complete a task or make strategic decisions. An 
example of this would be to have a single process for identifying 
physicians covered by your healthcare plan, comparing physical 
locations of clinics to mass transit schedules and routes, scheduling 
the appointment and taking care of the co-pay all at once.  Most 
importantly, this can be done any time, any place and on any device.
There are challenges to the success of Phase 3 becoming a reality.

Business models:
The increasing numbers of failures in the .com space show a flaw in 
many of the existing Internet business models. 

Advertising as the primary revenue stream
Operating under the assumption that market share equals revenue
Free now, pay later

Development models:
A heavy investment in research and development is going to be 
required in order for businesses and individuals to see the benefits 
of phase 3.

People:
The technology industry has to prove its commitment to privacy and 
security in order to encourage user acceptance of the technologies. 
Furthermore, the next phase needs to be presented in a simple and 
compelling fashion so that individuals and businesses may make use of 
them easily.

The paradigm shift that is at the core of phase three is the focus of 
the Microsoft .NET strategy. .NET is a set of Web services that are 
user-centric rather than device-centric. This is a shift in focus 
from individual Web sites or devices to new constellations of 
computers, devices, and services that work together to deliver 
broader, richer solutions. People will have control over how, when 
and what information is delivered to them. Computers, devices and 
services will be able to collaborate directly with each other, and 
businesses will be able to offer their products and services in a way 
that lets customers embed them in their usage of the Web at their 
discretion.

It is important to note that Phase 3 will not come about due to any 
one company's, or even a single group of companies, efforts. 
Innovation investment and a significant community of software 
developers will need to share the excitement for bringing about the 
next generation of the Web. The resulting intellectual property will 
be the foundation of the business model providing the continuing 
opportunity for R&D investment.

The business model I am speaking of for Phase 3 is the Commercial 
Software Model. The taxonomy of this model is built around 5 key 
elements: 

Community: a strong support community of developers
Standards: promote collaboration and interoperability while 
supporting innovation and healthy competition

Business Model: promotes the growth of a profitable business
Investment: level of research and development investment drives 
resources for future innovation

Licensing Model: provides product and source access without 
jeopardizing the intellectual property rights of those who create or 
use the software

Microsoft has fostered the world's largest community of software 
developers for well over a decade. Today, our developer network 
(MSDN) works with a community of 5 million developers. The element of 
the commercial software model for Phase 3 that we need to improve is 
that of our licensing model. Microsoft is expanding its licensing 
model to include our "Shared Source Philosophy."

Shared Source is a balanced approach that allows us to share source 
code with customers and partners while maintaining the intellectual 
property needed to support a strong software business. Shared Source 
represents a framework of business value, technical innovation and 
licensing terms. It covers a spectrum of accessibility that is 
manifest in the variety of source licensing programs offered by 
Microsoft.

The principles of the Shared Source Philosophy are:
Helping customers and partners to be successful through source access 
programs

Building the development community and offering them the tools to 
produce great software

Improving the feedback process in order to create better products for 
Microsoft's customers and partners

Maintaining the integrity of our customers' environments
Increasing educational access in order to get the technology into the 
hands of universities worldwide, and to seed the future of a strong 
technology industry

Protecting software intellectual property based on the firm belief 
that software offers value as the basis of a successful business.
Some examples of Shared Source already being implemented at Microsoft:
Research Source Licensing: For nearly a decade Microsoft Research has 
licensed Windows source code to more than 100 academic institutions 
in 23 countries.

Enterprise Source Licensing Program:  Source code for Windows 2000 
and subsequent releases of Windows is available for licensing at no 
charge to over 1,000 enterprise customers in the United States.  
Today we are announcing a pilot program expanding the ESLP to 12 
additional countries.

ISV Source Licensing: we are developing a program for licensing 
Windows source code to top tier ISVs for development and support 
purposes

OEM Source Licensing: Windows source code has been licensed for years 
to leading OEMs to assist in the development and support of their 
consumer and server products

Windows CE source code access: We are licensing Windows CE source 
code through Platform Builder 3.0 (generally available to all 
developers).  Microsoft will be broadening and adding to the 
community support mechanisms through the Platform Builder Program.  
In the second half of this year we will offer academic site licenses 
for CE source code.

Additionally, we have announced an expanded level of CE source access 
to, (i) our leading silicon vendor partners via the Windows Embedded 
Strategic Silicon Alliance program, and (ii) our leading system 
integrator partners via the Innovation Alliance Program.
Sample code: Over the years Microsoft has made millions of lines of 
source code freely available to developers through resources such as 
SDKs, DDKs, and MSDN.

We have announced that the specifications for the .NET Framework have 
been submitted to the ECMA standards body, enabling others to 
implement and evolve this technology in a platform-independent manner 
so that it is can be rapidly and widely adopted on an industry-wide 
basis.

We emphatically remain committed to a model that protects the 
intellectual property rights in software and ensures the continued 
vitality of an independent software sector that generates revenue and 
will sustain ongoing research and development.

The commercial software model is just one model being utilized in the 
software industry today. It is important to take into account the 
Open Source Software movement as an example of an alternative model.
The phrase "open source software," or OSS, is often used as an 
umbrella term for a collection of product development, distribution 
and licensing practices, many of which have existed individually 
since the early days of computing. There are actually a number of 
different approaches within this community, but the common traits are 
providing people with access to source code and allowing others to 
modify and redistribute that code.

As a result of Microsoft's statement of position today, many people 
will attempt to say that Shared Source is Microsoft's failed attempt 
at being an Open Source Company. This could not be a more incorrect 
statement. Shared Source is not Open Source. We recognize that OSS 
has some benefits, such as the fostering of community, improved 
feedback and augmented debugging. We are always looking for ways to 
improve our products and make our customers more successful, and to 
that end we have incorporated these positive OSS elements in Shared 
Source. But there are significant drawbacks to OSS as well.

The OSS development model leads to a strong possibility of unhealthy 
"forking" of a code base, resulting in the development of multiple 
incompatible versions of programs, weakened interoperability, product 
instability, and hindering businesses’ ability to strategically plan 
for the future. Furthermore, it has inherent security risks and can 
force intellectual property into the public domain.

Some of the most successful OSS technology is licensed under the GNU 
General Public License or GPL. The GPL mandates that any software 
that incorporates source code already licensed under the GPL will 
itself become subject to the GPL. When the resulting software product 
is distributed, its creator must make the entire source code base 
freely available to everyone, at no additional charge. This viral 
aspect of the GPL poses a threat to the intellectual property of any 
organization making use of it. It also fundamentally undermines the 
independent commercial software sector because it effectively makes 
it impossible to distribute software on a basis where recipients pay 
for the product rather than just the cost of distribution.
In this sense, open source software based on the GPL mirrors the .com 
business models that proved the least successful during the past 
year. They ask software developers to give away for free the very 
thing they create that is of greatest value in the hope that somehow 
they'll make money selling something else. In effect, it puts at risk 
the continued vitality of the independent software sector. The 
business model for OSS may well be attractive for software as an 
adjunct to hardware the model of the '60s and '70s or for service 
businesses that do not generate the revenue needed for major 
investments in technology. But as history has shown, while this type 
of model may have a place, it isn’t successful in building a mass 
market and making powerful, easy-to-use software broadly accessible 
to consumers.

In contrast, two decades of experience have shown that an economic 
model that protects intellectual property and a business model that 
recoups research and development costs have shown repeatedly that 
they can create impressive economic benefits and distribute them very 
broadly.

Finally, the fact that we believe strongly in the value of IP 
protection doesn't mean that we discount the importance of 
contributing to and supporting the public domain of knowledge as 
well.  We believe that interaction between the public domain and the 
IP-based sector needs to be based on mutual responsibility and 
respect.

There is an important and longstanding tradition for the public 
domain of knowledge, or "intellectual commons." This is reflected in 
many ways, including federal support for basic research, the 
limitations on IP rights reflected in the law and, more recently, the 
broad practice of contributing technology to public standards groups 
for the continued development of the Internet. We support this and 
want to continue to be a constructive and responsible participant in 
this community, including making contributions to public standards. 
There is an equally important tradition of commercial companies 
having the opportunity to benefit from and apply this public 
knowledge, including by developing commercial products that are 
protected by IP rights. There are many examples of this, including 
the many products that grew from research in the space program and 
the advances in speech recognition technology that followed work done 
at pre-eminent institutions such as Carnegie Mellon.

The GPL asserts that any product derived from source code licensed 
under it becomes subject to the GPL itself. When the resulting 
software product is distributed, the creator must make all of the 
source code available, at no additional charge. This effectively 
makes it impossible for commercial software companies to include 
source code that is licensed under the GPL into their products, since 
by doing so, they are constrained to give away the fruits of their 
labor. As we think about technology, IP rights, and the public sector 
of knowledge, we need an intellectual model that encourages 
interaction, not a model that drives them apart. We believe that a 
shared source model, coupled with continuing contributions to public 
standards, provides a path that is preferable to the open source 
approach founded on the GPL.

Collectively we need to seize the opportunity to make the most of the 
next two decades of potential economic growth. This requires the 
proper combination of continuity and change. It means keeping the 
model of personal information technology but adapting it to the needs 
of the next generation of technology, as we are doing with .NET. It 
means promoting a sharing of knowledge, through source code and 
broader interaction, while respecting the importance of intellectual 
property rights. If we combine these approaches in the right doses, 
there is cause for great optimism about the economic road ahead.
