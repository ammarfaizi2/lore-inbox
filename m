Let me guess - do you have a so called 'winmodem'? Then perhaps you should
read this:

http://www.linmodems.org/

http://www.iac.es/galeria/eddie/linux/modem/winmodem.html

Otherwise, if your modem claims to support v34 then it should be able to
do this by itself. IMHO, the kernel's most important task is to make
serial ports available to communication programs, not to implement
protocols (especially when manufacturers won't give specifications to
people wanting to port them to Linux).

You can also try this:

http://www.56k.com/

I'm not sure if this is the answer to your question.
