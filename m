Just write an SCM file system for the kernel and submit it to Linus.

As to buying me a license, don't bother, and besides who knows what
restrictions would magically appear in the next release Larry did. While
Larry may well be a very friendly and well intentioned devil I'm still
not making pacts with devils 8)

The real fix is to replace BK with something free and better, but thats
*not* a trivial task.
