No. Actually this is _NOT_ my concern. I get payed for the software I
develop no matter if it's free software or propretary stuff, so  from
the monetary point of view I don't have to care.

But this is an ADDITIONAL restriction, which violates the GPL,  which
is the base of the RTL code, or isn't it?

What they say (in public), and what they actually do,  are  different
things.

Define  "if  money  changes  hand".  Let's  say  I  develop  a  smart
controller  software for disk drives, and I give it (maybe for money,
maybe for free, maybe under  GPL  or  not)  to  IBM  and  Maxtor  and
Seagate.  The  disk manufacturers make modifications to the code, and
embed it into their disk drives. Then they sell the  drives  to  Dell
and HP and ... Those sell PCs to many, many vendors, who sell the PCs
to you and men and ...

If that was the case, Victor should have been  able  to  explain  his
intentions to anybody in public. Why did he never do that? But spread
FUD instead?
