Hello,

I took time to read FAQ, and here are few comments.

1 - I understand you don't like RedHat, but instead of ranting, you could
just say that gcc-2.96 from RH updates or RH 7.1 is OK (Alan Cox even
recommends it for compiling recent 2.4 kernels).

16 - also "df -i" shows that there are no used inodes on reiserfs partitions.

36 - Can I use /sbin/badblocks -b <reiserfs-block-size> on existing
reiserfs partition?

39 - a link to "I'm not using RedHat's special release of a buggy compiler"
(http://www.namesys.com/gcc-2.96) is not found.

40 - spelling error "ResierFS".

41 - there is nothing about how to solve it.

Regards,
Nerijus
