Why do many of you not _attach_ patches instead of merging them with the
mail? It's so much cleaner and easier to have a "xxx-yyy.patch" file
attached to the mail which can be saved in an appropriate directory. Also,
the whitespace is always retained that way.

OTOH I don't have very deep knowledge of "diff" and "patch", so maybe I have
missed something here...
