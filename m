Since at least one other person mentioned that your reply was harsh, 
leave it that your intentions were good and you weren't intentionally 
impolitic.

Since the issue is/was in the kernel.org release, the question wasn't 
really out of place. As noted ASUS sound hasn't worked forever, and last 
night I was curious about the claims that it was fixed, and lo... I have 
sound in 2.6.16.1. Of course my webcam stopped working, so now that I 
can play back my meeting notes I can't record the meeting :-( That's not 
a trouble report, I have to look at all my config stuff first.
