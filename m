No it isn't, Alan uses ORBS and you are obviously black listed there
(www.orbs.org).

This one seems to come up every now and then, and always turns into a
flamewar. Now it's Alan's choice so if you want to argue over this,
take it somewhere else please.

Who is maintaining the FAQ? this might be a good idea to add to under
the mailing list section.
