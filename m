I am a non-BK user[1].  And I see this as a total non-issue.

[1] While I am no fan of the license, the real reason I don't use BK is
because I don't think it currently makes sense for developers who are
not also maintainers.  BK really shines when you have people above
(Linus, Andrew) and below (other developers) you.  E.g., it makes sense
for Greg K-H.  Not so much for me or, say, Ingo.  It is the push-pull
relationship where BK shines.  Your comment that you were looking at
improving workloads like Andrew's interests me.
