I realise that it ended up being a more political thread
than a technical thread, but the basic problem still remains :

Does anyone have a way to fix the IBM BIOS so that it will boot
with a different model of miniPCI card installed?  This is the
infamous IBM error 1802 (but I use a T30, not a T40)

I was thinking I'd try hacking the BIOS to put the card I'm using
into the white list, but I thought I'd ask in case someone has a
method to get this fix going that doesn't involve such drastic
measures :)

Thanks
