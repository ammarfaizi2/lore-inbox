Just a general observation. Your arguments are indeed the same. I've
had the same discussion I've had with you with Victor many times.

There is, however, some differences between your situations. I can
rewrite a software that does similar things as yours and sell it
or give it away using whichever license I like. I can't write a similar
software to Victor's and sell it or give it away using whichever
license I like.

There's no need to reply and point out that that's what patents are all
about. I can see that for myself. I'm just pointing out that your
situation is not exactly the same as Victor's.
