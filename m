Please, could one of the native english
speaker enlighten me about 'the the' ...

I know this is absolutely off topic, but
about 30 threads, in the last two months,
on lkml contain this strange construct, 
and I'm worried that I miss something very
important ...

or is this just such a common typo? if so
please tell me, and I will simply ignore it 
from now on ...

TIA,
Herbert
