Well, ideas alone aren't enough.  They can be implemented badly,
or well.  There's lots of little issues that don't show
up until implementation.  There are even some ideas that looks
great on paper that don't work in practice.

So Sun spends more on Solaris than all open source together, and
still can't match linux wich only is a part of open source.
Dreaming up stuff isn't enough - some of the novelty lies in
a working good implemetation, not merely in the original abstract idea.
Ideas tend to lack in practical detail.

I don't think open source is so parasitic.  Commercial software
have a head start, open software is still catching up in many fields.
Thats why OSS often implementing old ideas. And they're implemented
well enough to out-compete commercial software. This is not
like a paraiste killing the host - OSS will go on even if _all_
commercial software dies. And then you'll see more new things too.

No problem at all.  Innovation will come from people, as it always have
done.  People will get ideas anyway.  Some will always get paid
for programming too, altough it will be more of a service
function than it is today.
