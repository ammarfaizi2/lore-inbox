This is clearly not my day for sending emails...

Sorry. The attachment was fine on last email but a little misunderstanding 
between elm and myself resulted in the invention of two non-existent email 
addresses and put them in the To: field. )-: Just remove them before 
replying... They are quite obvious: Linus@cus.cam.ac.uk, Torwalds@cus.cam.ac.uk

Just trying to preempt the flames I am bound to get for that mess up... At 
least I know how to do it properly next time. (-:
