Oh, yes it is.  GPL and commercial DO NOT COVER EVERYTHING, damnit.
And I don't fscking care for Oracle, IBM, etc. - there are folks doing
stuff under other free licenses and I find casual dismissing them
from consideration disgusting at extreme.  Especially if you take care
to count the amounts of good ideas that came from, say it, CSRG folks
and from Oracle.  Good ideas we are using.  Shame...
