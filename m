To add an option to the kobject_hotplug() function for a sync call is
one thing.  To make the option for the main kobject add and remove call
to be sync is a horribly misguided thought (the reason why is left as an
exercise for the reader...like go read the udev code for many reasons
why...)

I don't have an objection to add such a new paramater (or even a new
function call like you suggested), just don't go messing with the main
kobject hotplug call without thinking everything through :)

Please encourage them to speak up.  I hear _nothing_ from any embedded
developers, and I am really interested in how the driver model and
hotplug works (or doesn't) for them.  Without that feedback, we are in
the dark as to what their needs/hates are.
