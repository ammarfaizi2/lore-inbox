Curiously enough, my first hard drive was an ST-506 used with
an RLL controller for the usual 45% increase in capacity. All
I can say is that it worked fine from when I bought it new
(for £350.00) through to when I had to replace the (genuine
IBM) PC/XT motherboard after it failed.

The new motherboard was a 386dx/25 and had on-board IDE and
related, so I had to get an IDE drive at the same time.

Oh - yes, I was shocked at the speed difference between the
two systems. Then again, who wouldn't be...

Best wishes from Riley.
