Dear Friend. 

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for 
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. 

My name is DAVID ABDULLAH, a merchant in Dubai, in the 
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few 
months to live, according to medical experts. 

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I 
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my 
business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only 
focused on my business as that was the only thing I 
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know 
that there is more to life than just wanting to have 
or make all the money in the world. 

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come 
to this world I would live my life a different way 
from how I have lived it. Now that God  has called 
me, I have willed and given most of my property 
and assets to my immediate and extended family 
members as well as a few close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul 
so, I have decided to give alms to charity 
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last 
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed 
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, 
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself 
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one 
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have 
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and 
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to 
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as 
they seem not to be contended with what I have left 
for them. 

The last of my money which no one knows of is the 
huge cash deposit of twenty two million dollars 
$22,000,000,that I have with a finance/Security Company 
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit 
and dispatched it to charity organizations.


I have set aside 10% for you for your time and 
patience.please send a reply through this email address with your full contact information for more private and confidential communication. 

God be with you.
