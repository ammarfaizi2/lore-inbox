Hi to all,

i've bought a FastTrak100 TX2, with the chipset PDC20270 and Bios v2.00b2. 
I've tried to compile some new kernel (from 2.4.7 to 2.4.8 with AC patch), 
but there is no way to enable dma on the HD connected to the TX2.
Yes, I know that until now there is non support for 270, but I wish to know 
if the support for this chipset will be integrated in the near future.
Tnx Zam
