Dear Sir or Madam,

                              You can go parachuting, hang gliding, paintballing, gliding, fly a helicopter or a plane, and much more,  ABSOLUTELY FREE OF CHARGE, and help a charity at the same time!  
Or, you could simply make a small donation to one of the many charities that we support. 

For more information, go to:

Thank you very much for your support.
