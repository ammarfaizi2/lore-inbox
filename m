In the EU generally not. For hardware the normal approach is
to use patented interfaces to ensure for example that nobody can sell
replacement ink cartridges for your printer. For software its trickier
and corporations are still working on schemes

Trade secrets really only become a problem if you've seen the original for
other reasons. A microsoft employee leaving MS who spends the next month
writing an ntfs for unix is likely to get into some trouble 8)
