I understand that this is not necessarily a bug, but I need to quickly
determine why the HP VA7410 disk array is listed in the scsi_scan.c file,
and the implications and/or correctness of the flags attached to it.

Apologies if this is not the correct place to ask, but I need help urgently
on this one.

Thanks,
	David.
