Oh, and BTW, Linus, I never apologized for that shot. It was probably
the reason you don't walk around the Expo's at LinuxWorld.  I was the
first person to recognize you at the first LinuxWorldExpo in
San Fransisco in 1998 and walked up to ask for the photograph. After the
shot was taken, it attracted the attention of others in the area, and
then within seconds you were mobbed.  So I now apologize for causing you
that headache ;-)

And about that shot... Unfortunately(maybe?) the guy taking the picture
hit the button too quickly and neither of us were ready for it.  You
then looked at me and said "Well that should be an interesting photo"
and proceeded to walk away (just before being mobbed).

Thanks,

-- Steve
