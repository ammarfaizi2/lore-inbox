If you go "make install modules modules_install" it will use that file to
control exactly what is built and installed, and so (IMO, IANAL) it does
influence the resulting binary more than enough so that it has to be
considered a "source file" for that particular binary. That you can come up
with your own shouldn't make a difference (I can write, say, emacs' source
too given sufficient time ;-)
