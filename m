Alan,


***** Please BCC me in on any reply, not CC me.  Two reasons, I am not
on the LKML, and second I am suffering BIG time with SPAM from posting
to the mailing list.  Thanks in advance. *****


Thanks so much in your desire to include the patch in future 2.4.x-AC
tree(s).  Any chance this can make its way into the 2.2.21 tree at
some point?

Please BCC me by replacing yahoo.com after the "@" as follows"
TLD =         The last three letters of the word internet
Domain name = The first four letters of the word software,
              followed by the first four letters of the word
              homeless.
My appologies in advance for the jumbled eMail address
and request to BCC me, but SPAM has become a very serious
problem.  The eMail address in my header information is
not a valid eMail address for me.  I needed to use a valid
domain due to ISP SMTP screen rules.
