Not having any SATA CD burners, I can only go by my experience using USB 
and Firewire burners, which also appear to be SCSI. They work fine using 
the device name rather than playing with the ATA or ATAPI stuff. And if 
you're using ProDVD I suggest you download the latest cdrecord from the 
usual site and build that, DVD support is now in the cdrecord source, as 
it is in most distributions.

I use multiple PATA and USB burners on several systems, and haven't had 
problems. I actually do have SCSI devices, they have always worked and 
continue to (slowly) do so.

If you post again after trying the current source, please include the 
command used as well as the output from the log. By using the latest you 
at least MIGHT get some help from the author, instead of the usual 
"don't bother me with obsolete versions" reply.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
