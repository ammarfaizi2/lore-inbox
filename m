Perhaps, yes. Or that NAPI is using more CPU than non-NAPI
(which I understand can happen in some corner cases).

If you have a multiprocessor (or even hyperthreading), I
think you could test this by binding kswapd on cpu CPU, and
put nic interrupts on the other - then test with and without
NAPI.

That is, presuming you can reproduce the problem on your
multiprocessor system in the first place.
