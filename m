Hi,

    Could someone tell me how well supported the Athlon SMP on the Tyan
Athlon SMP board is?  Does it work on both 2.2.x and 2.4.x?

    I'd also like to know the status of VIA P3 SMP support?  I previously
heard of problems using 2.2.x on VIA SMP.  Will this be fixed?  Or is there
someway to work around the problems?

    Unfortunately I may have no choice but to stick to 2.2.x as I may
require the use of the iBCS module to run SCO binaries and the 2.4.x
iBCS-type module(s) have not worked for me yet, plus my own attempt at
porting iBCS has been delayed.

    Thanks for any help.
