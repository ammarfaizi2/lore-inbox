He's not allowed to say "BitBucket is a GPL-ed clone of BitKeeper"
because that implies that BitBucket does what BitKeeper does and nothing
could be farther from the truth.

How about we not turn this into a debate?  I politely requested that
people not confuse the world into thinking Product A is the same as
Product B, that's all I requested, it's a reasonable request, we don't
need to debate it.  If you feel the need to do so, go for it, but do so
knowing that my silence in no way means that I agree or disagree with you.
