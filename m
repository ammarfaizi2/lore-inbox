	You didn't need to copy all that, this is well known.  But you
were talking a quite different story, about invalidating licenses and
such.  I fail to see the relation, as the original message from
Stallman was about a proprietary lock-in game threat.

	I can't quite see your point... what's the problem with a
clone?  It certainly isn't immoral or illegal.  An EULA tastes no
better comming from McVoy than coming from Gates.  Cloning of Unix,
BTW, was performed by a young Finnish student some years ago, and now
there's a nasty US company going after people who helped
him... certainly this is proof cloning is bad?

	So what's the problem exactly?

	Which game?

	BTW, can you answer what's so fantastic about the OSL apart
from allying with ESR instead of RMS?  Are you trying to take sides in
an ego clash, or do you have arguments supporting one or another in a
rational conversation?
