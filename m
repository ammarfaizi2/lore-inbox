Sorry, I do not know, simply because it is not like a "pound of apples"
which one can buy in a supermarket, i.e. there are complex things like
"bundles" and other entities which may contain vxfs (as well as other
VERITAS products) which one may have to buy to get it.

I retained cc:linux-kernel so that people don't think there is something
secretive going on, but the discussion of proprietary products' pricing is
most likely offtopic... :)
