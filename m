Well, even if those who uses a rootkit are many more than those who knows
how to use a buffer exploit, that doesn't mean they represent more than 5%
of all computer users.

My stepfather just recently figured out that you can actually DRAG a window
around the desktop. I don't think he will be using a rootkit in some time,
and I am pretty sure he don't know anyting about SSSCA, nor will he, nor
will he be able to understand if I told him.

(btw. I might very well be ~69.5% off topic now, as I missed some of the
conversation)
