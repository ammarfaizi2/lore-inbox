How about:

for some alternative ways to the end.

Dean, mate, give up.  This is a battle you will not win, and it would 
preserve the freedom you wish to have more if you did not fight. 
Unfortunately, the tension between IP, profit, and technological progress 
is complex.  Fortunately, there is room in the ecosystem for many views, 
and some of us are capable of holding different views for different 
projects.

I really respect Andre for what he's trying to do, and for what he has 
done.  I don't see any history which gives me any reason to respect you, 
and you're wearing out your default credit real fast.  My own history is 
more at the IETF than in Linux, but check out something called HIP and the 
manet working group for an example.  And www.indranet.co.nz too.  I only 
mention these because they're kind of obscure in the Linux context.

Andrew
