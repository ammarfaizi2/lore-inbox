CF cards in IDE mode appear as ATA disk not ATAPI

It basically changes the removable drive behaviour. It could
also be useful for knowing when we need to be careful as
CF cards are both fragile and have some different commands.

What is the CF card connected to. One possibility is that
something after boot is powering the CF card off and on or
switching its mode before we see it.
