Yeah, and I wasn't thrilled about it, I can tell you that.  I had the 
same starry eyed idealistic idea that things would just work out and
they don't.  So we're essentially in a proprietary model with a funky
dual free/pay licensing model.  That's OK for us because the money 
people value their privacy.

Actually, that's an interesting topic.  Other applications could use
the BK model of "free if you're out in the open" and pay otherwise.
It's pretty effective.  However, it doesn't work very well when the
community beats you to hell for not being GPLed.  I had a thick enough
skin to deal with it, I doubt others would, they'd give up.  It also
doesn't work when people refuse to obey the license because they 
don't agree with it (we had plenty of that).

That leads to the real question: what is an acceptable model for the
community and the vendor for applications which don't work under the
standard GPL model?

Agreed, but his thought was to make it non-voluntary.  I have my doubts
about that working too, but there ought to be something which would work.
