Larry,

I know your post was directed at RMS, however I felt inspired to respond :) 
Perhaps there is an alternate outcome to the future you see, bare with me.

Add to this:

No Software patents or greatly shorting the length of 
software patents.

All hardware specs are published.

You seem to view software like a chair or a box of legos?  Something that 
is designed, implemented and then sold.  This is the predominant view, 
perhaps software can be thought of as simply: 
Ideas + Skill + Time + Natural Resources.

Am I correct in thinking that your two primary goals in relation to 
software development are?:

1) For _individuals_ to make a good/great living. 
2) Software is constantly improved/evolves and that new and innovative 
ideas have fertile ground to develop in.

If so, I believe we are in complete agreement thus far.

In a world where all software is "Free Software" does it not make more 
sense to view the "costs" of software development as being equal to 
ideas+time+skill+available resources?

You must have the idea/problem/design to begin a software project.

You must have the time and skill available to complete the design or solve 
the problem.

Reusable code decreases the amount of time and perhaps skill required to 
complete software tasks.

I would argue that most of the problems you see in a 100% "Free 
Software" World come from a large Enterprise/corporate mind set, where large 
Sums of VC money is required to fund projects.  I see a 
possible future where software development is seen much like getting your 
roof repaired, or adding a new room on to your house.  It's 
labor+materials.  With the advantage that in software world materials are 
reusable, the tools are plentiful and affordable (well most anyways).  In 
this World it's the software developers who are sought after... not the 
VC money.  

Could this Free Software world support Microsoft or it's ilk? No.  Could 
it feed the families of millions of software developers?  I believe so.
