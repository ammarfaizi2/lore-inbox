	There's a difference between people thinking they are being bullied and 
being a bunch of bullies. ;)

	I would hope that the situation would be explained politely -- kind of like 
this:  "Unfortunately, with closed-source software, only someone who has the 
source code can debug it. If you can replicate the problem without any 
closed-source drivers, we'll do our best to help you. But if you can only 
replicate the problem with a closed-source module installed, odds are the 
problem is in that module, and even if it wasn't, we couldn't track it down."

	That doesn't really seem like bullying and helps to clarify the 
disadvantages of using closed-source software.
