Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,
and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this 
contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in 
the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and 
immense benefit. 

I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make 
this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly
to you. My name is  Chuli Savimbi, I am the eldest son and Personal Assistant 
to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address 
from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence 
this email. 

My father(Mentor) was killed in a battle with
government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd 
February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in 
command, assumed office 
as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my
father had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for 
leadership. 


Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office 
as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their 
ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned
to kill me. 

The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable
when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my father's death. As I lost my mentor in this 
struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle 
interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a 
peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts
and wars. 

For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here
(Holland) to seek political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your
highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my father's money 
that arose from Diamonds sales. 

This money (US$20.5million), which was already on its way to my father's Swiss 
Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was 
on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, 
europe in February when the tragic incident of my father's death occurred. 

I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money 
pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for 
security reasons, 
and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, 
the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe 
deposit. 

President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my 
father's assets and accounts abroad, to ground
UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in 
my name. 

Also I did not declare the funds to any authority for obvious reasons   there,I 
plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you 
understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is 
extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to loose this 
money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost 
secrecy.

Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money 
which is deposited in my name, from the
Security company, after which, the money will  be lodged into an account 
preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.

  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in 
this country is granted, and 
I have permission to do business and open an account
here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with
15%($3.075,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the
consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the 
security company, and the release codes of the vaults.

 Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, 
and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt 
response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance
in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me on the 
above email or musa_yu@hotmail.com  This will 
enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.
