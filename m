I tried to make the point that top posting is useful when (and only when)
it is short and does not require the context of the previous posts, it
saves the reader time to have it all up front.

Example 1:
  Subject: 2.6.0-test2-ac1 OOPS with ZIP and DVD

  Appropriate top post:
    Fixed in 2.6.0-test2-ac2

  Why:
    Topic is dead, problem over, casual reader spends no more time on it


Example 2:
  Subject: Odd O(1) behaviour with SCSI tape and serial PPP

  Appropriate top post:
    The measurements Jonas requested appear below interspersed with his
    questions.

  Why:
    If you want details you won't miss this post, if you are only
    concerned with patches or discussion of root cause you might skip
    this one.


A short top post takes the place of the Summary header most folks can't
generate or see. Used properly it's a benefit, used as the examples Thomas
posted it's disgusting.
