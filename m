	Do you agree that:

	1) A person who thinks of an idea cannot be compelled to disclose it,
especially since nobody would even know that he had it unless he told them
and that therefore absent a contract or other agreement to the contrary, may
refrain from disclosing it to others.

	2) The greater includes the lesser.

	In any event, my dictionary defines "property" as "something tangible or
intangible to which the owner has legal title".

	Who said anything about "property law"? All I'm talking about, and all I
need, is contract law. What I'm saying is that contractual property acts
like property but it wholly covered by contract law.

	If I acquire from you the transferrible right to one day of your lawn
mowing, I have something. It acts like property -- a person can own it,
transfer it, control it. Yet it's not covered by real property law. If you
fail to mow the lawn, I wouldn't argue property law, I'd argue contract law.
The right is a contractual right but it, in every essential way, acts like
property.

	Absolutely. That's what I'm saying. Intellectual "property" rights are,
morally and conceptually, based in contract law. This is because, unlike
real property, intellectual property consists solely of the right to
control, to some extent, what other people can do.

	Play word games if you want, but people use the term "property" to cover
intangibles if you can have the exclusive right to them.

	I disagree. As a single example, independent creation is a defense to a
copyright infringement claim. However, a patent holder need not prove that
the infringer got the idea from him at all.

	Sure, but patent law doesn't stop them from failing to disclose just they
didn't have to before. That is, patent law didn't take away your ability to
keep an invention secret. Nor does it stop you from enforcing contractual
secrecy agreements in the absence of a patent, so you can still use
contractual techniques or even quasi-contractual technques like trade
secrets.

	As they still can if they wish. However, patent law gave them something
they never had under contract or property laws -- the right to control other
people's use of "their" ideas even if the others developed them wholly
independently.

	They always had that. They just write a contract that says so and compel
everyone who receives the work to sign the contract. In fact, copyright
behaves just like an implied contract.

	All you would have had to do was state, before the play, that listening to
the play is contingent on their agreement not to further distribute it. Can
you give me any rational reason such a contract wouldn't be enforceable?

	Obviously, I 100% disagree with you.

	I agree with you. I don't believe that I ever said contracts are the
"basis" of real property ownership. However, you can, purely by contract
law, obtain much the same thing as real property ownership with no actual
legal transfer of the title. The distinctions are largely artificial legal
ones, though admittedly created for legitimate and useful purposes.

	It is useful to have an actual "owner" for physical object in a way that it
is not useful to have an actual "owner" for an idea. This is the basis for
the laws covering real property.

	However, there is another sense of "owner" which still includes the right
of control, use and exclusion. It is this type of ownership that is acquired
by explicit or implicit contract, and it is this type of property that
intellectual property falls into.

	Tell me anything significant that copyright law does that an author could
not do by requiring anyone to whom he discloses his idea to sign an
appropriate contract. Tell me anthing copyright law does that contract law
can't do.
