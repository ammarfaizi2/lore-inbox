It's still plenty small enough for many many embedded uses and most
people are more than happy with it. The reason that it's not even smaller
is no one has stepped forward to do the trimming. It's easy enough to
do, but we can only assume from the fact that no one's done so is that
it's really not that important.

If you think it's important, either make it happen or pay someone else
to make it happen.
