Which would tell you exactly that, nothing more and nothing less. No idea
how many users it would support reading mail via IMAP, if playing Quake on
it is doable, or whether it is a good idea to use it as a firewall or
development machine. Computer systems are very complex, their uses much
more so (and extremely varied to boot); to believe some number (or even a
small set of numbers) will tell you everything there is to know about a
particular box is just an illusion. And a box rarely stands in isolation.
