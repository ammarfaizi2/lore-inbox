If you have a bus.opp or
m..l..m/net workmktg. company I can
help you generate over 20 paid/sign
_ups and show you how to get 20
every week 52 weeks a year.

Would you like over 20 paid/sign_ups
each week just like 100's of other
people are getting?

Let me mentor you for "no charge".

=====================================

I will show you how to get paid/for
sign/ups eas.ily and without spending
a dime/penny on normal mark.eting.

I would like to men/tor you personally
to make a brand and name for myself.

I will men/tor you on a "121" basis
and provide you with contact details
of "pre-qualified" people who may
want to join_your_business.

I can boost your bus/iness's-profit
by up to 500% more than it currently
makes and that's a 100% guarantee.

I can help you.

I will mentor you.

There is no restriction to the type of
business you want me to help you build.

To find out if I can mentor you please send
me an email to:

subject and your business name, URL and own
name in the message body.

============================================
I reserve the right to refuse my service to 
anyone without breaching my code of conduct 
or advertising standards. In such instances
I am not obliged to give a reason for
refusal of my mentoring service.

you this email please forgive me and send

word "off" in the subject and I will 
never bother you again.
