....this is getting way OT...everyone wants make Linux work well for all programming
methods as long as poor compromises are not made...most of the people that matter
on this list can define "poor" so I am not worried about the future of Linux.

Last 0.02 below and this should be take off the list.

Most of the time this is true...kinda depends on the project and other constraints.
I'd hate to make a system that has poor $$/hw when scaling it just because the programmers are lazy.

Good developers are hard to find , period.

My experience is that there are a whole bunch of people out there that have
ONLY coded Java and they should not be let near a computer.

Very debatable ... and the point I was making was not about C ... for example, Java servlets and JSP
are probably a very big part of the Java app "world"...I'd take PHP over that
any day for apps that require a DHTML GUI on a database...just depends on what you
are doing and your requirements...would you write a device driver in Java?...
what I find stunning about Java (and I said this before) is that :
"Java is not particularly good at anything (jack of all trades master of none)."

Yup...hard decisions. No silver bullet.
