Hi,

I've documented x86/i386/IA-32 Linux kernel init
(after loaders).  It's fairly large, so there may be
too much detail here and I may cut back on it some if
that seems to be needed.

Comments, feedback, corrections, and additions are
welcome.  As I say in the intro, hopefully some of you
(or us) will find this useful/helpful.

It's viewable at
