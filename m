The Morse Code we are talking about is not the "rip-snorting" 20
words/per/minute that Radio Operators and Hams use. Instead it's
the 3 to 5 words/per/minute code you hear on aircraft navigation
radios, used by all pilots to identify navigation aids. The
'beep' you hear from a ^G is the "dash". A shorter one makes the
"dot".
