I remember seeing something about how some via ide chipsets (686b I think)
and [some?] ide promise controllers had problems with data corruption on
the IBM dtla-series udma drives, and that IBM stated the problem was with
the controllers.  Is there a chance a problem like that could be screwing
up the kernel?
