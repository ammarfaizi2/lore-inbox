Linux really has swapper process ;)

I'm writing kernel module that hooks into netfilter code. I can catch
packet's information and its owner process. The first SYN packet of
handshaking belongs to real user-space socket/process. After timeout,
several SYN packets are generated by kernel-space swapper process (PID
0) Is there anyway to find out the relationship between them in
_kernel_space_ (module context).

Thanks,
Mikado.
