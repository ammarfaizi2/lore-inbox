No problem.  Just thought wyou might like to know in case you were
unaware of a technical problem.

Ok, the other key is now up and should be making it way to the other
key servers.  I did not post the 0x99ed3565 key, as I had not heard of
the 0x6eeaf716 key was loaded correctly.

There are other solutions.  For now I need to use this solution until
I have the current matter purged and under control before using a more
effective solution beyond filtering.

"Boooomer ... Boom Boom, how are you Boom Boom" Boomer 1985 -
February/2000


***** Please BCC me in on any reply, not CC me.
Two reasons, I am not on the Mailing List,
and second I am suffering BIG time with SPAM
from posting to mailing lists/Newsgroups.
Instructions on real address at bottom.
Thanks in advance. *****


Please BCC me by replacing after the "@" as follows:
TLD =         The last three letters of the word "internet"
Domain name = The first four letters of the word "software",
              followed by the first four letters of the word
              "homeless".
My appologies in advance for the jumbled eMail address
and request to BCC me, but SPAM has become a very serious
problem.  The eMail address in my header information is
not a valid eMail address for me.  I needed to use a valid
domain due to ISP SMTP screen rules.

Please note: You may experience delays in my replies.  I will
             reply.

             This is due to major restoration activity to my riser
             section of the building.

             My internet access will be limited to a couple weekday
             evenings.  Weekend access will be a bit better but
             limited as an indirect consequence of the restoration
             work.

             If for any reason you need a more immediate reply or
             fail to receive a reply, please phone and leave a
             message.  If you do leave a phone message, please note
             that I may not be able to hear the message and/or
             reply until the evening.  This will be due to the
             extensive noise levels of the restoration work
             activity drowning out most other volume levels of
             sound.

             The work starts 22 July 2002.  Based on similar
             experience to other sections of the building I would
             estimate the major noise element of the work to be
             about 4+ weeks for my riser.  There will be secondary
             instances once other ajacent riser sections are done
             that will have a similar impact, but for lessor
             periods of time.

             My appologies in advance, but this is mandated work
             that must be done.
