I think you misunderstand me.  If IBM considers a feature to be useful,
they should require distributions to put into a release from a contractual
standpoint.  That doesn't mean Red Hat has to put it into all their
distributions -- it just means they have to produce something that
IBM wants.  If nobody else uses it, that's fine.  IBM gets what they
want, and Red Hat gets what they want.  End of story.

You're looking at this from an engineering perspective and open source
philosophy rather than a business unit at a company like IBM might look
at it.  That's not a bad thing to do, but the two concepts are very
different from each other.  The Linux world may filter "crap", which
is great, but some of that "crap" is important to companies like IBM,
and if they were smart they'd use their leverage ($$$) to make sure the
"crap" ends up in the products they care to use/support.  The rest of
Linux can do whatever it wants, doing things the "Linux world" way.

Again, I wasn't mentioning any product in particular.  Making decisions
like GPL-only as an engineering philosophy rather than as a product
marketing decision are more problematic than looking at EVMS vs. anything
else as a question of which is technically better.

But again, that's a complete aside and would probably open up a plethora
of opinions from people who care about both sides of that argument, and
would inevitably head down an rathole infinitely deep.
