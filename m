So what? Yes sometimes the spam coming through this
list triggers a bounce. So what? What is an occasional
bounce message a problem for you? Why don't you just
ignore a few bounces? The list seems to be far more
tollerant of spam than it is if a message bounces
every now and then.

majordomo is an ancient piece of software. I don't
understand why this list doesn't use a more modern
platform like Mailman that automatically deal with
bounce processing. It tracks bounces and it can tell
if a message is a fluke bounce or if an email address
it permanently down. For some reason you are making a
huge deal over nothing. You act as if a bounce is a
crime.
