I know that the subject of drivers for this broadcom chipset has been
raised before.  But, what information is missing that prevents the
development of these drivers?  Perhaps a little social engineering is in
order...  I mean, this chipset has been out for a while and there don't
seem to be any signs of development (h3ll, if we poke at it long enough
we'll get it) for this chipset.  is there just a lack of ambition here, or
is there something REAL keeping this from going forth.   I mean, I'm having
to write this email from windows just because this driver doesn't
exist...and that brings me great sadness...

Any, thoughts?  I'm sorry if I have missed something obvious here...I'm no
driver developer...so, my understanding of the situation may be off.  But,
h3ll...I'm motivated... ;)
