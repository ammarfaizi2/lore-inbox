Yes you are right it is a 4-port sata-II 300 card (PDC40718 ). According to
the promise feature list it should support :

SATA300â„¢ TX4 Highlights

    * Native Command Queuing (NCQ)
    * SATA Tagged Command Queuing (TCQ)
    * Large LBA support for drives above 137GB
    * Supports Serial ATAPI devices
    * Disk Activity LED Headers
    * Flexible future-proof upgrade for users with motherboards that
      only have a PCI interface


My question is also are these features (NCQ/TCQ) and the heigher 
datarate be supported by this
modification? or is only the basic feature set of sata 150 TX4 supported?

Here is the patch:
