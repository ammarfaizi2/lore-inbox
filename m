>Believe me, it's childish. Nobody on lkml need/want to be defended.
AMEN. Andre doesn't defend anyone, just offends :)

Well ok he thinks "a guy called Tyketto" is correct in saying the kernel has been translated to ADA.

But people need to have free speech, y'know I believe LKML doesn't 
want that, 
otherwise my other address wouldnt have been blocked ;-)

And anyway as I've already said, lifes a bitch. (thats right a female
dog)

>RMS using a PRINTER hits LM with a pounding blown to the rear.
Not until he's made the high tech ink squirter work in Hurd :)

P.S 
Q. If I calmly, rationally, and clearly state things which are not true,
are self serving, and are not relevant to a forum, what should I expect
in response?

A. Andre's praise.
