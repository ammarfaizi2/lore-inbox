You realize using a non-RH kernel on RHEL isn't a supported 
configuration.. and if you are fine with this, why are you paying out 
the money for RHEL instead of using Fedora or CentOS, etc. if you don't 
care about support?

There are other issues with this, as well.. RHEL4 with 2.6 probably 
doesn't suffer as many side effects as RHEL3 does since that kernel is 
closer to mainline. Running a vanilla 2.4 kernel on RHEL3 would be 
rather crippling - that kernel is closer to 2.6 than 2.4 in some ways.
