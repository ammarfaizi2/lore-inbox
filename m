I have the latest kernel (2.4.6) with the patch (2.4.6-ac5) from 
www.bzimage.com, which corrects the problem, however, the ACPI module is 
still buggered. I have informed the ACPI maintainer, however, I have not 
received an email of confirmation yet.

Hopefully (fingers crossed), the problem will be sorted out before the next 
release.
