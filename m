I haven't written a line of code for this yet on Linux, but I have kept 
this design in my head and evolved it over the years in the back of my 
head.  Wiki's come close in terms of the ideas but that's only a shadow 
of what was conceived so long ago.  I have watched the industry 
patiently for many years on this list, waiting, and I have seen some 
elements of this scheme emerge, but have been disappointed since humans 
just seem to feel more comfortable inside the box, and not go out of it.

I've worked extensively in the Linux VFS and I/O subsystems and created 
companies that have sold for millions of dollars with specialized file 
systems with extreme levels of performance.   I believe I can finally 
pull this off in Linux.  This is a big project, and I cannot do it 
alone.  I also dislike the GPL because it concedes control of something 
kernel.org could copyright as "the organization of kernel.org" and 
control over the internet and allow healthier businesses to grow around 
it.  I am proposing not just a file system or clustering, but a unique 
architecture and new communication model for the internet for 
collaborative sharing at the kernel level with distributed data and 
routing facilities and disconnectable operations.  It does not resemble 
anything that exists today.  This FS will not be released under the GPL 
but the BSD-mod license on Linux with a kicker that contributors can 
retain copyrights.   Since binary modules are allowed, any contributor 
gets a share of the booty -- Just for fun.  
 
Al Petrofsky and Pamela Jones managed to hornswaggle the Novell 
Settlement agreement onto the internet, and it speaks for itself.  At 
this point, people I think know there are no IP claims related to any 
"intallagible knowledge."   So now it's time.  I have my own NOS, but I 
had always wanted to share, which for some reason you folks never get 
that part.   I am doing this "Just for Fun" at this point and for no 
other reason.   I dropped the lawsuits and flushed out the turkeys, and 
its time to get back to work.  This time without the "sword of damacles" 
hanging over my head.  It's pretty hard to get the whole internet to 
hate you, but somehow I succeeded.  Now time to pay the dues.

Give me a couple of days, and I will be starting on my off time.    I 
work best alone, but we will see how it goes.   I've had more than 
enough of the wire brush of enlightenment in the last year, so I think 
I'm well on my way to playing better in the sandbox. 

White papers will be up in the next several weeks on the wiki.  I need 
to go over with folks who are interested in building a metropolitan area 
network architecture in a collaborative setting the layout and 
architecture and it needs to be flushed out.    I am doing this for me 
alone and just for the fun of building it.   This is something Novell 
doesn't have, Darl McSwine doesn't have, and M$ doesn't have.  Let's get 
there first.  It will appear FIRST on the Linux Operating System.
