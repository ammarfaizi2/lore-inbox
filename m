Really?  So, since in a few messages back you claimed that it has a fully
supported userland which implements all of P1003.1 as well as sockets,
obviously, since it is a networking operating system, it should be the 
work of a few minutes to download LMbench, compile it, and come back with
the lat_tcp performance numbers which "kicks Linux's but".  Please do so.
