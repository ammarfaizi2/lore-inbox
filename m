Hi,
Sorry to disturb you.

I am in the process of writing a file system on 2.2.14 kernel similar to
ramfs on 2.4 kernel. I feel I should put some debug statements in the vfs
code and check the working. Please help me by trelling me how to compile
code in the vfs layer and add it to kernel. This info would be very
helpful for me and I am stuck up here.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
sathish
