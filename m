This would have been better said as "the load generated by 1 task" 
rather than just "a scaled version of 1".  Numerically, they're the same 
but one is clearer than the other and makes it more obvious why we need 
NICE_TO_BIAS_PRIO(0) * SCHED_LOAD_SCALE and where we need it.

I'm just testing this at the moment.
