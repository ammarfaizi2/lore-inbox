Ok,
Maybe I am just lost and confused, but I can't see anywhere what has
happened to this patch....

Did it get merged when I wasn't looking?  I can't seem to find a record of
it in the change logs?  It just seems to stop getting updated just before
2.4.18 release, but I don't see a message about it getting merged....

Could someone please update me?

Is it in 2.4.19 someplace, or  2.5.x?
