  (if any of these observations are going to the wrong list,
or are based on some fundamental misunderstanding of kernel
configuration, please let me know so i can minimize 
my embarrassment. :-)

  before i post any more observations on what i think are 
inconsistencies, here's another example, so i can be sure
that these are worth pointing out:

  even if, under "Networking options", i deselect IPv6,
i'm still presented with an inactive IPv6 Netfilter Configuration
screen.

  is *that* the sort of thing we're talking about?
