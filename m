Andrew uses BK too.  He extends its function by maintaining a set of patches
above and beyond the committed BK tree...  Ted made a really valid point.  The
people at the top _are_ _very_ _very_ important.  

There are several ways to get kernel source if _you_ do not want to use BK.  I 
use BK.  There are enough projects around that I can avoid working on a SVM 
for a year...  Thats my option though - you do not have to agree.
