Hi all,
I just tried to build 2.4.10-ac11 and I got the following. Any idea what
is going on here?

make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.4.10ac11/arch/i386/lib'
ld -m elf_i386 -T /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/kernel-2.4.10ac11/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds

The following is the config file I used. With the exception of 1 parameter
I changed for the sound card it is the same as I used for 2.4.10-ac10, which
is working fine.

If someone needs more info I would be happy to provide it.

Thanks,
