You know guys, Larry would spend a lot less time having to make threats
like this if people didn't start off by saying "Let's see how we can get a free
Bitkeeper".   I've seen *LOTS* of philosophical posturing and arguing about
whether it's moral to rip Larry's software off, and what countries make it legal
to do so.

I've only seen *ONE* person (who's name I've forgotten but who needs to be
praised) suggest finding some *FUNDING* for Larry so he doesn't worry about his
revenue stream getting hosed.

So Larry - *IF* funding was there, would you consider a business model similar
to Hans Reiser's?
