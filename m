The only source for the OS that came 'for free' that I can recall for the
PDP-11 was RSX-11- but that was only the bare kernel. The filesystem and the
utilities's source wwas not available. At that time, as you can probably well
recall, the UNIX source licence from WECO was 40K$ for v7 at Sidereal.

Don't applaud either Intel or IBM too loudly. In particular, Intel. Just *try*
and get documentation about their frickin' gigabit ethernet chip out of them.
