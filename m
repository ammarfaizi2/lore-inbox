Dear Al,

Reading your reaction was intresting. I / We can clearly see you had an 
education....all those intelligent words.... you where paying attention 
that time....

But reading it again made me think that it's your subconscious reacting 
with these words. In fact you see yourself as:

   acrid, aggressive, antagonist, antagonistic, antipathetic, ardent,
   argumental, argumentative, attacking, battler, battling, bellicose,
   belted knight, bickerer, bickering, bitter, blade, bloodthirsty,
   bloody, bloody-minded, bravo, brawler, bully, bullyboy,
   cat-and-dog, cat-and-doggish, caustic, chauvinist, chauvinistic,
   clashing, colliding, combatant, combative, competitor, conflicting,
   contender, contentious, contestant, controversial, despiteful,
   disputant, disputatious, divisive, duelist, enemy, enforcer,
   eristic, factional, factious, fencer, ferocious, feuder, fierce,
   fighter, fighting, fighting cock, foilsman, full of fight,
   full of hate, gamecock, gladiator, goon, gorilla, hatchet man,
   hateful, hawk, hawkish, hood, hoodlum, hooligan, hostile, hot,
   inimical, invading, irascible, irritable, jingo, jingoish,
   jingoist, jingoistic, jouster, knight, litigious, malevolent,
   malicious, malignant, martial, militant, militaristic, military,
   offensive, partisan, plug-ugly, polarizing, polemic, pugnacious,
   quarreler, quarrelsome, rancorous, repugnant, rioter, rival, rough,
   rowdy, ruffian, saber-rattling, sabreur, sanguinary, sanguineous,
   savage, scrapper, scrappy, scuffler, set against, shrewish,
   soldierlike, soldierly, sore, spiteful, squabbler, strong arm,
   strong-arm man, strong-armer, struggler, swashbuckler, sword,
   swordplayer, swordsman, tempered, thug, tilter, tough,
   trigger-happy, truculent, tussler, unfriendly, unpacific,
   unpeaceable, unpeaceful, venomous, virulent, vitriolic, warlike,
   warmonger, warmongering, warring, wrangler, wrangling

But that's that...

Calling names is a special game for infants / children and i don't like 
those games so i won't play them. Thank you for the inside of your 
personality...

If i remember right you missed those classes about Ethology 101....

But never the less i reached my point. So it's finished for me.

I like to thank you AL for your comment, some crustaceans are what they 
are.....


Regards,


Gabriel Kenter
