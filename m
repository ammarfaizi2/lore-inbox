   Here I thought we had Republicans fighting to make the US a republic and
   Democrats fighting to make it a Democracy. Oh well, my mistake. Can
   someone start a seperate mailing list maybe linux-kernel-legal. It would
   be a good place for this and discussion of any other new laws, US and
   other that effect the kernel hackers. As a bonus it wouldn't distract from
   the patches.

The EFF and many other organizations concerned about the DMCA issues
have suitable public lists for discussion of this topic.  I do not see
a need for a new vger list.

You can just as well take this 2.2.x changelog thread there.  In fact,
they're probably already talking about it :-)

Franks a lot,
