I am trying to use the data port of parallel port to receive data, so I set the bit 5 of the control port to enable the bi-directional port, but it doesn't work.  My parallel supports SPP/EPP/ECP mode, does it support bi-directional mode?  if yes, how can I config it?

I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in response to my posting. Thank you.

Best Regards,
Anton
