IYes, it happens naturaly, but it's done when we try to write to it.
What I meant was, at fork time, it we are forking to a different node,
instead of COW-marking, do the COW-mark and the immediately do a sort-of
for_each_page(touch_as_if_written(page)), so that nodes would not have to
reference the memory from others.

I don't know if it's really usefull, and anyways I could not try to code it
unless there is a sort of NUMA simulator for "normal" machines.

Greets, Antonio.
