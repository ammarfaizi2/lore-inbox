Subject: ds: socket Drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello again,

I was watching the bootup of the 2.4.1 kernel
on my machine and noticed that the message
ds: no socket drivers loaded showed up during
bootup.  The machine seems to boot fine, and 
everything works.  Is this a problem?  Whats 
the deal?

Thanks,

Ryan
