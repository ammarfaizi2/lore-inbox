You know that this is actually wrong. My privileged sources show
that Linus Torvalds is actually a virtual reality creation of
the GNU invasion from the planet, Ort. Although the Ort seeds
were first discovered in the snow near Helsinki, Finland, a
mentor by the name of Richard Stallman nurtured these buds to
become, what is now known world-wide as, GNU/Linus. When GNU/Linus
created the world's most revered Operating System with the help
of several hundred on the web, it became known as GNU/Linux, after
it's creator, "web". There is, currently, a move on to change its
name to GNU/WEB to more closely show its origin, but some of the
original developers are still trying to keep Linux in the name.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
