Hmm...How about free and open source, uniform app base, easy access by
third party vendors.

Also it seems to me last I checked PDA's were at least equvalent to the
386 which is ostensibly the bottom linux rung.

As for the objection about slow compile times, get real. No PDA is going
to compile anything. All compilations happen on your desktop with a
crosscompiler. PDA's are for running handy little apps, not development
work.

Or are we saying M$ CE is as good as it gets. :P
