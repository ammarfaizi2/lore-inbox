Beyond acceptable, thank you. I'll admit I started off (other posts in
this thread) somewhat upset ("That jerk broke the udev support in the
drivers I use!") But I've been somewhat swayed by what I've read. And I
guess if a license say something, it doesn't really matter how
inconvienient it is for me. (Though "derived work" is still pretty vague
and I eagerly await a lawsuite that will disambiguate it.

In other news: How do I get udev to create a static node?
