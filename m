Intel is pleased to announce the launch of an open source project to
extend the current Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Driver project (IPW2200) to
support Master (Access Point) mode. The project site is up and in the
coming weeks you can expect initial source to become available providing
the limited access point functionality. This will be a point release, and
the code is intended to be used as it however any bug fixes and patches
are welcome.

The project is hosted at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipw2200-ap.  A
development mailing list is available (linked from the top of the
IPW2200-AP project page or
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ipw2200-ap-devel) so if you
are interested in this project, go subscribe to the mailing list and/or
set yourself up to monitor the file releases.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
York
