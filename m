Hi, I have a suggestion for any upcoming version of the kernel, if you could
pass this on to the appropriate people who might be interested in tackling
this project.  I would like to see, if possible, support for the Philips
CDD4801 CD-R/RW.  Your work on this would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Clint Maxwell
