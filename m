Just to say thanks again for your help - got 2.6.11.7 going everywhere
without hitches. Of course I just called the kernels 2.6.11.7 everywhere
so one version of the nvidia module fitted all.

I also stuck it on a Dell laptop I've got - a Latitude 100L - and at
last I've got ACPI working so I can see the battery level before it
dies.

Maybe our "visitor" did us a favour. (Sort of).
