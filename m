Whoops, sorry, didn't mean to get down on the driver folks.  It's hard to
make a point without pissing someone off...

Hey, I think Linux's driver support is amazingly good, no disrespect was
intended.  I'm not so sure that it a fertile ground for new ideas, drivers
are basically still trying to provide open/close/read/write/strategy/ioctl
semantics, aren't they?  If they aren't, I'd ask if that is a good thing
but that's a different topic.

Sorry to rile you up, Greg, you're the last person I'd want to do that to.
My apologies.
