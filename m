Yeah, what he said.

My ruleset looks kinda like this:

  Larry contributing BK
     ==>  good, flames inappropriate

  Larry being an overbearing, thin-skinned, asshole
     ==>  bad, flames appropriate

  Developers using BK
     ==>  their choice, tread lightly

  Developers promoting non-BK systems in their sig
     ==>  their choice, tread lightly

  Andrea's sig in particular
     ==>  pretty damn innocuous; why on earth is Larry whining about it?
