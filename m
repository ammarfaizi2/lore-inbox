I saw this as added support in pre7-ac1:

Add SIS646 (645DX) PCI idents for AGP        (Murray Root)

I have tried in vain to get agpgart to load with 2.4.20-pre10-ac1 after 
enabling
SiS support in character devices.

Any more news on this SiS AGP 5591/5592 support I would be sincerely 
interested in.

Thanks,

Frank
