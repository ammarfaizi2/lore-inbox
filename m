Dear Sir, 

I am Mr Williams Johnson,iam  the account officer To Late Mr. Hanson Cox
S.,a national of your country, On the 21st of April 2002, my client was
involved in a car accident.Unfortunately he lost his life. 
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the Bank where this huge deposit was lodged. The bank where the deceased
had an account valued at about $19.8 Million dollars Has issued me a notice
to provide the next of kin or have the account Confiscated within the next
twenty one official working days. 
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives, I now seek your
consent to present you as the next of kin Of the deceased since the deceased
is a forgnier, so that the Proceeds of this account valued at $19.8 Million
dollars can be paid to you,subsequently to be shared among us If you agree,
we can discuss your percentage. I have all necessary Legal documents that
can be used to back up any claim we may make. 
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction
through. 
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of the law. 
Awaiting your response in  my private email address williamsjohnsons@yahoo.co.uk
