So as a user you are free to not use M$ products.
What if you are IT. Then you do not have a choice.

I have been working as a Computer Tech for approx 5 years.
When I first started (before that period actually, I speak of my Jr high 
years)
I liked MS, if only b/c it was better than the other Intel solutions
(This is approx 1993 or 1994). When OS/2 came out, I thought it was
a joke (My father had it on his computer, I couldn't even get the calculator
to run).

When Win95 came out, I finally got to hate M$. Then I discovered Linux
and now I have a great dislike for M$ and their products.

I appreciate that as a user you may have a choice. As a tech or MIS/IT, 
I don't have
a choice. As such I believe that I have been "damaged" by M$.
