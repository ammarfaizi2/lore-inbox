I attached the .config.

The setup:

/dev/hda on onboard IDE
/dev/sd{a,b,c,d,e,f} on Adaptec
md0 : active raid5 sdd1[2] sdc1[1] sdb1[0]
md1 : active raid5 sdd2[2] sdc2[1] sdb2[0]
md3 : active raid5 sdd3[2] sdc3[1] sdb3[0]
md2 : active raid1 sdf1[1] sde1[0]

The backup script roughly does the following:
1. mount hda
2. backup data from the md*,sd* devices to hda
3. umount hda

As I said, the IDE drive was on an ATA RAID card at first, visible to
the system as /dev/sdg.  I changed this because of the tainted ATA RAID
module, but I'm receiving the same oops either way.

I double-checked.

Tell me if you need any further information.

Best wishes,
