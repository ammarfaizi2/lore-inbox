I think he means when you contribute to a GNU piece of code?  They ask you 
to sign over your copyright so they can enforce it more easily in court.  

Or so they say.  They could also use this power for evil.  Also, what's up 
with that "GPL version 2 or later" stuff?  I always take that out of my 
licenses.  While I understand that if I die, its then sort of trapped 
under GPL2, I really don't want whoever decides to make the next GPL 
changing the licensing on my program significantly...
