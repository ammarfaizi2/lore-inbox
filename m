I don't want to judge, wether writing docs wastes developer's
time. But, when I first tried understanding file systems, it was of
tremendous help having docs like Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt and
the like. I couldn't have done it without.

When you're that far, you are a developer and it will waste your time
writing docs ;-).
