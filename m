Ah, the austin rumor mill.

According to a friend of mine who works at AMD:

1) Intel licensed that hyper-transport thing when they licensed x86-64 
(Yamhill?).

2) Dell gave people refunds on the few itanium machines they actually managed 
to sell.  (I believe the number I heard was a total of about two hundred and 
fifty total itanium "development" systems sold...)

There would appear to be a distinct trend here, but you know rumors... :)
