You're right, I thought of that after I posted.  What would probably
work best is if someone who was not particularly BK friendly but
is acknowledged as a Linux leader were to step forward and agree to
represent the community interests.  Know anyone like that?  Hint, 
Alan, look in the mirror :)

Then I and this person try and hammer out some sort of compromise.
It's clear from the fuss this causes about every three weeks that people
don't feel safe, on either side.  You're scared that we're going to do
some evil thing and we're scared that you are going to do evil thing.
Maybe it's not possible, but it would be nice if we could, operating in
good faith, work out some sort of agreement that made sense.  Yeah, I
know it isn't binding, that the best you could do on the community side is
have a bunch of people stand up and say "hey, leave BitMover alone, they
are doing a good service" but I'd take that over the current mess any day.
