Tim, in this case you are not just testing the openess idea, you are also 
testing the low-volume, high-cost, but flexible idea. and that idea has 
never had a large market

you are in something of a catch-22 here. due to the risk you can only do 
things with a relativly small initial investment, but with a larger 
initial investment you could make much cheaper (and therefor much more 
popular) cards. where's a billionare looking to Do Good Things (TM) when 
you need one ;-)
