You seem to have changed your mind. Last I heard from you wanted them in as
few large blocks as possible. Now you want them in many small blocks. If you
want it changing, please feel free to supply me with a patch.

No. These belong in the vm_table. It doesn't seem especially straightforward
to do what you want. If you want it doing your way, then feel free to send
Andrew a patch.

Probably. I'll deal with that after Andrew/Linus take my patches, if they take
my patches.

Supply me with a patch and I'll test it. I don't know how the compound-page
stuff works, but it's quite possibly the wrong way to do it. There is no MMU
available, so you can't generate adjacency that way.

> And you ocmpletely ignored the previous comment here aswell.

No, I didn't; you're wrong.

Feel free to supply a patch to change it to what you think is correct. I'll
test it for you.
