So, are we going to take out the appendix in 2.5 or will
we continue hoping our kernel doesn't catch an illness
without actually doing anything preventive ?

Biological selection does nothing except removing the weak

In short, I believe the biological selection is just that,
selection. The creation of stuff will need some direction.
