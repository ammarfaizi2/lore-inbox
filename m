Unless I'm mistaken, the 2.0-pre series of releases was identified
internally as 1.99.x instead. This series of 14 kernels were released
between 12 May 1996 and 6 Jun 1996, and are listed in the quote above.

If I am mistaken and there were indeed a dozen or so kernels released
with 1.99 version numbers between 1.3.100 and 2.0-pre1, they were all
released in the 2 days between those kernels, and I have to state that
I would consider this unlikely, although not impossible.

However, the claim that there were other kernels between 0.01 and 0.10
of which I am not aware, or between 0.12 and 0.95 of which I am also not
aware, would not surprise me in either case. Here is the relevant part
of the history sequence for this period...

>>> 17 Sep 1991  17:29:55          10,239        235,669  0.01
>>>
>>>  3 Dec 1991   1:48:02          13,460        307,481  0.10
>>>  8 Dec 1991  18:37:16          13,839        319,681  0.11
>>> 16 Jan 1992   6:39:10          19,258        446,636  0.12
>>>
>>>  8 Mar 1992  12:04:59          20,882        493,630  0.95
>>> 17 Mar 1992  21:47:55          21,275        503,578  0.95a
>>>  9 Apr 1992  20:48:11          22,147        527,085  0.95c

...and you will note that 11 weeks passed between the 0.01 and 0.10
kernels, and a further 7.5 weeks between the 0.12 and 0.95 kernels.
However, I have been unable to locate any reliable information regarding
the missing kernels, so this is the limit of my knowledge here.

The other period where I suspect missing kernels is this one...

>>> 15 Aug 1993  15:28:14         122,867      3,244,802  0.99.12
>>> 17 Aug 1993  22:39:38         122,871      3,244,979  0.99.12a
>>>
>>> 20 Sep 1993  16:18:01         124,228      3,279,890  0.99.13
>>>
>>> 25 Oct 1993  22:33:27         135,501      3,605,576  0.99.13k
>>>
>>> 29 Nov 1993   9:11:53         157,045      4,180,919  0.99.14
>>>  3 Dec 1993  15:26:49         156,751      4,169,476  0.99.14a

...between the 0.99.12a and 0.99.14 kernel releases. I suspect both that
there were other kernels in each of the three gaps shown above, but have
been unable to find any reliable information regarding them. Personally,
I would anticipate full alphabets for both the 0.99.12 and 0.99.13
subseries as occurs with the 0.99.14 subseries, but can't prove it.

As far as I am aware, the collection of available kernels from 0.99.14
to date is complete, and it is only these five gaps where kernels are
missing. ANY information regarding any of the missing kernels would be
much appreciated, and actual tarballs for ANY of these would be a bonus.

Best wishes from Riley.
