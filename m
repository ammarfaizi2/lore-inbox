I sent a 3 testing patches designated [TESTING-PATCH] to lkml and cc'd
to you, but someone else told me they didn't see it on lkml so i probably
was experiencing mail problems. I've got it on a desktop and an old
Toshiba laptop and doesn't blow up either ;) (yet?)

Sure i'd be glad to i don't think that many people have such archaic
hardware anymore but i find it hard to let go ;)
