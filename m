I just had an Idea...

What about deciding a comenting format where functions are declared.

This would be used by a parser that after each release, creates an API 
documnet on kernel.org. I think that the format Sun uses for their online 
API for Java is great, and if this was compleatly autometed, well not much 
maintainer work...
