It's likely an SMM event, which Linux doesn't even get to see.
The BIOS handles it appropriately. The chipset has a bit you can
flip to disable this 'feature', but there was a caveat iirc, something
like 'it turns itself back on every so often'.  I'll let Egbert say
more about it, as he had the relevant datasheet.
