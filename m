Definitely agreed.

When I am forced to sign NDAs to get hardware specs, the hardware IP 
"revealed" is inevitably something that some other company has done 
before, and done better.  NDAs and closed specs are IMO only used by 
vendors to save face, when their hardware design is stupid, and their 
errata innumerable.
