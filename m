:-)

Perhaps a more convincing argument may be that in embedded devices,
disk as well as memory and CPU power are _not_ cheap.

The more resources Linux requires, the less are it's chances of being
accepted as a viable alternative in embedded systems.

That would be _a_ _lot_ for an embedded system!
