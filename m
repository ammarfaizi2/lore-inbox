Subject says it all...

The patch is the driver portion for the Mwave applied against the 2.4.4
kernel proper..

It was a little big to send directly to the list..  So...  You'll be able
to pick it up at http://www.ibm.com/linux/ltc/ shortly..  Until it goes up
there, it will be available at http://www.haywired.net/MWAVE/...

Please throw any comments, questions, suggestions, hard objects this way...

Cheers...Paul...
