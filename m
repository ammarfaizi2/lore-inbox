Then the kernel community is no longer fit to use my code. So you should
remove everything I've written from Linus kernel too. I'll maintain my
own kernel.

Oh gosh, look I've just crippled Linus tree and stolen his project.
Thats *WHY* you can't just rip drivers out. A license was granted, for
ever. You can certainly remove him from maintainers, and if he insists
from the author credits.
