The third maintenance release of the 15th version of the reverse
mapping based VM is now available.
This is an attempt at making a more robust and flexible VM
subsystem, while cleaning up a lot of code at the same time.
The patch is available from:

           http://surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.20-rmap15c
and        http://linuxvm.bkbits.net/

  - fix it again in the morning                           (me)
  - add #ifdef BROKEN_PPC_PTE_ALLOC_ONE to rmap.h, it
    seems PPC calls pte_alloc() before mem_map[] init     (me)

    to be a stupid bug in page_launder_zone()             (me)

  - improve comments all over the place                   (Michael Cohen)
  - don't panic if page_remove_rmap() cannot find the
    rmap in question, it's possible that the memory was
    PG_reserved and belonging to a driver, but the driver
    exited and cleared the PG_reserved bit                (me)
  - fix the VM livelock by replacing > by >= in a few
    critical places in the pageout code                   (me)
  - treat the reclaiming of an inactive_clean page like
    allocating a new page, calling try_to_free_pages()

    doing swapin_readahead                                (me)

    vmscan.c for cosmetic purposes                        (William Lee Irwin)
  - move page_address() to architecture-independent
    code, now the removal of page->virtual is portable    (William Lee Irwin)
  - speed up free_area_init_core() by doing a single
    pass over the pages and not using atomic ops          (William Lee Irwin)
  - documented the buddy allocator in page_alloc.c        (William Lee Irwin)

  - add rmap.h for other archs (untested, not for ARM)    (me)
rmap 6:
  - make the active and inactive_dirty list per zone,
    this is finally possible because we can free pages
    based on their physical address                       (William Lee Irwin)
  - cleaned up William's code a bit                       (me)

  - add back inactive_target to /proc/meminfo             (me)
rmap 5:
  - fixed recursive buglet, introduced by directly
    editing the patch for making rmap 4 ;)))              (me)
rmap 4:
  - look at the referenced bits in page tables            (me)
rmap 3:
  - forgot one FASTCALL definition                        (me)
rmap 2:
  - teach try_to_unmap_one() about mremap()               (me)
  - don't assign swap space to pages with buffers         (me)
  - make the rmap.c functions FASTCALL / inline           (me)
