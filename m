Best example is IBM. It's only possible to install the DB2 client
in your native Language (may be German) on Windows. The manual's are
in English. So, for example a trigger is a Auslöser - very strange.
May be they should translate the SQL Language to. Would be a little
bit easier and I can start with computing from scratch again.

Another nice thing is Excel. You use German for the table and English
for VB programing. For example: table: zeichen() == VB char().

On the other hand, the only population who dubbed/translate every
movie/thing into German, are the German's. Most others (for example Scandinavia,
Netherland) use the original Language (mostly English) with subtitles.
