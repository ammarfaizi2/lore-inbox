I've always made sure I had paperwork from my employer permitting it,
and I've never had any problems getting that. Most of the time before
Red Hat I was working for companies that were small (so had a low idiot
ratio) or for companies were while I worked in computing it wasn't
directly related (eg as a sysadmin/network engineer). 

Obviously if you are employed to hack OS internals don't be suprised if
the employer says "no", most however seem reasonable or will agree they
have no problem with contributions that don't relate to their business
area. (So they dont see you as taking things you learned through your
employment and 'leaking' knowledge to the outside world.
