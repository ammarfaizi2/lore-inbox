None of the mails reporting that inserting a header in any file has 
produced a build here that actually gets rid of the build error.  I have 
the same errors about implicit declarations of ack_APIC_irq that i had 
before i added asm/io_apic.h to irq.c in arch/i386/kernel and before i 
added it to include/asm/hardirq.h.   I've attached my .config to see if 
anyone realizes what i'm doing wrong or what's not being defined 
correctly. thanks.
