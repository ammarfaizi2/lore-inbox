Once you've finished learning BASIC, unlearn all the crap you won't need for
Pascal.

Also, add Python for good programming style (or replace BASIC and Pascal
with it entirely if you're feeling brave) and some sort of FP to sharpen your
pure algorithmic skills. If you don't want to go into full-fledged Lisp, then
take a look at XSLT.

PHP is good if you're going to do anything web-oriented, but it's very similar
to C, so...

Also, Perl doesn't hurt, but I've found that it isn't entirely neccessary if
you can deal with sed and awk, which I also suggest you pick up.
