What's the current status of the loop-# patch? Haven't seen anything 
since loop-4, which doesn't apply clean to 2.4.1-ac14 (one hunk is 
rejected in loop.c, many others apply with fuzz).

I am waiting in anticipation of the folding of this patch into the 
mainline kernel.

IIRC, Jens said he was working on a loop-5, but that was a week or two ago.
