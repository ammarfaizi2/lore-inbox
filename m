I would also like to help with development of the 2.5 kernel, we could

Subject: I want to help with 2.5

Hi,

I would like to make a meaningful contribution to the 2.5 kernel, so I'm

wondering if anyone out there would like my help.  I would prefer to 
work on a component where I could do the majority of the work, rather 
than just help out with something massive.  Is there a particular piece 
of hardware that needs a device driver that no one is working on?  Is 
there some kernel enhancement that no one has gotten around too but 
would be a good addition?  Please post or email your suggestion!
Thanks!
