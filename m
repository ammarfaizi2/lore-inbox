Greetings,

OJFS is a general-purpose, Online Journaling File
system based on  ReiserFS which was designed and
implemented by a team at Namesys led by Hans  Reiser,
who is referred to as the project's Benevolent
Dictator for Life (and death). It is currently
supported for GNU/Linux and may be included in other
operating systems in the future.

You may download the patch for the 2.6.18 kernel at 
http://www.sendspace.com/file/9zb2gf

Or view our Wikipedia page for more up to date
information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OJFS

We encourage all current ReiserFS users to upgrade to
OJFS for improved performance due our extensive
cleanups of object naming overhead.

Thank you,
The OJFS Team (AYBABTU).
