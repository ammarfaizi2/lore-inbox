   Ted, your mail-archives are incomplete: in linux-activists/Volume6
   you have digests 200-298 and 365-371, and there are no 299-364.

Oops.  I'm not sure what happened there.  I must have forgotten to move
things off of the news server.  I doubt anyone still has the old
digests, but if anyone does have Volume 6 nos. 299-364, please let me
know. 

   Digest 298 is about Fri, 8 Oct 93, while Alan's stuff starts
   Wed, 13 Oct 1993. So, a few days are missing.

   But then, your digests 365-371 should show overlap with Alan's stuff,
   where you both have the period 10-12 Nov 93, and I find no such overlap.
   So, Ted has old Linux-Activists@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU stuff,
   and Alan has owner-linux-activists%fi.hut.cs.joker@fi.hut.FINHUTC stuff,
   and at first sight these look disjoint.

Yes, they're different.  My linux-activists archives start in Jan '92,
when the joker.cs.hut.fi list was starting to melt down, and so we moved
things to alt.os.linux, with a mail/news gateway which I ran on
bloom-beacon.mit.edu (and later on senator-bedfellow.mit.edu).

Sometime during '92, the joker.cs.hut.fi lists got redone so they could
support multiple "channels" (for kernel, net, scsi, et.al discussions)
and to support greater bandwidth, and so the hard-core kernel
discussions started migrating back to the mailing list.  Of course,
still later the joker lists got moved to rutgers.  Matti, want to
comment more about the history here?

Volume0 of my archives contain my 91-92 archives of the joker.cs.hut.fi
list.  Volume1 begins the archive of the alt.os.linux archive, and after
comp.os.linux was created, everything was moved from alt.os.linux to
comp.os.linux.  This happened starting at Volume 2 of the
linux-activists archives.

Here's the first message from Volume1 of my archives, which some folks
might find of historical interest.
