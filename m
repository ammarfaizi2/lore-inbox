I have backported the driver as suggested from 2.6 to 2.4 but that
didn't help. I then got a fedora core 3 installation on a separate hard
drive with kernel 2.6.9-1.667. the one thing that i found that is
peculiar and looks like a bug is that the /usr/include/watchdog.h is not
the same as the watchdog.h in the src directory. In any case even after
copying the the header file across i was unable to get the watchdog to
reset the OS. Is there something i am not doing?

Cheers

Ryan
