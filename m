i got a RedHat box which running a 2.2.x kernel.  since its too old, i
decided to upgrade it to 2.6.x, but this might involving upgrading of
gcc, libc and lots of other things.  i don't want to bother to do that
and think i can build a kernel in another newer system (a slackware
running 2.6.x) and copy needed stuff over to the old box.  is it
possible?  if so, what stuff i have to copy from the newer box to the
old box? what i can imaged by far are: the bzImage file, the
/lib/modules/2.6.x directory.  are there still other things?

thanks in advance.
