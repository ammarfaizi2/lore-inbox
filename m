Hello,
    Recent install of Redhat9 on a machine with an Athalon 1 ghz A7A266
motherboard. I'm getting a very persistent message in my syslog:
"Kernel: i8253 count too high! Resetting..."
    A google search pointed me here, indicating that this was a known
problem, but i didn't see a fix. Has anyone seen this error and if so what
do i do about it?
Thanks.
Dave.
