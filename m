apples? pears?

100% copy or "binary clone" of a software is illegal, thats correct.

Reimplementing the "ideas" behind a software is legal.

Otherweise there wouldn't be Bitkeeper. "100% original invention" is
impossibel today. At least for a "nontrivial" software. And i guess
Bitkeeper isn't "trivial" (-> it's more than a oneliner).
