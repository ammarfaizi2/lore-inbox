There is a third, actually:

3.  Abandon running mailing lists in the E.U., and let them be run in
the other countries that don't have these sorts of insane laws.

"The Net interprets censorship as damage, and routes around it."

P.S.  Not that I think that concept of data protection is a bad thing,
but if it prevents open mailing lists --- if posting to a list isn't
considered an implicit permission to redistribute the mail and have it
be archived --- something is badly, badly, badly wrong.
