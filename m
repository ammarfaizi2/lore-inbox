Subject: Abit VP6 HPT370 support?

Does Linux 2.4pre support the raid controller on the abit vp6? The kernel
says it supports the 370, but it doesn't mention raid. I was confused as
to if there was a difference or not.

Also, OT, does anyone know if the controller is managed through hardware
or through software?

Thanks.
