Not a big contributor here, but the first thing I thought when I saw the 
message was root kit. Granted you may have to be 'good' to root the box, 
or to know that it is present in the corp network. However, you did say 
it is forwarding mail which means it receives mail, thus it has an 
identifiable and locatable IP address. Also, it was stated that it was a 
generic RH running 2.4.18 (I think) and no hacking done to it. Is it 
kept up  to date, current libraries etc... From what you said it sounds 
like a rarely thought of recipient of internet services (e-mail) or what 
some like to call "a target of opportunity"
