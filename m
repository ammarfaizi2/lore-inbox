Hello,

The "Latest Stable Kernel" on the main page of www.kernel.org is 2.6.11.2 and 
this is of course right.

But people who want to apply an -rc patch, or some other patchsets (e.g. -ck) 
want 2.6.11. They can currently get it only by browsing directories.

Perhaps, to enable easier usage of such patchsets, a "latest Base kernel link" 
should be added to the kernel.org main page? This would be the latest three 
point release. Of course it should be below "stable", as "stable" is the 
default choice.

Yours, Mikhail Ramendik
