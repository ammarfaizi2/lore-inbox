Isn't this a distraction that comes up about once a year?  Someone 
bitching about the comments in the kernel source...

Turns out the Microsoft code has just as much profanity, if not more, than

I am more concerned about how Linus is going to keep working now that he 
is moving to someplace with good beer.
