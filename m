gpg.  Was in my upload script to begin with.  I keep my key written many
times on a single hidden CD.  So long as the isofs can be read, at least
one of the copies should be usable.

They don't have any billing information on me.  If they charge me for
something, I'll cancel my account.

They are giving you unlimited storage for free.  Even with all of that,
it's a damn good deal.

I don't have several hundred gigabytes of dynamic data, and neither does
the average desktop user.  The several hundred gigabytes of static data
I have would be backed up on DVDs anyway.

Now, if we're talking about a sysadmin, then of course you need a better
backup solution -- no matter what FS you use.
