But seriously, I don't have the idea that there is any
university program which really prepares you for being
a kernel hacker.

At university, you will learn things like thinking in
a logically coherent way, proving that that your idea
was right, understanding exactly why your neat idea
was right and the ability to explain all of this to
others.

Oh, you might also learn things like C, physics,
math, molecular biology, philosophy or other in-depth
technical things. Which of these isn't too important,
just make sure you get the interesting ones ;)

Now, about preparing yourself to be a kernel hacker;
the only thing which really helps for that is to start
learning about the kernel and to start playing around
with making small changes to those parts of the kernel
you think are interesting.

The people at the Kernelnewbies project may have some info:
