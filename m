/"Red Hat has slammed the door shut 
<http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2059675,00.asp> on any possibility 
of entering into a patent protection deal similar to the one Microsoft 
recently announced with Novell, eWeek is reporting. While Microsoft has 
repeatedly said it wants to work with Red Hat and would like to 
structure a relationship where its customers can be assured of the same 
thing as Novell's customers 
<http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/06/11/02/1957252.shtml?tid=109> now 
are, Mark Webbink, Red Hat's deputy general counsel, says 'we do not 
believe there is a need for or basis for the type of relationship 
defined in the Microsoft-Novell announcement.' Interestingly enough, 
Microsoft also says that it has not ruled out going it alone and 
providing some sort of indemnification for its customers who also use 
Red Hat Linux."/

"Meanwhile, Eben Moglen, the FSF general counsel, promises that GPLv3 
will explicitly outlaw 
<http://money.cnn.com/blogs/legalpad/2006/11/is-microsoft-novell-deal-dead-on.html> 
deals like this. (Of course everyone's on v2, so calling the Novell deal 
"DOA" would be premature.)"

So when is the kernel moving to GPLv3?   I have seen some discussions 
about moving off v2, is there concensus about moving to v3 to remove
threats of patent claims against v2 code by M$ and others who may use 
Linux in hardware based projects.
