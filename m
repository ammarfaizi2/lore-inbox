IANAL, but in many coutries the fact that you didn't know is not an
excuse. When you integrate alien parts in your products you become

What's so neat in grabbing a bunch GPL protected software and stoking it
inside a ROM, clearly breaking the license ? Maybe they got only half part
of the communism thingy, "What is your is also mine and what is mine is
just mine".
