If she installed Linux herself, today, then she's not Aunt Tillie.  She's "my
Aunt Tillie who's something of a computer hobbyist, and not afraid to install
a Unix-like OS on her PC alongside (or instead of) Windows".  That's a _whole_
different ballgame -- and if she can do that, then she's fully capable of
reading a little bit and answering some yes/no questions to compile a kernel.

Sure I can -- the same way I know that Ma & Pa Kettle are never going to use
their computer for more than email, web surfing, and playing Solitaire.

No, my beliefs are based on twenty years of observing people using computers
and technoogy.  I have yet to see a single person who is simultaneously (i)
technical enough to need something from their kernel that their distribution
vendor doesn't provide, and (ii) not technical enough to be able to compile it
themselves with today's tools.

I think your auto-configurator will be something of a white elephant --
equivalent to a better guide for setting the clock in your VCR.  Those people
who can't figure out how to set their VCR clock from the current instructions
are the same people who don't care whether it flashes "12:00" or not.
