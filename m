Hi Andrew,

I get a crash in ACPI every time I try to boot with it enabled.  I don't
remember which kernel it stopped working in, but it was fairly recently:
perhaps 2.5.68 or 69.

My hardware is an IBM ThinkPad X31; .config attached, and a dmesg output
with acpi=off on the command line.  I briefly see lots of "....." being
printed before the oops happens.  It is in interrupt context ("trying to
kill swapper"), so it hangs after the crash.

I had to type the crash by hand; I don't have a serial port on this
laptop.

[scrolled off screen, so I don't know what the actual oops was, but I
suspect NULL pointer indirection]
eax=edx=0x5a5a5a5a
ecx=esi=edi=0x0
esp=dff058b8

Is there any other info you need?

Thanks,
