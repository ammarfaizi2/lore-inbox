The subject just about says it.
What versions of 2.4.x and 2.5.x compile cleanly with
the new gcc 3.2 that is included in most recent releases
(in particular RH8.0)

The 2.4.18-14 kernel sources from RH have LOTS of patches,
and they (well the modules) still dont compile with their
own config file (sigh).
