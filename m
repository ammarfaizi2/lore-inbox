Comparing performances between kernel versions, I can feel a
huge overall perfs degradation on the IDE disk. What seems
fast (or "normal") on a 2.4.21 gets clearly slow on a 2.6t2
kernel; -mm1 seems worse to me than 2.6t2 vanilla.

I've done a very stupid test on my notebook: I've repeated
exactly the same sequence of operations on a 2.4 and a
2.6t2/mm1, as root: starting an application requires libs
loading, config reading etc, loading KDE apps makes it
doubled :)

                		2.4.22-pre7  2.6.0t2-mm1  2.6.0t2
[reboot]
KDE startup    		  50 	       67           45
Opening home folder  	   5           30           25
Opening www.kernel.org	   9 	       35           30
Opening a konsole	   2 	       22            9
Opening a 2nd konsole	  <1           12           12
Opening GnuCash		  22 	       50           45
Back to console...

Here attached the .config for both 2.4 and 2.5 and lspci output;
hdparm -tT says ~200Mb/~22Mb on both kernels.

Is there something I'm missing?!
