Hi,

So _why_ the freebox act _differently_ in the boot process when there is 
a firmware update ?
Just for the fun ?

I provide facts and arguments, you provide nothing.

So what about _my_ wifi pcmcia card ?
What about the people who had to paid 400 euros and receive a letter
from free telling them that according to CGV there are the onwer of the
freebox (ok this one need some checks).

Again in my first post I provide facts for this (with links), you provide 
nothing than replying always the same things without arguments against
mine.


Please take my first post and reply to point A, B, C with arguments.

>'Got it, now ?
No, because you didn't answer to my questions...
