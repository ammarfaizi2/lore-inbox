Announcements regarding kernel tools seem relevant, as is any other tool 
change which might affect the kernel creation, maintenence, compilation 
or install. Considering the amount of stuff virtually everyone reads 
past in this list, reports on features not of interest or 2.4 kernels no 
longer used, why did you single out this short and informational message 
as worthy of comment?

I personally have a folder of release announcements, even for things I 
don't use, just so I can find them quickly if my interest or business 
needs change. I wish there was a single release announcements list, but 
there isn't, let's keep useful information HERE!
