... and this one appears to have a terminal flaw. Using complaints without  
verification to automatically list someone is a bad idea for *exactly* the  
same reason that running an open relay is a bad idea - you are at the  
mercy of good behaviour of third parties, and if they don't innocents  
elsewhere suffer.

Or in other words, spamcop seems to be part of the problem, not part of  
the solution.
