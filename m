Are you interested only in the performance of your own computer, or do 
you have any interest in the performance of other people's computers as 
well?

If there's a bug, there's a bug, and you've identified it.  Contrary to 
the attitude of our friends in Redmond, the open source community tends 
to see bugs as being really evil.  If you've found a bug, we want to 
investigate it and fix it.
