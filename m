The above argument is not valid for entries in a revision history. 
Most likely (though not necessarily), when there are multiple entries in a 
revision history with different email addresses, some are going to 
contain obsolete parts.

Besides, I am sure there are thousands of stale email addresses throughout 
the current kernel source tree (and there have always been such) --- why 
start with me? Start with the top --- Linus Torvalds :) Try finding an 
obsolete email address for him in the kernel. By 2030 my turn may come :)

Kind regards
Tigran
