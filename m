Subject: radeonfb: compiles now, but does it work?

Hello,

I was happy to see that from the latest fbdev fixes the radeonfb now compiles.
So I decided to give it another try using 2.5.53-bk7 and even though it compiles
just fine it doesn't seem to be working the way it's supposed to. Here's what I
get upon boot, quoting from dmesg:

radeonfb_pci_register BEGIN
radeonfb: ref_clk=2700, ref_div=12, xclk=18300 from BIOS
radeonfb: probed DDR SGRAM 32768k videoram
radeon_get_moninfo: bios 4 scratch = 1000004
radeonfb: panel ID string: Samsung LTN150P1-L02    
radeonfb: detected DFP panel size from BIOS: 1400x1050
radeonfb: ATI Radeon M7 LW DDR SGRAM 32 MB
radeonfb: DVI port LCD monitor connected
radeonfb: CRT port no monitor connected
radeonfb_pci_register END

It seems all fine and dandy but it doesn't actually display things correctly
like it does on, say, 2.4.20. If I use vga=794 for instance, it doesn't even
show anything even though boot processing continues in the background. If I
compile with CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=n then I just get the regular console with no
framebuffer whatsoever (i'd say the equivalent to vga=normal).

So, is the radeonfb actually working and something's up with my .config or
should I wait a bit longer? 8)

My .config follows.
