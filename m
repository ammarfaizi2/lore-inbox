I'm glad someone here mentioned this problem (Athlon freezing up at 
varying times during use of GUI).  I was beginning to think everyone but 
me already discovered the fix.

If some information I can provide someone here would help, please let me
know.  And conversely.

If there's a better mailing list for this topic, I'd love to know about 
it.


Thanks much,
kf
