This seems to be the realm of the "user does the link" and "user does
the patch" discussions from many years ago on gnu.misc.discuss.

Clarity wasn't forthcoming then, either.

(Personally I suspect it would be a long and complicated argument in
court, questioning awkward things like intent of the law, intent of
the authors, quid pro quo and other considerations if the parties were
willing to pursue it all the way.  But I know very little about law!)
