This patent was filed on August 22, 2001. If this is after the code came 
into public existence this would constitute prior art and hence invalidate 
the patent... Of course I have no idea when the code you pointed out was 
released...

In either case, software patents are not allowed in the European Union 
(yet), so we would just need to have an european kernel... (-;

Best regards,

         Anton
