I can understand a rejection; I mean, last year there was already a BOF
about the topic, which makes the "newness" of the talk less. In weighing
the undoubtedly very many proposals, the OLS committee needs to make
hard choices obviously; and I can see the point of preferring new talks
over talks which cover a topic that was discussed the year before.

that to me doesn't sound like a conspiracy, but just running a
conference sanely.
