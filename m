Depends on how much money you have to offer.  If you have the resources 
to hire
a programmer full-time until your favourite problem is solved - no 
problem I think.

If funding development alone is a bit much, consider starting with one
particular problem and try collecting money from other interested
people. 

Money can surely get the work done - but then you usually have to pay
enough that the programmer can make a living while working for you.
The cheap alternative is enthusiasts who will write a hardware driver if 
they get
the hw for free.
