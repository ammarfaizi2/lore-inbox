I don't believe you can 100% reliably achieve 100uS on an x86 board just
because of the possible SMM, cache and tlb miss worse cases combined
with the IRQ latency of the hardware. If you have other PCI devices on
the bus then you will have real fun getting hear it.

Hand tuning all the configuration and using rtlinux as the bottom layer
might just about do it if you avoided other PCI devices that can be slow
to respond (eg ATA disk and many video cards). You'll also need a board
with no SMM mode code in use so probably ACPI disabled, and possibly
have to pick the board to suit the needs.

It may also be far easier to hit such deadlines if the chip is wired
fairly directly to one of the embedded processors so you don't have
busses in the way and you have a fast IRQ response.

The other highly latency sensitive stuff like that I've seen appears to
all bus master and have a FIFO to front that which just handles PCI
delays. That way an IRQ just means one of the bus master buffers is
full.
