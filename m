Not if you recompile.

Why (It's DVB by the way)? It's as close to the kernel as ls or cat
and having two sets of the same includes is stupid.

What packages? You are always talking about packages. There are no packages.
There are only the kernel and my app. Nothing else. No copying of headers.

There is no one who does that, not even distributions. The includes
needed for libc are far less prone to change than v4l or dvb. And not
as linux specific.

I see your point, but right now it's only academic and not practicable.
