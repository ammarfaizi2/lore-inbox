Wrong.  The GPL does not in any way take away your *freedom to share*.
It does take away your freedom to *restrict* though, it limits your freedom
to *prevent others from sharing*.

What problem could you possibly have with that?  Licences are simple -
don't like them, don't use the product.  Why complain about it?

I don't like licences where I have to pay *money* just to get some software.
Expensive, and a waste if I end up not using that sw much.
So I try to avoid that kind when possible.  Fortunately, that is 
possible almost
all the time for me.

Now, if you don't like the GPL - don't use any GPL-licenced products then!
Why nag about it?  I don't bitch about how the "pay" licences limits my
business opportunities. (I cannot possibly afford to buy
every payware program.) In particular, I cannot sell PCs containing lots
of pay-licences software without actually _paying_, thereby driving up
the price.  But complaining about that would be silly.

The same applies to you.  If you want to include GPL stuff in a product,
then your product goes GPL too.  That is the _price_ for GPL code.  If that
price is too high for you, don't use GPL code then!  That should
be fine with you, and fine with us.  But again - complaining about it is 
silly.

Well, write your own better licence then, and use it!  Then you'll have the
satisfaction of seeing others use your code in their proprietary products.
Nobody stops you from doing that.
