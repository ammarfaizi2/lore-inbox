While not 100% accurate, kernelnewbies.org has done a very good job of 
tracking changes and pending changes during the 2.5 development life-cycle.  
I'm sure with another pair of eyes, they might be able to fully cover every 
potential development in a kernel's lifecycle.

*SIGH* This makes me nostalgic for Jim Pick's kernelnotes.org, a shame he 
didn't have time to maintain it anymore.

Cheers,
Nicholas
