Hello.

I've been running 2.4.5 on a Dell notebook for some time,
with good-ish stability.
When I upgraded it to 2.4.9, I noticed that it would
become hotter than before.
I don't know what could cause this. Maybe it's intended,
or maybe it's just a symptom of kapm-idled not being as
effective as before for whatever reason.
