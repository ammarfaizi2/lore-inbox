Don't know off hand Dr. Con, but I'll sure keep an eye on it.  Mail, 
including spam, seems to be flowing at the usual pace though, but thats

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
