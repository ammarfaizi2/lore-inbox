Everyone,

I would very much appreciate comments (even one-liners) on any  
community interest in these two OLS Performance BoF sessions.  I  
believe the topics are dissimilar and relevant enough to justify both:
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
-------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL FOR LINUX BENCHMARK AUTOMATION
This BOF will include a discussion on Linux benchmark automation. We  
will discuss the features needed to provide an effective benchmark  
automation process for Linux. This will include, defining the  
configuration, input files, benchmark execution, output files, etc.  We  
will also discuss the types of benchmarks that are tailored for rapid  
execution and results analysis, for maximum development impact.

PROPOSAL FOR LINUX PERFORMANCE
Linux changes occur very quickly in the open source community. There is  
a strong need to quickly collect and share performance data and  
analysis. However, there may be some instances where good, quality  
performance data collection and analysis take longer than the short  
turnaround required for maximum impact regarding newly released  
patches. We plan to discuss the most effective methodology for  
impacting Linux performance in a rapidly changing Linux open source  
community environment.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
---------------------------------------------
Please reply immediately so we can quickly submit them to OLS?
Thanks for your (speedy) replies!
