Would it not be more productive to have a one-line notice with a 
tech-note number or reference to real documentation?  Then the user can 
type "man gplonly" or "less /usr/src/linux/Documentation/gplonly.txt" 
for the real scoop on all of the error possibilities.

Mind you, on this list, it could be just as controversial picking a
name for the text file.
