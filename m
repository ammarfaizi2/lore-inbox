The lawsuit has nothing to do with Caldera or SCO-Linux. It's to make money.
The SCO-People seem to have read the book "How to make money while doing 
nothing" ;-)

That maybe right, I've never used AIX. But one single line of code would be 
enough for SCO. And I think there maybe some more than one line. Surely is it 
old code. But they say it's owned by IBM.
I hope that one day jugdes will stop companies and people from making money 
that dark way. But I think that this hope is slightly irrealistic.
