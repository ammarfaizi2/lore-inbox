HI

I'm running redhat 9 on an XP 1800 and a ASUS A7A266. I recently buy a new 
HD a maxtor Diamond Plus 160 with 8 mega cache. The fact is that the kernel that comes 
with REDHAT (2.4.20-8) shows the entire size of the disk (163.7 gb) but 
the kernel 2.6.1 or 2.6.3 does not. It only shows 137 gb. I'm getting 
crazy trying to understand why this is happening! Please let 
me know if theres a patch to fix this. I really  found amazing the 2.6 
kernel and i don't want to come back to use the 2.4!
What can i do? 

p.s. let know if you need more info about my system


Regards

Carlo Orecchia
