I not only highly respect Rusty but have closely worked and been 
friends with him for several years. The same applies to several other 
kernel developers.

Please don't get me wrong. We are entirely for the open-source nature 
of Linux, and I have been personally contributing for the last 15 years 
to many open-source projects (for examples, see the AUTHORS section of 
"man iptables", or search google for my previous email addresses 
marc@mbsi.ca & marc@cam.org to get more historical background).

However we also believe that pragmatically bringing in support for key 
hardware (which currently cannot otherwise be easily handled in the 
traditional open-source approach) will benefit Linux, help it gain even 
more usefulness/acceptance, and make larger numbers of exposed people 
realize the natural advantages of open-source, then become 
contributors. On the other hand, forcing open-source down throats with 
impractical "tainting" schemes, scare tactics or other coercive methods 
may achieve the opposite effect or turn Linux into just an 
ideological/political movement rather than the ubiquitous operating 
system it deserves to be.

Sincerely
Marc
