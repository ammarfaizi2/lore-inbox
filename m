Okay. Does the word *choice* ring a bell ? Agenda VR3s are supplied with Li=
nux
kernel (modified), and it gives you the freedom to choose what kind of SW
you want to use -- hey, it's linux and when the app fits in the memory,
there's no stopping you. Different look and feel? Different graffitti? Diff=
erent
kernel? You name it and you got it (well mostly) ;-)
