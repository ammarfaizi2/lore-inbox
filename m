Subject: admin: vger cannot be reached

This is a plea for help from the list admins and more
specifically for the people taking care of vger.kernel.org.

I am unable to access vger.kernel.org during the last days.
My ISP provided the following explanation (rough translation):

--- snip ---
Redhat thinks it is a good idea to announce 66.187.232.0/20
as a /24 network. This is considered against the policy of 
ARIN/RIPE and such announcements are filtered by most major 
ISPs as a protection measure of their routers against 
misconfiguration and also reduces the size of the routing tables.
Redhat (more specifically vger) is likely not reachable from 
different parts of the world until they change this. Here C&W 
and ECRC are enforcing this.
--- snip ---

Could anyone have a look at this?

Thanks
Michael
