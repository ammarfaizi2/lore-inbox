I can agree that target based OSes are becoming popular these days, and 
leading companies try to build an optimized, task specific OS for their 
particular hardware and need.

But, if you're implying that we can start once again from bottom, and come up 
with something better that unix (which has been opensource, around for long 
while, tested and developed by many as well) I _HIGHLY_ doubt, and disagree. 
This is unless main kernel developers *confess* that some incorrect design 
decisions were made at the start (at a major section or so), which now 
they're forced to comply with, and let such bugs traverse through kernel 
versions, and there is no way to remove them, unless start from scratch 
again.

I doubt there be any such errors (mistakes) if ANY. but then, i'm not a kernel 
developer, and new to this whole mailing list !!
