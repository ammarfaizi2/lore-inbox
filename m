That problem is understood and is why my patch which changed "its" to
"it's" used "it is" in the two files where that was an issue.  One was
a .c file with in-line assembly.

Better for some.

I can certainly back off on these fixes or do it the way you suggest if
it's causing people any grief. Your request is the second in this area
and being an impediment to progress is the opposite of my intention.

If "the patches" in the above are my patches, then that's my problem.
If "the patches" in the above are yours and others patches, then the
problem is more generic.  These typo fixes have a fairly low intrinsic
value, but the issue you raise is important.  

I've seen several instances where real fixes have gotten integrated,
only to be inadvertently backed out by a subsequent unrelated patch to
the same file from another maintainer who had not recently resynced his
tree with Linus.  A generic solution to that problem would have
considerable value.  If we all used Bitkeeper, maybe we wouldn't have
these prob...(just kidding about BK, no flames please).
