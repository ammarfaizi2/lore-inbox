I'm not talking about abstracting much of anything, just moving
(arbitration of) actual hardware access to a common lowlevel driver. The
things you mentioned but snipped above, basically.

No need to tell me that...

I still haven't seen a complete logical chain leading to that
conclusion.

The lowlevel driver could provide all the necessary arbitration and
safety measures to prevent the two from stepping on each other's toes.

Again, not me.

Exactly. Why not leave it like that, and the DRM taking care of memory
management and rendering?

Agreed.

Probably true, I'm not talking about a generic interface (although some
parts might be generic, just like the DRM userspace interface).
