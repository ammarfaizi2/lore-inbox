That's about as self-serving a statement as I've ever seen. If this 
'Jim Alchin' actually believes what he's saying, he's got to be one 
of the worlds biggest fools, and if he doesn't believe what he's 
saying, well there aren't too many words that would accurately 
describe what he is. 

It's pretty funny in some ways, e.g. "We can build a better product 
than Linux...", which begs the question, "Well, why don't you?". 
Perhaps it costs too much?
