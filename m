Would you guys *PLEASE* remove your earplugs and get this off lkml?
You have been hinted->told->flamed->insulted and you still don't get it.

Gear the thread towards whatever topics/issues/problems/points you find
important, but please do so somewhere else!  linux-kernel is NOT the place
for such discussions.

Thanks for understanding,
