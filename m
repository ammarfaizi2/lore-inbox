First chunk: replace calls of vfs_permission() with r/o checks +
simple_permission(), _leaving_ vfs_permission() _itself_ _as-is_.

Filesystem code might be calling permission(9) and expecting (broken)
behaviour from its own ->permission().  Switch to uniform behaviour
would break such places, forcing us to compensate there.  And analysis
won't be fun.

fs code calling permission() is basically equivalent to direct call.

Yes, I have read it.  Try to read the reply - what I'm saying is that it
should be a separate chunk in the series _and_ it will need some preparations
before it can go in.

Once the checks are moved up, we split them into pairs (want_write_access(),
drop_write_access()) where the former can fail.  Then the second call gets
moved past the call of fs method.  IOW, we go from

	start fs activity
	deep in the bowels of fs code check for r/o and possibly fail
	do the rest

to
	check for r/o and possibly fail
	do fs work

_and_ to

	request write access and possibly fail
	do fs work
	drop write access

Transition between (2) and (3) is simple and relatively easy to verify
_IF_ the checks are lifted up.  And result will give sane protection
for remount - switch to r/o would have to be atomic wrt requesting
write access and would fail if we had writers.

Note that per-mountpoint r/o will take pretty much the same amount of work -
propagating vfsmounts down to the IS_RDONLY checks only to have that reverted
when we lift the checks up would mean doing more or less the same twice.

It can be done and it can be merged gradually in small and simple chunks,
so that they could be (a) well-understood and (b) well-tested.

The way we split the series *does* matter - composition of these patches
will be large and will touch quite a few places (there's extra fun with
delayed writes - e.g. removal of last link in foo_unlink() will mean
extra request for write access, dropped when inode is finally deleted,
possibly hours after unlink(2) had returned).  Doing that in one or even
3-4 patches would be insane even in 2.7; in 2.6 it's so out of question
that it's not even funny.
