We have been able to bring ftp.kernel.org back to life, as well as
most auxilliary services.  The exception so far is mirrors.kernel.org
which is still down (this was the RAID that died), however, it
currently looks like it might be at least partially rescuable.

The need for additional space remains, though, even if we can bring
the remaining RAID back up online.

Stay tuned...
