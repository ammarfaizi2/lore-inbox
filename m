| | 
| | OK, aside from making me wonder what HIDDEV refers to and why it isn't set,
| | and making it rather non-obvious which drivers are HID Boot Protocol and

| | 
| | With this file in a text editor, searching for string USB_KBD results in the
| | string not being found.
| 
| Let me see if I am understanding this..

| Or are you discussing a bug in the (on-screen) viewable part of a

| 
| If so, I'll confirm that different config front-ends generate different

oops, I mis-diffed the config files, but I'll keep looking since
I think that I've seen something like this before.
