All, IANAL, but:

    #1: take this discussion of this list...

    goto news:comp.software.licensing

    read the FAQ

    if you still have questions send them to mailto:licensing@gnu.org

    if you don't like any of those answers, talk to a lawyer

    be fair, don't steal someone else's work (don't be like Dennis)

    both GPL and LGPL are clear: you change it, you publish source

    if you don't want to publish source, best bet is don't change it,
        just use it the way it is

    you may not have the right to change anything (according to your
        employer): consult a lawyer
