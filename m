Hi all,
 
The exploit found on http://www.securiteam.com/exploits/5NP061P4AW.html
 
Still works on the latest 2.2 that's to say (I Think), 2.2.19
 
How can it be?
 
There are still a lot of machines on the net which use that ker.
 
Thank you for your attenction...
 
P.S.
The exploit works even on the latest kernel (of the 2.2 series, off course), found on
ftp://updates.redhat.com/6.2/en/
 
P.P.S.
I'm trying to follow the ML, but the traffic is too high for me...:-(
So, if you can... could you answer to my address?
 
Thank you,
 
Silvio Mazzaro
