Hi Paul,

I forwarded the message to a Trend Micro based smtp Viruswall
which reported it as the TROJ_MUSIC.B virus.  Trend reports
it as being a non-destructive, low-risk virus that plays a
tune (taps?) when activated.

Even a low-risk virus can be a pain to exorcise, I hope that
no one here was infected.

Regards,
Lew Wolfgang
