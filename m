I think it should be okay to put code I wrote into kernel, and put
GPLed code into kernel when I keep original author's copyright (I
commonly integrate patches from the lists, etc). And I do not want to
deal with U.S. courts (or Afghanistan courts, for that matter).

As far as I can see, in U.S. you can get lawsuit independend of
whether you did anything wrong or not.
