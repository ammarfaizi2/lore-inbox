  I don't see directly any  linux-kernel@**broadcom.com  address
  at the list.  (We do have 64 of  "^linux-kernel@" matching addresses
  in the linux-kernel list, though.)

  There are couple addresses at broadcom.com,  but those addresses have
  a feeling of being individual people.

  Well, I might get similar bounce for this reply, and I could try to
  decode it a bit.  Nevertheless, I don't suggest holding your breath,
  asphyxiation does set in a bit too fast for my abilities to debug
  these things in the usual case ;-)
