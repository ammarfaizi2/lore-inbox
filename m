Hi everybody!
I've a problem with the checkidt utility provided by
Phrack Issue #59, I think.
The checkidt utility is for 2.4.x kernels, supposedly,
but I compiled it under 2.4.20 and it couldn't read
/dev/kmem.
Anyway, I would like to print the IDT on kernel 2.4.20
with checkidt or not.
Any suggestions are welcome.
Regards,


                                          Slack
