It doesn't make any difference if it's useful. It is a de-facto
standard. Therefore, it must exist. It's just like all the stuff
in the C runtime library you never use like bcopy()!

If everybody in the world wanted to get rid of that dumb bit,
you still couldn't do it. It needs to exists for no other reason
than it has existed.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
