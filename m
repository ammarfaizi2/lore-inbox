DRM/DMCA do nothing to address reimplementation (it can't, see all 
previous posts on how it is a LEGAL activity).

In my observation, DRM/DMCA addresses unauthorized audio and video content
copying.

So, if Open Source is all about reimplementation, and DRM/DMCA is about 
"protecting" audio/video content, where is the connection?

Larry, this is the point YOU are missing.
