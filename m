One strange thing that I want to share with all of you is that I
installed two times Red Hat in this notebook during this week, and no
freeze was suffered during the whole installation process, which is a
process that as you know requires almost an hour to complete.

I´m just asking why the kernel doesn´t freeze during the installation
process (which it is supposed to run Linux I suspect :) ) and just
after booting and typing some commands in init 1 mode, it freezes;
quite strange. 

I have downloaded memtest86 v.2.8, and will test tonight.

Thanks for all the help.
Jorge Carminati.
