Careful.

AFAIK, '5x86' (without anything added) is a description for Cyrix/IBM
processors ONLY.
5x86/6x86/6x86MX are _also_ Cyrix names for CPUs.
'MMX' is a registered (!) trademark by Intel Corp., so Cyrix were obliged to
choose another name for the MMX technology (sorta) that they used in their
CPUs. They named it 'MX' and appended this to the name.

Nevertheless, you are right. You do NOT have a K5.

The *correct* name for your processor is 'Am5x86', though, which is a
trademark of AMD, by the way.
