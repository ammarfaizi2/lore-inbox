Tick is the number of timer interrupts that you've collected, which
may or may not be exactly 100Hz.  In fact, after 400 days of operation,
the deviation from true time is likely to be above 1 hour.

Anyway, you don't need the RTC since you can always fall back to the
system clock which is no worse than before.  However, if you do have
an accurate clock source then this is much better than using the tick.

If you use ntpd, then you can simply record the time on a server that
you trust, and use the tick reading at that point in time to deduce
the boot time.
