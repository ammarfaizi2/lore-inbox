Why would anyone do that. Debian is a bunch of amateurs true, but
they happen to be a bunch of extremely professional amateurs when it
comes to security.

The problem vendor-sec has is with all the tiny little groups, because
its hard to know if they are going to act securely or not. Now I trust
Russell but thats because I know him, many of the others are hard
choices.

If you get it wrong stuff leaks, take a look at the latest CERT fiasco
