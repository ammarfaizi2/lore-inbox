Dearest Linus,

Coming from one who was at the top of the food chain at Novell, and 
abandoned it, I will tell you that a day will come when you wish you 
hadn't taken this step.  If you leave it, and try to come back, it will 
never be the same.  After all, it's the journey that is it's own reward, 
not the end game.  You are a winner, BTW, whatever path you choose to 
take.  

If you are hell-bent on this path, I nominate Alan Cox.  He's not 
perfect, but he's smart, tough, and has an excellent leadership skills 
and vision.. 

U-na-le-nv-hi  U-da-do-li-s-di     (May the creator bless your steps and 
watch over you)

Do-na-da Go-hv-i (See you around, brother)

Wa-do (Thanks)

Wa-ya Ge-tlv-hv-s-di  (Jeff V. Merkey)
