My guess is Ingo is having lots of fun with
the O(1) scheduler and other kernel stuff
right now - I'd like to see a 2.5 branch of

a bit quickly for that right now....

I'm sure tux is not going away, it was just
yesterday that Alex Kramarov submitted
a patch to provide expires support.

TuX is too good to go away!
