Does it have to be Linux?  If not, there are several systems which are
supposed to be simpler than Linux and pedagogically interesting.  For
example, VSTa (see on <URL: http://www.vsta.org/ >).  It's GPL'ed.

Also, if you are interested in history, you might have a look at <URL:
http://www.sco.com/offers/ancient.html >: the Santa Cruz Organization
is offering free source licenses for versions 5, 6 and 7 of Unix
(circa 1970).  The entire v7 kernel source code, for example is below
20klines (mostly C, and a bit of PDP-11 assembler), including device
drivers.  You can even find PDP-11 emulators to run the thing and play
with it.  (But you can't redistribute it.)

(If you want something old *and* free-as-in-free-speech, there's ITS.
I don't think anyone was able to make it run on modern machines,
though.  Making a PDP-10 emulator is much harder than for a PDP-11.)

Happy hacking,
