Greetings;

I've been dl'ing and burning cd's and dvd's at a furious rate for 
several days now, looking for a 64 bit distribution that will actually 
boot on this thing, apparently in vain.  i386 stuff works fine.
The kubuntu 'breezy' 5.10 locks up at the ACPI line regardless of what 
kernel options you pass trying to disable it.

The dapper, 6.06, amd64 cd outputs nothing on screen after "Booting the 
kernel".  I let it sit there for 20 minutes while I caught up on some 
email.

Anybody have any clues that might be helpfull here, other than eating 
the restocking fee and stopping the payment on whats turning into a 
POS, and HP, while not stateing so in the warranty, claims if I put ANY 
3rd party stuff on it, the warranty is null and void.  Needless to say 
I would have appreciated being told that before I dropped my card on 
the counter last tuesday.

Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
