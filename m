Hi,

I have an optical ps2 mouse by Typhoon with a resolution of 400dpi. No
matter wether using protocol ps2 or imps2 the mouse cursor is moving very
disrupted (can't find the right word), not fluent at all, also causing key
strikes.
Is this a kernel problem? Can't figure out any other place to look at. gpm
seems ok.

Thanks,
Axel Siebenwirth
