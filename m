That seems very much like expected behavior to me. I would expect kwrite
to start loading the file, and then having pdflush kick in to page out
parts of kwrite, so that it can allocate more memory. Then kwrite will
continue to load until more of it needs to be paged out, at which point
pdflush will engage again, and so on, until the file is loaded.

Of course, I don't know if you may have a gig or so of RAM, but I'm
having trouble believing that a 150 MB file could be kept in cache,
especially given that kwrite allocates at least as much anonymous memory
to hold it internally.

Now, I can't really speak for reiser4, but it doesn't seem too
incredible that it would be flushing page usage or rebalancing some tree
or something like that. As long as it is niced down (I dunno if it
actually is, though...), that shouldn't be a problem.
