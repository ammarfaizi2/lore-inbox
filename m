Not complex enough so that a network boot protocol can't fit on a BIOS 
chip, believe me.

The only wrong assumptions that I see here are yours.

I don't understand why you cannot accept that the Freebox is part of the 
Free network infrastructure and that you are not using directly the OS 
but only the service that they provide.

You have to understand that this is just like if the nodes to which your 
mobile phone is connecting were running Linux. Just because your mobile 
phone is your, you cannot ask for the code of what is running on the node.
