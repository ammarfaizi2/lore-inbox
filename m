Chris,

Nicolas submits a hell of a lot through me.

Nicolas has been around in the Linux community pre-Montavista.  He
maintained the SA1100 patches, and worked to integrate them into my
patches for a fair number of years, from 2.2 right through late 2.4
times, including after he started working for Montavista.  Lately, he
has become responsible for the PXA250 code.

In other words, Nicolas actively participates in the communities
concerning the areas that he works in.

The fact you don't see his submissions or participation is not something
you can or should be using to leverage your point.
