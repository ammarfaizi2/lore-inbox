We all have different priorities. And I've had an extemely bad year (a
dozen different trips, I've moved twice (not by choice), I've got an
ongoing flooding problem where I live now (and the property manager
isn't fixing it right, he's just doing band-aid solutions to reduce
the problem)). On top of all that, I also have a life.

So don't start a stupid flamewar. I could rant about how the VM has
sucked for, what, 3 years now? Or is it longer? It's been so bad for
so long I can't remember anymore when it was good. The only changes
I've noticed are oscillations between bad and worse.

Get off my back.
