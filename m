Hello,

I've been running Debian woody with 2.4.20 kernel.  I'm trying to switch to 
2.5.  I built 2.5.67 with emu10k driver in the kernel (same as I had with 
2.4.20), but I get only a lot of popping sounds from the sound card.  I also 
tried 2.5.50 and 2.5.67-mm3, with the same result.  I googled for emu10k and 
soundblaster with 2.5, but I haven't seen anyone else with the same problem.  
Does anyone know what this problem is?

Thanks,

Udo Hoerhold
