Subject: Re: [2.6] Most likely to be merged by Halloween... THE LIST]

Forgive a silly question due to the odd phrasing of the subject line of 
this thread:

Is Halloween the deadline for submission of patches, or the deadline for 
inclusion?  If I send in reiser4 on Halloween day according to some 
timezone;-), have I made the deadline for inclusion into 2.6 even if it 
takes Linus a few months to reach my place in the queue of patches sent 
to him on Halloween day?

I understand that earlier is better, and I will send it earlier if I 
can, but even if we do get the reiser4 core (that which does all that V3 
does but faster and on top of a plugin infrastructure) done before 
Halloween, we will inevitably add a few features and tweaks after doing 
the core, and we will want to send those in at the last minute.
