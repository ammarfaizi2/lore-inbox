AH!  A man of reason here!

It would be nice if "LI" got in the business of issuing license
subscriptions for binary only modules.  Where the binary vendor must
register and pay a royality fee.  This fee would be used to support "LI"
and defend Linux in a court case if needed.

I personally would gladly pay a reasonable (usual and customary) fee for
the service and right to sell binary models with out having to pay a
lawyer to write a "position" and be prepared to sue every snot nose brat
in the world.

Otherwise, one has to deal with unreasonable people.

There are people who do not work for distros or have found that other
companies want to control their contributions to GPL, but need a means to
support themselves with there other works related to emerging
technologies.

Obviously I am being way to sensible about the issue, and should go use
NetBSD instead and give them the license money.
