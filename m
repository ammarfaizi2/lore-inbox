Earlier I submitted two questions for patches.  I received some responses.
But as the questions were not properly stated, the responses were not very
useful.  so, I am restating the questions once again hoping to clear them
up.  By the way, I am working on a research project that is studying the
kernel patches of all kind.


Q1.  I want to find out what the steps are for submitting and approving a
patch in the Linux kernel?   I know that Linus has sent out an email
regarding the patch approval process and I have read it.

Q2.  I have looked into a mirror site for the kernel (in the university of
Wisconsin web site) for all kinds of patches for the kernel.  I am looking
at all patches for all versions of the kernel.  I would like to find out who
the authors are of these patches.  Can you help me find this info?

Thanks -  Arun
