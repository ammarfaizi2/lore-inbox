  Others are arguing about _subtle_ differences; what Linus did was huge
by comparison.  It's as if they were discussing what shade of red to call
something and Linus came along and declared it green!

  "Release candidate" means candidate for release.  Simple and easy to
understand, no?  Does Linus plan on possibly releaseing -rc1 as 2.6.10
tomorrow?  I don't think so...

  I plan to start testing 2.6.10 upon its final release.
