Thanks for the help.  I memtest86's overnight and came up with no errors on 
my one DIMM of Crucial Non-ECC, Non-parity PC2100 SDRAM (6464Z256).

Updating, strace shows a hang on a /proc/<pid>/stat read, as whown below.  
When run under strace, you can recover the terminal with Ctrl-C if and only 
if no strace log file is specified.

I'd like to use ps, or better yet vmstat as test tools, since they reliable 
freeze.  They are, unfortunately stripped binaries under SuSE 9.0.  Can 
anyone tell me if there's an easy way to get the symbols file(s) for these 
executable(s)?

Also, am I correct in thinking /boot/System.map will allow me to trace into 
the kernel?

TIA,
Bob
