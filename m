It'll stop anything short of a scanning tunneling, or atomic force
microscope. if somebody with access to one of those, and the time to
recover that data wants access to your bits, you're screwed since they're
likely to tap your phone put cameras in your house and so on, I try not to
be invovled in activitiess which result in that sort of attention. ;)
the jagged metal bits and the gapping jagged hole will make short work of
any sort of magnetic head and the surface of platters if you entertain
spinning the thing...
