Subject: 2.5.44 fs corruption
Message-ID: <20021022220737.GA32539@debill.org>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have a happy little dual athlon desktop (Athlon MP1600+ processors -
should be rated for SMP use, no funny stuff), which has been running
nicely for months.  I installed 2.5.44 on it last night, and it seemed
to work fine.

This morning when I went to use it I was greeted by a screen full of
"eth0: transmit timed out" (eth0 being an Intel EtherExpress Pro 100
using the eepro100 driver).  Trying to run commands (like sudo, dmesg,
ping) I got a lot of "unable to execute binary file foo" and IDE
errors complaining about attempts to read past the end of the device.
I was unable to do a graceful reboot, and had to hit the reset button.

Upon reboot my root fs (ext2 under 2.4, but I loaded ext3 under
2.5...) came up corrupted.  Fortunately it didn't seem to hit anything
important (I'll be reinstalling shortly).  None of the other
filesystems (all reiserfs or NFS) had problems.

After repairing the fs I've tried a couple reboots into 2.5.44 to see
if corruption happens immediately - with no luck.  Looks like
something corrupted kernel memory overnight, and ended up stepping on
my filesystem along the way.

I've got an nVidia video card, but I don't use the binary only module.
2.4.18 actually thinks it finds a Radeon.

dmesg from one of the later boots and .config included below.
