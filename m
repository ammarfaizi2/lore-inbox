Hello,
        Thanks to all those who tried the Enhanced Linux Progress
Patch (ELPP) v0.1.  After a few bug-fixes and a few enhancements,
the ELPP v1.0 is now ready to be downloaded.

It can be downloaded from:
  -> http://students.iiit.net/~prasad_s/ELPP/

The following is the summary of features:
  -> Themes can be loaded using the initrd (NEW)
  -> A Qt based tool for making themes (NEW)
  -> A ProgressBar and a few BootMessages
  -> Highly Configurable.  Parameters which could be configured
     include the locations of progress bar, messages, colors,
     boot image etc:

The patch has been tested against linux kernel versions 2.6.0-test4
to 2.6.0-test11, and should work for to-be released kernels too.

Instructions on creating themes, example themes and RH-9.0
init-scripts are also included along with the package.

Comments/Suggestions are welcome.

Prasad.
