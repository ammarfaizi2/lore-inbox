MTV, "Celebrity Death Match" !

RMS starts out and F(l)UDS the arean with piles of GNU.
	(the gnoo is drowning everyone)

LM is stunned by the calm GNOO floodling the area.

RMS using a PRINTER hits LM with a pounding blown to the rear.

LM use a quick attribute of BitMover to reveal the heart of GNU is
	Licensed to BSD!

RMS reaches for the split ends to add more gray fuzz to hide the BSD,
while gazing in the air.

LM removes the printer from his bleeding skinny butt, and wildly swings
knocking off the head of RMS.
	(the blood taints the crowd)

.....
