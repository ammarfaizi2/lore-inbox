Hello,

    I am trying to compile the rtl8139 driver for my SMC
10/100 NIC.  I have turned on all 10/100 devices (i.e. 3Com
cards -n- such); however, I can not get the rtl driver to show
up as an option in my menuconfig.  What to I need to do to
compile this driver as a module.  Am I missing something
else perhaps not in Network Devices.  I do see the rtl8139.c file in my =
drivers/net source tree. =20



Thanks in advance.
