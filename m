Microsoft is no better.  MS don't provide all the software that
runs on windows.  Get some product (say, a word processor) that
competes with with MS office.  Then go try getting help when
that word processor have trouble with your new printer.
MS: "Get word instead, only idiots use that word processor.  Or
 try a different printer.  Maybe the vendor has a newer driver."
Printer vendor: "must be a sw problem, it works fine with office"
Word processor vendor: "It works fine with hundreds of printers,
 use something other than that screwball printer of yours."
Been there, done that.

Nothing wrong with this advice.  Of course the company that prefer
paying for support will simply not see it, the guy they pay for
support will be the one who collect such advice and implement it.

But you can connect.  Your support guy simply have to turn off ECN.
Distributors don't ship ECN kernels anyway, they aren't stupid.  It is
a default only for those who compile their own kernel.

Linux surely don't support all the printers out there.  
This fact is no more problem than the fact that "windows don't
run on ARM, 68040, S/390, and a lot of other platforms linux runs on"

A company buy intel compatible machines for running windows.  And they
buy one of the well-supported printers if they want a linux
print server.  Go for a postscript printer, or one of those with
good ghostscript support.  Not a problem at all.
