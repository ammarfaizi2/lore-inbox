But not all the people out there are skilled enough to install a source
distribution. Also, binary installations may go faster, and the youth of
today tends to not having time...
So there are still problems with it. If one day computers are all so 
fast like the one who compiled a kernel in 7.56 seconds, and we have a 
nice API for compiling, it might be great idea, but it might happen that 
someone else will claim to have had the idea. This certainly won't be me.
