: Finally, I've noticed a few times that the mouse has taken a vacation - i.e.
: I move it and nothing happens.  This goes on for about twenty seconds and then
: all the movements in did in the interum start happening.  During this twenty
: seconds my built-in PS/2 mouse works fine.  Oh, and I get no kernel output 
: from any of this.

More on this problem - it's not a time issue.  It's happened three more times
and I noticed that the mouse suddenly started working when I hit keys (any key)
on the USB keyboard.  And it starts up working by executing everything I did 
to the mouse in the interum
