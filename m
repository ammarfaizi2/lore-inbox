Has anyone started IB support project for Linux yet?  Particularly I am
interested in OS support and verbs layer from Linux side.  I am involved in
an IB product on HCA and TCA side.  Current solution will be emulating scsi
but eventually all IB component is required.  I noticed that kernel 2.4.0
only has IB class defined.

Many thanks!

Eddie
