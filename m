Mail filters are a wonderful thing, use them on me and you want have to
have me shot.  We'll both be happier in the end.

What exactly is it that you can't take?  I made a minor suggestion in
the above message, very minor, and only a suggestion -- one that was
free to be ignorred.  There are over 300 messages a day on this list,
why do the few ones from _me_ bother you.
