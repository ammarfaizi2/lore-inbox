Hi, I have tried first but no success, that's why I wrote to the list.
Google gave me no usuable info about this card. In a mail I found that 
this card maybe qlogic and qla10x0 driver runs it, but there is no such 
driver in the kernel now afaik. I only found qla1280, but that is not 
working.

Maybe I'll give up and try to beg for another scsi card :(
