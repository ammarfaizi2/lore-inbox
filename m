That's true _only_ if the company ships the source _with_ the binaries
when people buy the product.

There are two (commercial) options:

1. If you _always_ distribute source _with_ the binaries, then you only
have to give source to those who receive binaries. And of course you've
already done so.

2. If you ever distribute binaries _without_ source code, then you're
obliged to make the source code available to _any_ third party on
request; _not_ only those to whom you gave the binaries.
