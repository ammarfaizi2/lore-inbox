Hi all,

Recently I got myself a Dell Inspiron 8200 with a Intel P4 Mobile wich has 
SpeedStep technology. With power plugged in, this processor runs at 1.6 
GHz and with battery only, 1.2 GHz. However I've found that the 
/proc/cpuinfo doesn't show this and I was wondering if there were some 
patches lying around before I began to look at this on my own.

Regards,
