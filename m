Hi Keith,

Have you got an update on first-time build performance?  Not that I'm all
that worried about it, incremental performance is *way* more important to
me, however, first-time performance seems to be something of a predictor
of when your work will get into mainline.

I'm marking each day that kbuild 2.5 isn't in mainline on the wall of my
little cave here, as every day kbuild 2.bad.old continues find some way of
wasting my time.

By the way, is there a reason for not providing a single bzip of all the
2.4 + 2.5 files?  Not that the slight inconvenience matters all that much,
since hopefully it will all be in mainline soon.

Downloaded, installing...
