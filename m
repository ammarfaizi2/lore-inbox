Henning,

Lets be realistic here.  If I take my BMW (M series) into the shop because
it has problem yet I tell the German Mechanic that he may not look under
the hood because there is a secret "wonder blunder" inside.  Where do you
think that mechanic is going to tell you to go??

This is the motor(kernel-space) not the paint(user-space).
 
You have admitted that you are an "End-User"(of the kernel) and that you
generally write user-space packages.  I have yet to understand why you are
going out of bounds.  It is clear that you have read to many of my person
best flame-wars here on LKML where I know I must have earned :
	"Arse of the Year, 2000 :: LKML"

> "Fuck off, <insert binary vendor, software or distribution> Luser".

And you slammed me for being rude and ugly??  In my defense of code and
work that I publish, but heavily enforce the license and terms of use.
Since I am aware that about 96% of all linux boxes today use some form of
ATA/ATAPI, it is important that I recover all know fixes public/private
to help everyone.

I now see the joy in watching someone go nuts here on LKML.

Respectfully,

ps. Please keep up the entertainment, I am getting a good belly-laugh
    of what I must have looked like in the past.
