Your point makes sense to me too, but really, this 1 year delay is
nothing compared to the previous status, so this is a great improvement.

The previous licence was not enforceable in Germany and I guess in Italy
too, but really seeing so many other people using a product with such a
licence and without any care (even if void) was unbearable to me.

Now the new licence may still not be enforceable, but I don't care
anymore, because even if it's enforceable by bad luck, it would be
bearable to wait 1 year. Switching SCM is a costly operation regardless.
This time limit has been declared for the first time ever, and this is a
great news, so now the FUD is over.
