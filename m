Red Hat was originally contracted to do an 2.4-uclinux arch port by Fujitsu;
this has been extended since. I did most of the work and various RH engineers
did the rest.

No. I'll add one.

I'll be maintaining it for the time being. This may pass to some combination
of RH and Fujitsu engineers later.

The mailing list and website have yet to be sorted out. I'll amend the
MAINTAINERS record when they have been.

> How widespread is the usage of this architecture?

Given that it's a relatively new port, use of it isn't very widespread yet;
however, I'm given to believe that the processors themselves are very widely
used, and Fujitsu is obviously interested in anything that promotes their own
CPUs.
