Well, I can't see it mentioned anywhere, but perhaps
you're right.  Anyway, thanks for the info.  Although
this isn't so much of a big deal (because of the fixes
and mitagating factor), I think they would be
exploitable in certain conditions, maybe...

Last word: please could you point me to where you saw
an announcement for these bugs in a security advisory?



Thank you for your time.
Shaun.
