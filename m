Hi!

Is there single user of s4bios? It used to work for me 4 notebooks
ago, but I never really used it. I think I'm the only person that ever
seen it working, but I could be wrong. Is there anyone using s4bios in
2.6.11?

If not, I guess we should remove that code from kernel. It is not
usefull, and it is likely broken.
