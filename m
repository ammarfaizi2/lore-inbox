That makes the data /higly/ suspect: Most of the Linux users I know
wouldn't know where to start to compile a kernel, forget about patching
around.  And of the minority who can, they mostly run machines in
production, and won't dream of using non-distribution kernels, let alone
custom patched ones.

BTW, where do you get the "twice as fast" number from?
