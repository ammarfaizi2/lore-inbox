  Smells of some M$ system -- which even isn't a subscriber
  of  linux-kernel  list (at least with that name).
  Perhaps some ISP ?

  The M$-smell comes specifically from "Delivery Time" line, being
  formatted in M$-style way, and entirely lacking time zone info..
  Also the entire message has overall style of M$ environment..
