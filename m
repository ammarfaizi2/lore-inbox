I would be nice to have firmwares for each regulatory domain the hardware
has been certified to work in. My laptops wander from country to country
and spectrum allocation/ouput limits are noticably different or more
limited than they are in the US. It would be nice to be able to be a good
citizen, or at least a law abiding resident alien. On my old cisco b cards
I could change this by flashing it, I have an old nokia b card which has a
dialog in the windows driver utility to set the regulatory domain.

The fcc isn't the only authority that we as users and chipset/card 
vendors have a legal obligation to comply with.

likewise, but one may not be enough.
