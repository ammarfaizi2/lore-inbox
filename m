I've enclosed a copy of `.config' from the 2.2.18pre17+VM-global.

I forgot to mention, and it might be relevant (given that the oops is
in `hung_up_tty_read'), that I'm using a VPN system of my own devising
which gets packets in and out of the kernel by using `slattach' on
pty's; it has no nonstandard kernel component, but probably has some
unusual pty handling behaviour.  If you really want to look at what it
does, the source is on ftp.chiark.greenend.org.uk in ipif/service.c
inside /users/ian/userv/userv-utils-0.2.0.tar.gz.

Ian.
