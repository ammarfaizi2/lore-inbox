 oh, right.  okay.

 i am disappointed by your response.
 
 i will therefore, instead of soliciting your input _before_
 sending to the LKLM, such that the quality of information sent
 to the list is much higher, now need to go ahead without the
 benefit of your advice, such that your input will be required
 as a "fait accomplit" in order to educate other LKML readers,
 with the unfortunate side-effect of an increased amount
 of noise.

 should you change your mind on this matter i would be honoured
 to receive review comments prior to responding, which will
 be in the next few days.
