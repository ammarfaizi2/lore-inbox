We did catch flak on stability issues on 2.4 for whatever the 
reasons. The way I see it we should not move to 3.0 until it's been 
running stable under at least 2.6. The less technical the person 
the more valuable perception becomes. By only moving to 3.0 when 
2.x is seen as totally stable, more new (corporate) people will 
consider it as the foundation for their infrastructure. Look at the 
views of 2.2...

Besides, stability must be more important than features!
