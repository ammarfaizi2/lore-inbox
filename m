...and tell all the people who got a DTLA (because it's not as expensive 
as others in some countries, mind France, USA, Germany) to drop their 
disks if they want to use Linux, because we're too lazy to find a 
solution. That might be cool to you, but we want HARDWARE SUPPORT for 
Linux! That's why we're here.

There _is_ a solution, we just have to find it.
