What about support for JAVA-modules in the kernel? Or modules written in C#? 

In my opinion there are many decent languages (just like C++) and I am 
convinced that there are people out there who think that the Linux kernel 
should support any language they can imagine, because it has such and such 
nice/good/robust/etc. feature.

Neither C or C++ sucks, its just the programmer that sucks.

So Please, end this religious discussion, it leads to nowhere...
