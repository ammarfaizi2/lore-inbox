hello there,

i am keen to do a little bit of kernel programming, but i don't really
know where to start... i have programmed in c for a few years now in
mostly numerical stuff, and i think i could write a device driver if i
really needed to, what would some people reccomend reading before
starting?... i'd be keen to have a pet project of maybe totally
replacing an essential component (just as practice not to make it better
or anything!)

also, my kernel always says "Unknown Bridge Resource 2: Assuming
Transparent" on bootup, why would it be doing this? I have accounted for
everything on my system in the compile

thanks in advance!
Sam
