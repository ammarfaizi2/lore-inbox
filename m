I have this a sony usb walkman ATRAC3 player (nw-e5), obviously has some kind 
of flash memory (don't want to open it and see)
I Don't see any driver for such a thing in the config...
Can I mount this device? I just want to use the momory... What filesystem will 
be appropriate for flash memory?

P.S. I'm not subscribed
