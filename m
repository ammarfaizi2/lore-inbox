Yes, but I cant verify it before Monday.

That leads to another question. usermodehelper_init() is now an initcall.
all the binfmt stuff is also an initcall. We had a patch (for debugging)
that turned init_elf_binfmt() into core_initcall.
Can we change that as well, so one could finally run stuff via the
driver hotplug events? init_script_binfmt() should be also
core_initcall, so you can run scripts. But I havent looked at the
dependencies for the binfmt stuff.
