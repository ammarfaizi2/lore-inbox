Hi All

Could someone please point me to a site or sites where I can find some
commonly used benchmarks.
I have never benchmarked my system and would like to check out
performance numbers with various kernels.

I have a dual Pentium III and run SMP kernels. The performance numbers
may help those working on optimising the kernel for different
architectures.

TIA

John
