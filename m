Hello Kernel developers,
I just got a new machine with 3ware 9000 (raid controller).
 
And when I make the initrd image it says, a driver is missing - 3x-9xxx
which is 3ware 9000 device.
 
What should I do? Am I doing something wrong? Or you just don't have any
support of 3x-9xxx in any of the kernel source additions?
 
 
Hope for prompt reply,
 
Regards,
Gil.
