Hi!

I had sent you an email about your Employee Benefits Program.

Did you get a chance to review it?

I would like to set up a time to talk about how to reduce the cost of
employee benefits, while you expand your benefits to attract and keep key
employees.

When is a good time to talk?

I would like to do a free analysis of your current benefits.


J. Rett
Senior Managing Partner
