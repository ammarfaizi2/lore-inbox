I've read that there is a set of utilities and method for grabbing a 
dump image. I looked at lkcd which is supposed to be avaialable at 
sourceforge. When I try to find the src.rpm or the binary rpm I keep 
going around in a circle and can't get the packages. Can anyone 
recommend a place to grab this or any other way to get a panic dump that 
I can look at in a post mortem?

Thanks for any suggestions... I looked in all the usual places but all I 
get are references to lkcd and hence the questions.
