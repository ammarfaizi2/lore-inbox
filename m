Hi Matti

(please don't consider this a personal attack, just the idea is wrong to me)

This is so against the spirit and meaning of the Internet, you're not 
talking about the network we call Internet. You're talking about two 
tiered internet, which is bad too.

Why don't you go fork the Internet then? Go see if that will work?

This whole discussion is kind of ridiculous for an open source project 
like the linux kernel. If you're so keen on fixing e-mail, you should 
work closely with the IETF working groups to create a new standard that 
works.

Finally, if you consider doing this, why not consider closing the 
mailinglist to a subscription only list, that will work so much better 
than this "free lunch" (to quote someone else)

Cheers

Simon
