Hi, 

I'm running 2.4.9 (same problem with 2.4.8, not sure about other kernels but 
2.4.2 is fine for me). I have 1 gig of ram and dual PIII-750's. Adaptic 
2940U2W SCSI controler. Now when I run 2.4.9 for about 24 hours the swap 
partition fills up. I'm not running anything that would use anywere near 1 
gig of ram. If you need more system information please let me know I"ll 
provied them on a web site or post to this list. 

On a good note, system is stable but seems sluggish at times. I"m reverting 
back to 2.4.2 and since this machien is now longer a production machine I 
can do any testing or any patches since it is my main workstation.  I did 
chat with some people on IRC and I appear not to be the only one with this 
problem.
