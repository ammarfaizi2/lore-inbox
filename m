For the last several kernels I've run I've been unable to do anything
with dvds -- including software dvds.  Watching dvd-video discs also
also fails, again including those w/o css.

CDroms continue to work, only the dvds fail.

Drive is a SONY CD-RW/DVD-ROM CRX810E, FwRev=1.4c laptop ide drive.

I'd estimate it broke starting around 2.5.6x or so.  +/-.

Is anyone else seeing this?  

(I don't use it much for dvds, so it hasn't been enough of an issue
for me to remember to test on each fresh boot.....)
