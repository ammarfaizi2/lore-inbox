The kernel module is indeed less capable by itself, but the userspace
tools are a lot easier to use and show you significantly more
details. Oprofile may have improved since then, but when I started
sysprof:

- oprofile didn't work on anything but smp kernels

- oprofile could not produce callgraph information without not only
  recompiling my kernel, but also patching the kernel

- oprofile had a user interface that I simply didn't understand. As I
  remember it, I had to know about performance counters and how to
  translate those into binary masks

Contrast with sysprof, where you

        - insert the module
        - hit the start button
        - do the thing you want to profile
        - hit the profile button

and you get data presented in a way that is just a whole lot more
useful than the flat text files generated by oprofile.
