    How about expanding the acronym IP to mean "intellectual patrimony" ?

The term "intellectual patrimony" might be a good one for some
purposes, but if you want people to know you are using it, I suggest
you spell it out in full every time.  At present, when people see the
abbreviation "IP", they will think "intellectual property".

However, it is usually best to talk about "copyright", or about
"patents", or about "trademarks", and avoid generalizations that would
tend to blur the boundaries.  The widespread use of "intellectual
property" leads people to suppose these laws (and the issues they
raise) are mostly similar, but they are not.
