Which is the whole point of the FSF copyright assignment. They don't want you 
to relicense it under some other terms. Under the GPL it doesn't matter who 
owns the copyright, so the only point of the copyright assignment is to 
reduce _your_ rights.

I understand why the FSF want to do this (imagine a major free-software 
producer in financial trouble, and a big product (eg GCC and binutils) that 
they could sell to a closed-source vendor). I just don't plan to do this 
myself.
