Closed lists are just *rude*. The only intention is to stop spam,
but personally, I find hoop-jumping like this *more* of an inconvenience
than spam, (and I get a *lot* of spam, several megs a day on a quiet day)

Some maintainers get *really pissed off* when you short-circuit them
and send fixes to Linus directly.  But if I'm forced to jump through hoops
each time I fix up random parts of the kernel, I'm going to be equally
as rude as I consider they are by doing the best they can to inconvenience
people with good intentions, and mail them straight to Linus/Andrew/Marcelo.
