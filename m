I rather like the way the R project does it. They have three lists: one for
developers, one for "announcements" and one for help. The announcements list
is probably irrelevant; the announcements show up on the other two lists. Of
course, if you ask a question on the help list you will be told to RTFM if
necessary. Still, the biggest improvement I'd like to see on LKML is a
usable search engine / archive.
