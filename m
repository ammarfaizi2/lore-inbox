I am waiting to hear from Andrew Hutton - I have the MP3 files available
(240Mb) and ready for him to host of the OLS website. Anyone else care to
host them - Larry can we put them on sourceforge systemras?

The discussion was very good and the BoFs well attended. We had two
sessions. The first discussed
event logging
driver hardening
diagnostics

I counted about 50 folks attending the BoF and we talked for 3 hours.

The second discussion took place on Friday, we had about 20 folks attending
and discussed:
system trace requirements
mcore integration into lkcd.

We could hae gone of for much longer but flight schedules go in the way.

What was very pleasing to see was the level of interest in this subect. It
seems quite clear the Linux is coming of age and that there's a real
interest in makeing Linux a first class candidate for mission critical
employment.

As soon as I can find a home for the MP3 files I'll post lkml.
