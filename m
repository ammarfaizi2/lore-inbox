Thank you very much. I just checked. With the patch applied, it
has booted up successfully.

Finally at last. I will try 2.4-series kernel again. I had the
kernel-swapping
problem. So I have been using 2.2.20pre*aa* kernels for more than
4 months already giving up the 2.4-series around 2.4.5pre*.

Thank you.

Best regards,
