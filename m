Hi,

I just downloaded the 2.4.20-rc1 patch, and it builds and runs fine on 
my i386, but the compilation bombs on my PowerPC. My hardware is a G3 
500Mhz , compiling with gcc 3.2 on Debian's sarge (testing) distro, and 
is the same .config that I used for my 2.4.19 kernel I'm running on it 
at the moment (after doing a make oldconfig). The build fails at:

gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes 
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer 
-I/usr/src/linux/arch/ppc -fsigned-char -msoft-float -pipe -ffixed-r2 
-Wno-uninitialized -mmultiple -mstring   -nostdinc -iwithprefix include 
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=ppc_ksyms  -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c ppc_ksyms.c
ppc_ksyms.c:171:35: missing binary operator
make[1]: *** [ppc_ksyms.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/ppc/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/ppc/kernel] Error 2


Below is my .config. If anyone needs any more info, give me an email and 
I'll do what I can. I tend to read the weekly digest of lkml on 
kt.zork.net, so if you could cc: me in on replies that would be great.

Nathan.
