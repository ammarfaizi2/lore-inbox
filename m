I've just discovered that open source driver for ATI exists.
I hope you mean driver for chipset R300+ (which ATI refuses to
give out information of). I already know there are open source driver
for <=R250.
If you know where to find R300+ driver (supporting 3D) i would be glad
to you to point me to them, googling i found nothing.

Thanks a lot
