    motherboard with two 1.1Ghz Athlon CPU's. First thing I tried was
    of course Linux. I ran into some problems, however.

Linux does support this, and people are using it --- with no
major problems.

Maybe your board is busted?  If you think that not the case, please
try 2.4.7+ and report specifically what the problems are in more
detail if you can (ie. supply dmesg from boot, etc).




Anyhow, you 2.2.x you need something very recent, maybe 2.2.20+ I
think.
