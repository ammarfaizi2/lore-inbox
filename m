Please reread your last sentence. An isolated event caused by the wills 
and actions of a limited group (terrorists, terrorist backers) amongst a 
larger group (pakistanese people as a whole including children that 
don't even know the meaning of the word terrorist) is definitely nowhere 
near a proof of something concerning the larger group.
Stating otherwise to promote segregation is pure racism.

So do I if I understand the following correctly. You could call it 
narrow-sighted but I'm very reluctent to increase the market share (and 
by that overall influence) of software excluding people for no other 
reason that their nationality.
Segregating groups of people nearly always help sustain violence between 
people. Please verify this statement on past and current conflicts.

As long as proprietary software is not made unlawful where's the problem ?
You may link full-freesoftware inclination with communism if proprietary 
software was forbiden (and competition between free software projects is 
proved to be flawed) but I've never seen Richard state something like 
this. If I missed something feel free to point me where to look.

Free software evolves in a different way than proprietary software. This 
is true that most innovative products come with proprietary licenses 
now. But I'm not sure this fact comes from the license differences.
Free software and proprietary software don't yet play on an even field. 
There are huge inertial effects slowing Free Software market penetration 
now. When the field will be even and some time will have passed we'll 
know what places the two kinds will have and if the proprietary one 
really lies in "innovative products" land.
Until then, enjoy the ride...

Depends on the amount of cash you have in the bank and your income. If 
your current situation suits you, more won't motivate you as much as 
something you desire and money can't buy (and there's a lot of this kind 
out there).
What motivates me the most now (that the cash comes in regularly) is the 
ability to learn and interact with various people. I've not yet had 
enough of both. Most people spend their whole life pursuing various 
ideals, relatively few want to be the richest person on Earth...

Richard is an idealist. He can be annoying when you have your own feet 
on the ground but setting your goals too high isn't a bad motivation for 
making yourself better (unless you become an extremist of course)...



To come back on the Nvidia subject :

Considering the top performance mainstream 3D market now (ATI vs 
Nvidia), seeing that:
- both ATI and Nvidia have efficient proprietary drivers for their 
latest products (ATI ones are young and may still have problems I've not 
heard of yet),
- at least ATI 8500 cards have an efficient OSS driver in the works 
indicating ATI didn't make hiding *all* specs their internal policy.

Nvidia won't be an option for me and for every people that rely on my 
advices unless they open their specs or the market reverts back to a 
Nvidia monopol.

For the record, SiS lost directly at least tens and maybe hundreds of 
chipset sells when I was forced to tell potential customers contacting 
me directly that racks full of 645DX based systems might have to use PIO 
modes for all IDE transfers until SiS moved to help on sis5513.c ...
Since then every other potential customer was directed to appropriate 
kernel versions or kindly provided patches for their exotic 
patched-kernel configurations (some don't even know how lucky they are 
that I love to study new stuff)...

Remember : the fittest survives...

LB.
