Hello,

Sorry, maybe it's an OT here but I'm out of ideas (including google). My
problem is our Compaq Armada E500. It worked quite well with 2.4.x kernels.
However with 2.6.x kernels it always freezes. No log or opps, and the exact
time of freezing varies but it seems it has some connection with accessing
the sound hardware and/or pcmcia. But not always. I've tried everything,
disabling/enabling apic, and dozens of combinations of kernel parameters
from various sources with no solution ... It renders this notebook unusable
for us, since distribution(s) we wanted to use already changed from 2.4.x
kernels to 2.6. Is there ANY ideas? On request I can send various
information on this notebook, but at the moment I can't. Thanx in advance.

- Gábor
