Actually I believe this thread was worth something, if not just to get a
feel of what is going to happen when Ingo and the rest of us try to get
it accepted.  It at least opened my eyes to what people think of the
patch, and what some people's fears are.  I'm archiving the whole damn
thread so that I can reference it when the time comes to merge the RT
patch in. (I may be able to contradict someone with their own words ;-}

With that... I think this thread is officially dead! (I hope)
