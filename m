Why are you so against somebody sitting down and thinking, "OK, we
need a bug tracking database designed for debugging the Linux
kernel."?  I don't understand why you think it's a bad idea to start
over.  If my code was rubbish, then it wouldn't get used, and I wasted
my time.  Nobody else suffers.

Well, since it's me that's offering to write the code, don't I get to
decide how to write it?

Besides, I'm not the only person who thinks it's a good idea to start
over sometimes - Eric Raymond even addresses this point in The
Cathedreal and the Bazaar.

If not, I will admit you were right to the list :-).
