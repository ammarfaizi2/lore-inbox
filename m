Funny, when I was returning from Austin Texas with a stop at
Dallas, the B777 encountered a problem with the 1st officer's
flight-director display so the airplane was delayed while the
maintenance crew replaced a LRU. I watched as it was started
up, "booted". It was Windows CE!  Now, that's "mission critical!"
