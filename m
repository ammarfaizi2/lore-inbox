If you were such an advanced Linux user you'd read this list or at least
search it to understand the problems.  DevFS may have seemed fine to
you, but the code is nasty and full of races.  It's overly complicated
and the problems it exhibits were determined to not be easily fixable
and not worth the time.  DevFS never really took off and it was under
development for a good part of 4 years.  Richard Gooch did an admirable
job trying to come up with a new solution to the old /dev situation, but
frankly a new approach was needed, and he himself recognized this and
abandoned devfs.

How do you know this?  Have you looked at the code to both?  You can't
be telling me you've looked at the devfs code and think its superior in
any way to other pitiful hacks in the kernel.  Come on now.  And UDEV
and libsysfs are works in progress, and I must say they've come a long
way in a very short time.  Kudos to Greg and others BTW.

UDEV is currently slow right now while some libsysfs changes are being
made IIRC.  Not a very apt comparison.

See above.

How on earth do you figure this?  The /sys directory is links to things
that are already in memory, it is just providing a way to access those
structures and information, think procfs.

It's still young and will be better as time passes.  At least UDEV isn't
going to take 4 years and come out with crap.

Honestly I'm trying to sound insulting here, but consider the fact that
only a couple of people are currently working on UDEV, and yeah some
things are hacked together right now.  And remember init is mostly shell
scripts, I don't see how this is so inferior.

Here we go, IMO, I like that :)  The thing is, you need some cooperation
and balance between the kernel and userspace.  Things are shelled off to
userspace because they can be, and it also takes burden off the core
kernel functions and reduces the kernel's memory footprint.  This is
good for embedded devices too.


Ok for the sake of non-argument, keep using devfs if you want, but
remember it is obsolete, and nothing is going to change that AFICS.

Good Luck,
