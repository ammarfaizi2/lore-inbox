You know, I've heard this arguement a few times in various contexts and
it's bothered me everytime. If a virus was designed with specific
properties that hinder unauthorized copyright infringement then attempts
to circumvent the limitations would be an example of DMCA circumvention.

This misses the whole point that in order to deliver the second and more
important part of the virus requires the author to self-identify to the
US federal government and somehow get them to prosecute the offender. Now
at this point, how many of these authors aren't going to be immediately
charged with something heinous for the act of writting the offensive thing
in the first place? And do you seriously think you're going to convince
Ashcroft and company to prosecute Symantec for getting rid of a virus even
if it is DMCA 'protected'?

GAAAAA!
