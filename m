You're going to find the most intelligent people who know about the subject at hand on here anyway. I dont think you'll invoke Linus' wrath; instead you might get him to join in on your healthy conversation and he and others can enlighten us on why the design is what it is, and where we're headed. I don't forsee a few postings invoking discussion causing any issues or trouble on here. :)

Eh, I've had people ask me to stop spamming the list with dumb questions
and controversial posts before.  Then again, the sheer volume here and
the threaded view in any normal mail reader makes it kind of hard to
affect the S/N ratio without a lot of concentrated effort.
