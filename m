Dualhead is not working with the current kernel(2.4.3).
With 2.4.2 it was working just fine.
I have not used any special compiler flags,just the usual ones
and I am not loading XFree.
Also does anyone know why when I change from Xfree to console
most of the times the console is corrupted..?
This is a problem which I have noticed from Xfree-4.0 and after.

Thanks in advance.
