Mircea,

Subject: [OT] Linux iSCSI server implementation

	Estemeed kernel developers,

	I adress you this offtopic question, but I know that only here I
can 
find a corect and authoritative answer:

	Did some of you know a reliable and production ready implementation
of 
iSCSI server ( host adapter) protocol because I was able to find only 
client software for Linux.

	Thank you for your help and patince,

		Mircea Ciocan
