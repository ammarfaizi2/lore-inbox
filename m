>From version 2.4 to version 2.6 the kernel input system underwent a
total rewrite. One of the side effects of this has been that programs
are not able to read the input devices in raw mode. Rather, the kernel
has a few internal tables that translate from the keycodes to a
specific *emulated* set of "raw mode" scancodes.

For unassigned keys, you can do (from the console)

setkeycodes <unhandled scancode> <assigned keycode>

to assign a particular keycode to a particular (unhandled) scancode,
and this *will* make the key recognized outside of the kernel too
(e.g. in X).

HOWEVER, at least for PS/2 keyboards (I don't have an USB keyboard and
don't know what kind of keyboard is yours) the raw scan code reported
to programs like X will *not* be the actual key scancode (i.e. the one
you fill up in <unhandled scancode> above). Which I think is a bug in
the new input system.

I have a problem similar to yours: I have a Dell laptop (Inspiron
8200) with 7 multimedia keys; three of these (volume up/down/mute) are
correctly recognized by the kernel and correctly passed over to other
apps (in particular the X server), the other four are unhandled (0x81
to 0x84).

The X keymaps include support for the Dell Inspiron keys (by means of
inet(inspiron)), and this works perfectly when using a 2.4 kernel. The
volume keys still work with the 2.6.

To make the other four keys work "correctly" (with the same map) I had
to manually search through all the keycodes until I found those that
got backtranslated to the "correct" scancodes for X. (My final finding
was that I had to map e001 to 171, e002 to 172, e003 to 187 and e004
189).

If you look at some past messages on the topic (search e.g. for
Inspiron 8200) you'll see that this was already discussed.

However, I just noticed that the atkbd module has a (don't know how
recent) option "softraw". I'm not sure what it does exactly, though.
