Hi Everybody

Here are diff files to add the PCI services changes that were required
for the Hot Swap demo Motorola did at Linux Expo.  There will be other
aspects of high availability and PowerPC support from Motorola in the
near future.

In the near future, Motorola will have a web site where these and others
can be downloaded.  I will keep you posted.

I look forward to working with the Linux community futher.
