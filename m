	You have those rights the law gives you and those rights that the 
copyright holder chooses to give you in the transfer agreement.

	Sounds like every shrink wrap agreement in the world. You already 
have the thing you want to license, the licensee simply refuses to 
grant you the rights to that thing you already have unless you agree 
to a license that you are not free to negotiate.

	This is the same for use. If Microsoft wants to, they can impose any
terms in the EULA that they want.

	Microsoft doesn't try to argue that every document I write in 
Windows 2000 is a derived work. Photoshop doesn't argue that every 
image I create in photoshop is a derived work.

	All you can do with a header file is include it in your own code. 
All you can do with photoshop is produce photoshop files. Adobe 
doesn't argue that photoshop-created images are derived works. 
Stallman *does* argue that Linux binary modules are derived works.

	To support the GPL's ability to regulate the distribution of derived
works you would have to argue that Adobe's EULA could legitimately 
prohibit you from distributing images you create with photoshop. Far 
smarter for advocates of freedom to argue that this is fair use and 
the argument that such works are derived is bullcrap.

	Yes, but this is *use*, which is what the GPL is *not* supposed to 
stop. How can you use photoshop except to create images with it? How 
can you use a header file except to include it in your own code. I 
argue that we should take the position that this type of normal use 
does not create a derived work any more than reading a novel makes 
your brain a derived work of that novel.

	The argument is over what is a derived work, what constitutes 
"using" a header file, and what constitutes agreement to a contract.

	I guess I haven't made myself clear. My argument is not specifically
with the GPL except in the sense that it requires people who support 
it to take anti-freedom positions with respect to fair use, derived 
works, first sale, and other important issues where actual 
information freedom is at stake.

	I'm afraid I'm too tired right now to respond to the rest of your 
argument. I hope I didn't miss anything importasnt.
