Hello lkml,
	I just oldconfiged linux kernel with my 2.4.1 .config. When I boot the new
2.4.1-ac20 kernel, I get a message saying that my ext2 superblock is corrup=
ted.
I get a message asking me to run e2fsck -b 8193 <...hdd dev..>
My 2.4.0-ac4 that I've been running for more than 2-3 weeks now has no prob=
lems
booting though.

	What am I doing wrong ? I would be glad to give more info.

Here is the ver_linux output of 2.4.0-ac24 kernel. Every thing but the kern=
el must=20
be same.
