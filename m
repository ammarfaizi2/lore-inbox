The difference between using our idle cpu cycles for seti@home or just 
leaving the xeons and opterons idle when they're not crunching away is 
around $1300 a month (yes, I know it's a big datacenter) slightly more 
than half that, is the cooling used to remove the heat generated by the 
machines. the rest is the machines themselves.

Why pay for power you don't need to use. Why pay for a ups thats bigger 
then it has to be. Why pay for more hvac then you need. Even now an idle 
rack of dual opterons 244s is something like 4-5kw, busy is more like 
6.8-8kw.

or lower their costs, or both.
