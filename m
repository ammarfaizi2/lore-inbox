Doug, you're a life saver.=20

For some reason, if you go to LinuxDoc and search (as I did) for "SCSI",
the first 33 entries all refer to the 1996 version of this document! It
didn't occur to me that they would have both the old and new versions on
line.

Again, thanks for the tips! While I'm an old hand at UNIX (and at
various freeware projects) I'm quite new to the Linux environment.

Yeah, that seems to be my experience.=20

Thanks again.
