The only ism Hollywood believes in is plagiarism.     
Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect. 
Money can't buy happiness; it can, however, rent it.    
We cannot really love anybody with whom we never laugh.   
'Tisn't life that matters! 'Tis the courage you bring to it.
