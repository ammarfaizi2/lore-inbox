Derivative works are not really a question of where something is, think
about a distributed computation, or a tool which partly compiles a
program into VHDL for high performance execution.

I'm not sure this is a useful kernel list argument anyway since I am
sure Intel legal will have considered the question and reached their own
conclusions and also vendors and Intel will continue beating each other
up until a neat solution is found.

For Intel sure, if it owns all the bits then it can do what it likes
with its bits.

Oh I understand *why* the issue arises, and as a licensed radio amateur
I'm quite well aware of the concerns. I'm also permitted to use 2.4Ghz
at higher power for amateur purposes.
