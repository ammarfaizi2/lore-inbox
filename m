I don't think anyone says the GPL is a perfect license

Red Hat is using OSL for various new projects based on the fact that
lawyers and legal scholars think that the OSL is the better license to
be using and that it achieves desired goals for free software. The
kernel however is GPL and its kind of hard to change that. Certainly Red
Hat can't do that. 

OSL wasn't around when the kernel began or my guess is Linus would have
gone that way to avoid political baggage.
