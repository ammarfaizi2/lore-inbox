Wow, I don't know what to think...

I didn't cite any private mail I got from people, including Larry himself,
but after such enlightening private responses I got from Larry like the one
that read, in toto: "In your opinion"

I have apparently been declared either winner or pariah:

Sorry, I've had enough.  I started getting private mail from people
saying they have been in the same sort of argument with you over
technical issues and you not only didn't get it right, you refused
for weeks to not see that you didn't get it right.  That's good
enough for me.  Sorry, I just can't waste this much time.

=== end message ===

I wonder how many other "Robert White"s have just been barred from
interacting with his company.  He probably should have used my company name
or at least my email address...
