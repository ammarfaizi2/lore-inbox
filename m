Hi, Ron,

     I am interested the problem you posted. I tried to reproduce this
problem on my machine and failed. Would you please point your programs to
me, so I can reproduce this problem and do more investigation? If not,
please let me know whether it is reproducible, and please collect both
client/server ethereal log.

Thanks in advance.
