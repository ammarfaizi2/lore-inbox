Hello all!

I just would like to know what's missing to the start of the development of 
the kernel 2.5, and the mantaince of the 2.4 to go to Alan Cox ?

I'm asking this because I see a very good stability of the 2.4 tree, and the 
need of the start of the development of 2.5.

Currently, 2.4 is just getting small fixes, that could be easily managed by 
Alan.

Does Linus have any schedule to pass the control of 2.4 management to someone 
else, and start developing the great 2.5 kernel?


Regards,
Thiago Vinhas
