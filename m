Actually, they do.

The 3b "source code, at cost, if you want it later" offer, if that's 
the offer the vendor chooses to give, must be made to "any 3rd 
party".

Easiest way for a vendor to avoid having to make source available on 
request to any and all is obviously to provide a source with the 
product/binaries.
