DEAR SIR,
  I GOT YOUR CONTACT AFTER A CAREFUL STUDY OF YOUR
  COUNTRY'S BUSINESS/TRADE DIRECTORY.
  I AM DR  KENNETH   SANI,  THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF THE
  FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA.  FOUR (4) MONTHS AGO,I
  LED A 3 MAN AUDIT PANEL TO BALANCE THE BOOKS OF THE
  APEX BANK (CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA). IN THE COURSE OF
  OUR DUTIES, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SUM OF $42.5
  MILLION (FORTY TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S.
  DOLLARS) HAS BEEN LYING IN A SUSPENCE ACCOUNT WITH THE
  APEX BANK SINCE 1998 WITHOUT BENEFICIARY(IES).FUTHER
  INVESTIGATION REVEALS THAT THIS SUM ACCOMMULATED AS A
  RESULT OF  OVER-INVOICED  EXECUTED CONTRACTS
  INFLUENCED BY PAST RETIRED MILITARY GOVERNMENT
  PERSONNELS AND WAS UNCLAIMED DUE TO TRANSFORMATION OF
  NEW DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.

  AFTER CAREFUL DELIBERATIONS, WE (MY COLLEAGUES AND I)
  UNANIMOUSLY AGREED TO TRANSFER THIS SUM OF $42.5
  MILLION INTO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENT
  PURPOSES, HENCE WE ARE SEEKING YOUR ASSISTANCE AND
  CO-OPERATION TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. WE HAVE PUT
  ALL MODALITIES IN PLACE TO APPLY FOR THE TRANSFER OF
  THIS FUND TO YOU OR YOUR COMPANY AS CONTRACT PAYMENT
  HAVING COMPLETED A CONTRACT WE PURPORTEDLY AWARDED TO
 YOU.
  HOWEVER, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERED THIS FUND
  THROUGH DIPLOMATIC SEAL TO OUR OFF-SHORE PAYMENT
  BUREAU IN OVERSEAS ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS MEANT
  FOR THE PAYMENT OF A FOREIGN CONTRACTOR.  WE
  THEREFORE, SOLICIT THAT YOU RECEIVE THIS SUM INTO YOUR
ACCOUNT ON OUR BEHALF FROM THE OFF-SHORE PAYMENT  OFFICE.>
  NOTE THAT WE WILL ARRANGE ALL THE PAPERS NEEDED AND
  THE APPROVAL FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS FUND WITH A
  DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF THE CONTRACT EXECUTED TO ENABLE
  SWIFT REMITTANCE INTO YOUR ACCOUNT WITHOUT ANY HITCH.
  
THEREFORE, THERE IS NO RISK WHATSOEVER EITHER NOW OR
  IN FUTURE.
  IF NEED BE FOR YOU TO VISIT THE OFF-SHORE OFFICE, YOU
  WOULD BE ASSISTED BY A PROTOCOL OFFICER TO OPEN AN
  ACCOUNT WERE THE MONEY WOULD BE LODGED AFTER PAYMENT
  THEN TRANSFER TO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WISH THEREAFTER.  YOU
  WILL GET 30% OF THE ENTIRE SUM, 65% FOR US, WHILE 5%
  IS SET ASIDE FOR RE-EMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES WE MAY
  INCURE IN ACTUALISING THIS TRANSACTION.  IT IS
  IMPORTANT TO STATE THAT ALL PARTIES WOULD BE PROTECTED
  BY A SILENT BUT STRONG AGREEMENT WHICH GREATEST TENET
  WOULD BE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AS WE ARE CIVIL
  SERVANTS STILL IN ACTIVE SERVICE.  IF YOU ARE
 INTERESTED, CONTACT ME
  THROUGH MY EMAIL ADDRESS. FIVE (5) BANK
  WORKING DAYS IS ENOUGH TO CONCLUDE THIS TRANSACTION.
  I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PROMPT REPLY.
 BEST REGARD
 DR  KENNETH   SANI.
