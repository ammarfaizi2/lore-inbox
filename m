Hmm, it's the result of infrequent update of alsa git tree...

Yes, alsa-current git contains more changes currently in ALSA HG
repo.  alsa git contains only (safe and important) changes for
upstream.

In this patchset, the biggest patch is the addition of echoaudio
driver.
It's OK to postpone this for 2.6.19.  But this driver has been tested
over three years although unfortunately it didn't land to mm by
mistake (we forgot to move the code after 2.6.17 feature freeze).

Another relatively big patch is the fix for realtek codecs.  This is
no intrusive patch but addition of the support of more new devices.
It should get in, if we want to reduce the future bugzilla entries :)

The rest are obvious fixes, picked up from LKML and alsa-devel.  They
need to be merged anyway sooner or later.
