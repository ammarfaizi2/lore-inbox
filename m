I know your problems with the NVdriver and I understand it. Also I don't like 
it. I has many bugs and is not closed source, I understand that no developer 
wants to work with that.
But I have a Desktop system. I play games. I can't remove that driver.
I am running 2.4.19 since it is out and never had such problems with the 
NVDriver.

I will test my mem this night, and than I slow down the Nvidia chip (sometime 
that helps).

If nothing helps, I will try to remove the module.


But thanks for your answers
have fun
Felix
