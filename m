I'm new to this list so I'd like to say hi first :-)

I found this message while searching for a solution to getting
linux to see a raid array on my HPT370:

http://www.mailgate.org/linux/linux.dev.raid/msg00163.html

Its got someone from highpoint saying that raid support will
be offered "in the near future", and that message was dated October 2000.

I emailed highpoint to ask if they had got any where, but they dont seem to
reply.

Does any one know if highpoint are in fact developing a linux driver
that supports the RAID functions of this chip? and if so, are we looking
at weeks/months/years before it might be ready?

ps: hedricks ide patch doesnt support the RAID functions of the chip,
    otherwise I would have been happy to use that! :-)

Many thanks

Brad.
