Subject: Keyboard/mouse broken under 2.6.[57].

After I upgraded my server, I noticed eventually that the keyboard and mouse
were not working properly.
The mouse was completely dead, and the keyboard intermittent.
Ok,  I thought, and replaced the motherboard.

Similar, though not identical problem.

Apr 26 05:06:03 mauve kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, co
de 0x0 on isa0060/serio0).
Apr 26 05:06:03 mauve kernel: atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes 00 <keycode>' to make it
  known.

Apr 26 05:06:19 mauve kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, co

  known.

Fills the logs copiously.
On one motherboard, the mouse works - mostly, on the other it doesn't, on both
the keyboards are intermittent.

The problem seems to be worsened by loading the iteraid module, though the mouse
does not work beforehand on the motherboard where it doesn't, so I think
that's triggering the manifestation of a bug rather than creating one.

Any thoughts?
