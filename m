Hi all.
I've got a cisco 4800 aironet card, that is detected successfully by the 
driver in the kernel.  However, when I configure with ifup, it says that it 
doesn't
understand hardware address 801 for wifi0.
I'm running debian unstable on an athlon 2.07 ghz with 256 mb ram.
Please cc me directly in all replies.
