You seem to be unable to distinct between cause and effect.

	Some pleople at Linux kernel ML did start to flame me while I was
	trying to do my best to give technical based explanations.

As it has been proven that threre _are_ reasonable people in LKML, it would 
help LKML to regain credibility if they could try to do some self cleaning
and find a way to calm down the non-serious people.


You also seem to be unable to judge where bugs are located while looking at 
problems.

	It seems that we just agreed with the reasonable members of LKML
	that there was and still is a security related bug in Linux.
	The "fix" that used in hope to remove the security problems did just
	create new problems instead of removing old ones.

If you have nothing useful to say, please stay quiet.
