Thanks very much for your interest in utrace and for your comments.
Unfortunately, I cannot say exactly when I will be able to respond
to them in detail.  I broke my arm in September and have had a
difficult recovery, including a second surgery in November, two
weeks ago.  I am now immobilized such that I cannot type properly,
and will be unable to type much until some time in January.  Issues
in getting utrace merged are indeed my top priority after fixing
known bugs in the current utrace code.  My injury came at a quite
inopportune time.  I do not want to start the discussion in earnest
before I am again able to participate, and to hack on the code,
with the vigor and verbosity I usually expect of myself.


Thanks for your patience,
Roland
