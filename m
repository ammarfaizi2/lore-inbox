What model Dell card exactly? I'm looking to buy a Linux-compatible 
minipci wireless card (no Centrino for obvious reasons), and the only 
models I've found listed at http://tuxmobil.org/minipci_linux.html are 
apparently no longer for sale. I'd rather not pay for a Cisco Aironet 
but I'm afraid I might have to.
