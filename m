Hi,

I wish to view the oops that are normally output on the serial port of 
the PC. The problem I have, is that my PC does not have a serial port.
Are there any alternatives for getting that vital oops from the kernel 
just as it crashes apart from the serial console.
Could I get it to use some other interface? e.g. Network interface.
Parallel port is also not an option.

James
