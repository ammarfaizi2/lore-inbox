Hello
I'm trying to make ACPI suspend to ram work on my computer with kernel- 
2.6.5. Saying echo -n "mem" >/sys/power/state seems to work fine and it  
suspends the machine, but it fails to resume - it halts with blank  
screen.
The kernel version is 2.6.5, with the bootsplash patch, and the machine  
is: Asus A7V8X-X motherboard (with the latest bios), integrated via8235  
sound, and integrated via-rhine eth and Geforce2 video (with the binary  
driver from Nvidia).
 Standy mode doesn't seem to be ok either. Sometimes it works, but  
resumes with a message : APIC error on CPU0: 80(08), but mostly it  
freezes.
Is it a known problem, or it's my setup, or the hardware's fault?

I dont't know, whether it's a relevant information, but it worked with  
windowsxp.

Here is my kernel config, if it's needed.
