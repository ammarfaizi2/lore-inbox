Some very long, and pointless, arguments can be had about which was
_first_.  Lets talk about something more interesting - which ones are still
usable :)  I do recall that Motorola Computer Group was very very unhappy
that an Alpha from DEC arrived for Linus before their PowerStack.  Maybe
you can compare who shipped a machine to Linus first, then compare which
was powered on and so on.

I believe Linus only re-did the Alpha port.  It was first done inside DEC.
They should get credit for getting on the Linux bandwagon early on.

} *beep* The m68k port is older, and IIRC the MIPS port is older as well. Those
} weren't started by Linus, though.
