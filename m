   the previous 5 successful real-time Linux workshops held in Vienna,
   Orlando, Milano, Boston, and Valencia, the Real-Time Linux Workshop
   for 2004 will come to Asia for the first time, to be held at the
   Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
   
   Embedded Linux is rapidly gaining traction in the Asia Pacific region.
   China recently developed two homegrown embedded Linux based smart
   cellphones. The Consumer Electronics Linux Forum was formed in July
   2003, with representatives from major Japanese, Korean, and Chinese
   companies. The world's largest telecommunication company, based in
   Japan, recently joined the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) in
   February 2004.
