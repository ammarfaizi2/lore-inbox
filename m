DANGEROUS == GO_FOR_IT_DUMB_ARSE_SCREW_YOURSELF_WILDLY

This is the intent, when I put and started the DANGEROUS settings.
Because the volitale nature of extreme alpha code in the beginning.
However as time passed, people did not think it had meaning, but that is

This is UNIX, and to quote one of HPA's signatures,
"unix gives you enough rope to hang yourself"

My personal favorite:
	You are going to shoot yourself in the head, aim carefully!
	How well you aim determines if you get a second chance!
