I can't respond to the emotion and ad hominum references in this 
message. The uSDE announcement is my first posting. I can't address any 
past dealings with MontaVista.

The uSDE ideas and implementation was started with the OSDL requirements 
in August of 2002.
This is the first time any form of it has been posted. From 
time-to-time, since the project started, ideas related to it have been 
floated with the community. The feedback was carefully listened to and 
utitized in the implementation that was just posted.
