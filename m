This sounds like a sensible idea.

I honestly don't understand why people let themselves get all worked up
and spend so much energy on someone who's clearly diverging in their
ideals from the spirit of the community.  I also don't know why they
think they have a right to demand things of a volunteer in the first
place.

The only difference between this troll and any other troll is that the
troll is the original author and copyright holder, but he appears to
have stepped down as a Free Software author.

Why spend effort on trolls when you can instead branch/fork the code
base and spend that effort productively?

Sam.
