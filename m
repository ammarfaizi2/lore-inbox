'Course. Sorry, I'm quite out of bounds since I heard that tonight some of 
my friends possibly got lost in the storm in Germany. I wished them lots 
of fun on their canoe tour at the Mueritz...

I think I'll get back there tonight, so don't expect many responses, TAs

The patch w/ the shortened-update is now at
