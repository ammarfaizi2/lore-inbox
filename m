You don't think a message announcing the test10 release combined with that 
release actually showing up on kernel.org is a good indicator that it really 
is Linus? The release is there.

If I was going to spoof Linus's address, I'd try and say something more clever 
than "here's another release, I may hand things off to Andrew soon, and I'm 
thinking of naming it after another oddly modified small furry mammal."

If it was spoofed, this person may have saved Linus some valuable time with 
his family. :-)
