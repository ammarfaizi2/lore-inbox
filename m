    If you're really worried, have the person with access to the MS code
write a patch, and then have someone without access to the MS code
reimplement the patch. Make sure that all that is taken from the orignially
written patch are ideas and algorithms, not actual code.

    Of course, you would still have to carefully read the actual license
before deciding on the correct isolation scheme.
