Feel free to open a 'bug report' on my bug database just to upload a
working .config - I.E. you can use it as a somewhat-organised, and
comment-onable .config storage repository, if that's any use.

http://grabjohn.com/kernelbugdatabase/

If there is sufficient interest, I can add some code to pick out the
common config options out of a set of config files, or whatever you
want.  Just ask, and the feature will be, (eventually), added :-)

John.
