Not at all.  Copyright law is to promote the progress of
sciences and arts;  in short, it is about the rights of
mankind, not about the rights of authors.

The temporary monopoly which authors get over their work
is there to encourage authors to create more works, which
in turn benefit all of mankind.  Just a side effect to
promote the good of the many.
