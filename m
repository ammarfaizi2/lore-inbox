Free software is an empowering agent.  Petitions as a technique are
only a good choice when you have no power to affect things.  And even
then they only affect when you get enough signatories.

Please use the power you have and do something productive.  Everyone
has exactly as much power as Linus to move the Linux kernel forward.  Not
everyone has as much trust, or as much ability but that is something
anyone can build.

Free software is not an entitlement, nor is it a right.  And it has no
official government support so it is not likely to become an entitlement.
Instead free software is the product of people working hard to make
certain free software is available.  And the classic motto
is show me the code.  Or the Texas version show me.

Please show that there is something good that does a better.  Or use
this as a call to arms to write it.  Or perhaps find a way to pay
Larry McVoy enough so that he will open source it.

Eric
