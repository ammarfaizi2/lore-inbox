OK, I need even more help here.  Isn't it Felten the one doing the suing in
that case.  I need more clarification.  I've tried to read both the EFF
pages as well as other sources and I don't even see where he has been sued
under the DMCA (although it does look like he was theatened with legal
action from the RIAA).  Has there been a recent ruling that I've been too
busy to see lately.

Thanks,
Tom
