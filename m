Not even then, unless you can convince each and every contributor to 
relicense their contribution to you under something other than the GPL. 
(My reading of the license is that there is _no_ legality-based 
exception to the pertinent "derivative works" clause, though I could 
easily be wrong). Your change summaries are your original work, so you 
are of course free to withold information there at your discretion ;-)
