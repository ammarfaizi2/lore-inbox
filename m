I stand corrected, this means that all of the distros shipped 2.4 before they
should have.  (I use SuSE 7.2.  I thought that 7.1 had a 2.2 kernel as the
default, but I guess I was wrong.)  

SuSE has its flaws also.  I have complained to them about the yast license, for
instance.  (I think the best single thing they could do for SuSE sales is change
that license.)  All the distros I know of except debian like to put kernel
patches into their distros first.  You would think they would want them in the
kernel first so that they could know they are stable, but that would give them
no "advantage".  Sigh.  I suppose there are much worse things they could do.

PS

I don't get money from SuSE anymore, I get it from DARPA.  I do run SuSE on my
computer though, which is probably enough to bias me.
