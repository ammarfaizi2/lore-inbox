Oh by the way, I need hackers for my cabinet. I have the US Code on my FTP
site,
        ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/install/clienux/packages

It took a week to pull it out of the retarded privatized interface the GPO
has it behind. Talk about bloat. It makes Common Lisp look like Chuck
Moore's latest Forth chip. I also need somebody to liberate the CFR, the
Code of Federal Regulations.

I need some people that haven't forgotten how to use a computer to do
basic cleanups like convert "intelligence" in the CIA sense to "strinfo",
shut down the war on herbs, eliminate using the tax laws as a form of
subsidy, et cetera. The better hackers will get cabinet positions.
Otherwise I'll promote from the existing staff.
