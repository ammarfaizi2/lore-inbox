That part about this I don't understand is why you're disclosing
your propietary non-free software in unstable at all. Simply
remove it from the tarball and you don't have to worry about
illegal copies making the round; after all you still have to
provide the GPLed part of the code at least to the buyers of the
unstable version which themselves have the right to spread it.

Servus,
