Case law as you know it is not present in continental Europe, it's only 
present in some countries overseas.

In continental Europe, we have laws that cover every detail [1].
Therefore, in continental Europe, we don't cite some court cases ruled 
two centuries ago - we cite the paragraphs of the corresponding laws.

If the copyright law (like the German copyright law) says something, the 
only way to change it is a change of the law [2].


Larry, if you don't believe me, please ask any lawyer who roughly knows 
both your and our law systems about this.

[1] e.g. in Germany our "Buergerliches Gesetzbuch" (our main book of 
    civil law) contains four paragraphs covering swarms of bees - what 
    happens if two swarms of different owners unite, you are allowed to 
    enter foreign estates to capture your swarm of bees etc. - it's all 
    explicitely covered by the law
[2] the exception is that our highest court may say a law or a
    paragraph of a law is void because it violates our constitution
