  As I see the problem, the proposal has been either rejected or
postponed, and some people refuse to accept that. I would love to see the
best of O1 and preempt in 2.4, too, but I'm not going to ask anyone to
write Linus, or Marcel, or Sen. Hollings and tell them my idea is a good
idea. As long as patches are available and I'm able to apply them, I will
grumble under my breath and move on. That's my vote for a solution to the
kb25 merge problem, accept that a decision has been made and move on.

  I spent half of the weekend with a small child who asked his other to
let him do something. His mother said no, and instead of doing any of the
other things available to him, the spent the afternoon, evening, and
following morning asking his siblings, aunts and uncles, and grandparents
to tell his mother why he should be allowed to do that particular thing. 
As a result he wasted his time, didn't do anything fun in that time, and
pissed off his mother to no end. 

  I shouldn't wonder if Linus hasn't heard all he wants on this, he is
certainly willing to enter a dialong when he feels discussion is useful.
if I were pushing this change I might read something into that and not
flagellate this particular deceased equine.
