Hello,
As a part of the bigger project being developed in DGT-LAB (the NETX), I 
have written a HDLC driver for our proprietary Motorola MPC860T-based 
board. We are not going to integrate this software with the main Linux 
source tree, but this software is released under GPL as a loadable 
module for 2.4.18 Linux kernel. The current version is a mature test 
version.
The sources and documentation are available at:
<http://www.dgt-lab.com.pl/Serwis/mpc860hdlc.tar.gz>
If you have any questions or suggestions please contact me:
