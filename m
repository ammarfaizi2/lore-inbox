AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS UNIT 
UNION BANK OF TOGOLEISE UNION
BANK HOUSE,LOME- TOGO. 

Good day, 

I am Mr.Dan Musa. A staff of bills and exchange at
the foreign remittance Department, of Union Bank Of Togolise
plc. 

I am writing following the impressive information
about you from our chambers of commerce and industry.In my
department, we discovered an abandoned sum of (US$ 5m)
FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS only, in an account that
belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with
his entire family in November 1999 in a plane crash. 
Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money
because we cannot release it unless somebody applies as a
next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our
banking guidelines. 

Unfortunately we learn that his supposed next of kin or
relations died along with him at the crash leaving nobody
behind! for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery
that I and other officials in the department now decided to
make business with you, that is, to release the money to
you as the next of kin or relation to the decease since
nobody is fronting for the money and we do not want this
fund to go into disbursement account as unclaimed bill. The
banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such
money remained unclaimed after six years the money will be
transferred into federal government account as unclaimed
fund. 

The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business
is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a
foreigner and an indigene can not stand as a next of kin to
a foreigner. We agreed that 30% of this money will be for
you as the foreign partner and 10% for expenses incurred
during the cost of remittance. Therefore to enable
immediate transfer of the fund to you as arranged, you
should contact me with my e-mail address for further information. 

I look forward to hear from you. Please Include your phone
and fax numbers when repling. 

Waiting for your urgent reply via my private email:dmusa5@swissonline.ch.

Best regards
 
Mr.Dan Musa.
Foreign Remittance.
