Hi,

OK - I don't know if any of this helps, but I guess a little more 
precision won't do anyone any harm.
Intel i820 Chipset on P3C-D mobo.
ide0: BM-DMA at 0xa800-0xa807, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
hda: ASUS DVD-ROM E616, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hda: ATAPI 48X DVD-ROM drive, 512kB Cache, UDMA(33)

ide1: BM-DMA at 0xa808-0xa80f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:pio
hdc: RICOH CD-R/RW MP7060A, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hdc: ATAPI 24X CD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, DMA

Now hda is the one that bogs out, ripping silence after the "cdrom:
dropping to single frame dma" error. hdc can rip for hours and hardly 
ever get cdparanoia errors - even on "problematic" CDs that would appear 
to be a declenching factor for the single frame dma switch for hda.

Don't know what other info might be useful - attached is config file if 
that's of any interest.

Kind regards,

Phil
