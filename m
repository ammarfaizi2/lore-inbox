Well, of course not.  I think however the post gets into an issue I 
would normally expect some maintainer to take an interest in, in some 
form.  Of course, I may not have written it in such a way as to make 
that very easy, although I tried.

Thanks for the clarification.

I happen to be running 2.4.20, but from what I can see, nothing appears 
to have changed that would affect this issue in 2.5.x.


In any case, it appears I'll have to rephrase and try again.... ;)
