non properly. Caesar, ad example, was able to notice how similar were
galli and britanni as a common people, so that he was considering them in
the de bello gallico, as mutch related as latini and romani, or umbri and
romani. On the other side, he was noticing how different they were from
germani (both alemanni, and goti from whom longobardi, who ten lived in
actual sudeti, and during high medium aevum in norther Italy, lombardia,
being my ancients if it is trues that: germani cui brevitas nostra
contemptui est), and helvetii.

Sometimes it is difficult to remember that english, as european, have a
similar education at school like us, and so they develop a tendence in
ancient past.

Do you still study latin and greek at high school like us?
