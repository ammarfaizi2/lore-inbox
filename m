Compiling isdn.o as a module I've got this error :

depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.5.41/kernel/drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn.o
depmod:         eth_header

Compiling into the kernel is fine.

Compiling hisax as a module I've got this error :

drivers/isdn/hisax/config.c: In function `checkcard':
drivers/isdn/hisax/config.c:1176: structure has no member named `sync'
make[3]: *** [drivers/isdn/hisax/config.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [drivers/isdn/hisax] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/isdn] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2

Commented out that line is fine.

modprobing hisax type=18 protocol=2 I've got the attached oops

I'm using a vanilla RH 7.3 whit the attached kernel config

thanks in advance,
luca
