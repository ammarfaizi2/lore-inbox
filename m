I'd say that's covered pretty much by the FAQ, section 3, point 23.:

23. Why don't you split the list, such as having one each for the
development and stable series?

(REG, by "hacksaw") It's true that the lkml is a high traffic list and
can be a lot to handle. However, splitting the list wouldn't help, since
most developers would just subscribe to both lists. In fact, there would
then be extra traffic, because of the number of issues that hit both the
development and stable kernels, or even farther back!
