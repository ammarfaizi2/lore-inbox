hi ya

we can build an 8-drive ( 120GB at $200ea )  or ( 160GB at $300>? each )
1U box...about 0.960 - 1.28 TB each backup server ( 1U ) for under $2,500 in parts
+  cost of raid setup/testing is up to the user
	- am thinking the 1.6TB of storage for 10K lira(?) is too much

i prefer disks to backup data.. so that its always a semi-warm backup
( tapes have always been way tooo slow to find a file and to restore 

have fun
