Intel will not release docs for SpeedStep, so we cannot do anything
about this except annoy Intel (or buy competing, documented processors).

I have a Toshiba P-III laptop with SpeedStep.  It was similarly slow
until I got into the BIOS setup screen and cranked up the BIOS settings
from "max saving" to "max performance."

(BTW, most laptops -do- have a BIOS setup... it's just that many
manufacturers hide the normal PC boot screen, where RAM is checked, IDE
drives scanned, etc)
