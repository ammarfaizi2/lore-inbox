Hi,

 I tried to compile linux-2.4.5ac17 with processor type "Athlon"
 settings.

 Compilation/Install was successful. But boot produces dozens of
 "unresolved symbols" if trying to insmod any of the modules.

 Not one module was insmodded successfully.

 I tried PENTIUM III setting, which works fine.
 
 What's goiing on here ;-)

 What is it, what I am doing wrong.

 The modutils version is 2.4.6

 Any help VERY welcone ;-)
 Thank you very much in advance !

   keep hacking the right site of life ! :-)
  Meino
