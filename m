hi

I'm sorry if this is OT in LKML, but I've tried searching around, and
couldn't find anything.

I have this set-top box with a National Semiconductor Geode SC1200 chip
with a built-in watch-dog plus a lot more.

Does anyone know if there is any support for the sc1200-specific features
in the current kernels, or if there are patches available?

thanks

roy
