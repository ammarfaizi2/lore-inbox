Quoted from the GPL:
-------
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
-------

Your "ethical" statement is incompatible with the GPL.

(And, IMHO, unethical since it restricts the freedom of
use on free software, but lets not start about that since
we're off-topic for linux-kernel anyway...)

regards,

Rik
