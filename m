Any idea if installing this break a redhat-8 kernel upgrade?  I
updated modutils some time ago and it does not seem very happy
with 2.4 kernels now.  I was using RPMs because I want to keep
the package manager informed about which packages are installed.
Perhaps there was a problem with the way the RPMs were made rather
than the tools.

Thanks,

Jim
