What I'll do is take this and some of stuff sent to me privately
(spelling correction, peer review stuff) and update that.  I will
probably reword your intro here.

A README in that dir might not be a bad idea, but it (like the other
docs) will actually be useful.  It will include the "BK disclaimer" as
well as other stuff.
