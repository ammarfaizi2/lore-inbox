The "we'll turn it on in February" warning is worth NOTHING in this
situation: February comes and goes. March comes and goes. Everybody
who read the warning will think: Ok, so I must be fine.

A warning of the form: "ECN will go on as soon as this message clears
the queues" would've been useful, as thousands (hundreds?) suddenly get
nothing anymore.
