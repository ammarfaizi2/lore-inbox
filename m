Hi all,

BrrrrrrrrrrrrBrrrr

That was me blowing my own trumpet again :-)

Re:

Now just hit 1500 days:

-
[nick@486Linux nick]$ last -xf /var/run/utmp runlevel
runlevel (to lvl 3)                    Sun Oct 14 16:07 - 21:41 (1502+06:34)

utmp begins Sun Oct 14 16:07:40 2001

Utterly remarkable - the box gets no maintenance at all.

I would love to know how much data it has delivered, but alas, in 2001 I 
wasn't up-to-speed with that sort of thing :-)

Nick
