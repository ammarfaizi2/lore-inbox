Nowdays there are two free implementations of X, the xfree group and the 
xorg group. In addition there are (or were as recently as a couple years 
ago) multiple commercial companies who write and sell X server software.

if you are leveling accusations about what a group does or doesn't care 
about you need to at lease devine who you are accusing, anything less _is_ 
just a troll
