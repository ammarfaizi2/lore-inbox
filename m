Those informations came from an article printed on Linux&C just 6 days
before the one on "affari e Finanza", written by A frined of mine, Felice
Mainolfi. Nothing wrong to take informations from another article,
(it takes also the same words), the final use of those true informations
is deprecable (to title after a page "and also Us will be open" about
M$ open source policy).
