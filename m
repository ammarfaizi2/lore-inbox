      This is the Linux-kernel list. It deals with
      Linux-kernel issues. It does not deal with
      your continual attempt to claim some sort of
      credit for the work of thousands. You should
      take your bottle and go back to sleep. Nobody
      in the industry, except those who have been
      bamboozled by you, think of Linux as GNU/Linux,
      a term you fraudulently coined and published
      in an attempt to claim what has never been yours.

Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
