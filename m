+	  doesn't require APM.  You may suspend your machine by 'swsusp'
+	  or 'shutdown -z <time>' (with the appropriate patch for sysvinit).
+
+	  The suspend procedure will create an image that is saved in one
+	  of your active swap partitions (swap files are not supported).
+
+	  On the next boot, passing the kernel boot option
+	  'resume=/path/to/your/swap/partition' will cause the kernel

+	  boot option.  However, note that in this case your partitions
+	  will appear to be damaged and you will need to re-mkswap.
+
+	  You are not advised to boot without resuming and then resume
+	  later.  There is a high probability that buffers on disk won't
+	  match with the saved ones.
+
+	  SMP is NOT supported at this time.
