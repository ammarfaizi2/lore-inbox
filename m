Hi,

perhaps my question is unusual, but why do you not clean up the older Linux
Kernels?

The Kernel 2.0.39 is the last stable one, but there is also a 2.0.40-rc6. So
why not releasing it as stable 2.0.40 (final)? And Alan Cox isn't active any
more for some time and the ac-Patches are very old. They could be removed,
or not?

:)

Bye
Thomas
