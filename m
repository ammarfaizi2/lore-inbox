And - last but not least:

5. Interrupts - perhaps try to remove everything from your computer,
except gfx, cpu, ram, and ide drives (hdds and dvd, not cd). But I think
of this as a last resort.

6. Related to 5 - I would also check DVD with different hardware or/and
with different OS - just to be sure. If it's not working then perhaps it
is faulty. Or your motherboard, maybe.
