I was working on Mandrake 8.0 Linux 2.4.8, which was precompiled, sorry. I 
don't even have the sources for their kernel. I try replacing it all with 
the latest kernel, then I'll see...
It was just about the compression, I can't help with this kernel. I'll try 
out the latest khttpd when I got so far.

Regards,
Thunder
