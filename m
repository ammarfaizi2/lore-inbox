Actually, this is a kick ass idea.  How many hotmail addresses on lkml?
This will definitely get the point across.  They don't seem to get it from
the email I received.  It should have read "Oh, we know about this, but in
order for us to do something, we'd actually have to do work and like
upgrade things and that's a drag.  We'd rather watch Benny Hill reruns and
throw snot balls at our enterprise solutions all day" or something to that
effect.

What's funny is I spent two days thinking my segment was banned from
hotmail for some totally unknown reason before the whole ECN thing popped
into my head.
