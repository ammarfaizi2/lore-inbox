Hi all,
At our school, we have a installed Fedora Core 1 on a machine which acts as a 
server. Our students may store reports and other products, that they have 
created for their lessons, on this machine. Also the teachers have an 
account.
 
I would like the teachers to have list access on ALL directories. Just as the 
root user has. I wouldn't like the teachers to have all root permissions, but 
they should only be able to list ALL directories available. Viewing only, no 
writing.
 
Any idea how I can achieve this?
 
Thanx,
Alex
