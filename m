I don't entirely follow these sorts of discussion, but this vaguely
disagrees with what I've heard in some nitpicky way. I believe it goes
something along the lines of absorbing more distro content on the
grounds that some of the larger variances of distro kernels have been
detrimental in the past or some such.

This is clearly economics and HCI; I'll refrain from comment myself but
hope someone knowledgable there chimes in, as this likely needs
qualification.
