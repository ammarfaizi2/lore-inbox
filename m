Not in the case of this license.

Do a google search on "fully integrated agreement" and "parol evidence 
rule".

Only if you haven't got a fully integrated agreement. If you do, they'd 
never appear in court. If you look at the license, you'll note it has a 
merger clause ("This License represents the complete agreement between You and BitMover 
regarding the BitKeeper Software covered by this License.").
I'm sure it's there specifically so the parol evidence rule applies 
completely.
