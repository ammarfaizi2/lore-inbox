Hi!

It's a freshly downloaded linux-2.5.4.tar.bz2. The usual make oldconfig 
dep clean bzImage:

make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1

It looks like <asm/processor.h> needs to #include <linux/sched.h> somewhere
as drawn is "schedh-after.ps.gz". Config is attached.

<nothumorous>
The compilation certainly finishes sooner after the "sched.h cleanup".  ;-)
