    So, would you still recomend the purchase of such a card? (I
    wouldn't hesitate for REM56G-100BTX but laptop comes with RBEM56G

Don't buy Xircom.

Xircom has be swallowed by Intel, who have a funny attitude when it
comes to helping linux especially with networking products.  I have
Xircom cards at present, and they more-or-less work, but I certainly
won't buy another.
