And it is the to-be-expected way for all companies/corporations/
commercial entities where none-techies are the decision makers (the
condition is a sufficient one but not a necessary one) - ethics and/or
fairness are pretty irrelevant there if there seems to a problem with
sales, stakeholders value, bonuses of management and especially the
deciders themselves etc.
Yes, that may be rude. Sorry, that is reality.

In one word: It will doubtless go that way because only short-term
"success" is relevant (i.e. just to get as much money as possible out of
it *now*) and the devil may care ....
