The problem is they want an entire list of every piece of intellectual
property I have or own.  This is a means to claim anything else I do is
derived off their IP and they own it.  This will not happen.

Some other poor bastard can sign their NDA's to write their drivers.

Right, I count the number of fingers I have before and after I shake hands
with the folks in their camp.  If I get an extra, I feel sorry for the
poor bastard who was there before me.

I still have 4 fingers and 1 thumb on each hand, and I plan to keep it
that way.

Hogwash, they dominate the market space and are on all the Intel
Mainboards that are 845e and above.
