Subject: APIC problem on 2.5.47 SMP noapic

Hello all,

i have just downloaded the last version of the linux kernel available on
kernel.org.

I configured the kernel for SMP support and compiled it with a "make
bzImage". I made then the necessary changes on lilo.conf, making sure I
added "noapic" to the boot parameters (I already have a 2.4.18 and it
won't boot otherwise).

When booting, and before the INIT, I have the following message on
screen for a while :

	APIC error on CPU1: 40(40)

After the INIT, i have slightly the same but endlessly looped (what is
most annoying):

	APIC error on CPU1: 08(08)

The INIT sequence never ends and all I can do is a cold restart.

I thought the "noapic" option at boot should do the trick but this
didn't worked somehow.

I also patched the 2.5.47 to the last one i found (patch-2.5.47-bk6,
Nov. 17) but I had no Improvements.

My cfg is the following:
2x p3 933, 512 SDRAM, MB Asus CUV4xD, Award Bios v6.0 (release 1010)
(tried with MPS 1.4 support enabled/disabled).

Herewith the dmesg of the working 2.4.18 for more info.
Also the .config of the 2.5.47

It's always possible that i haven't done google enough but if this is
just a parameter, could someone point me in the right direction?

Thanks In advance.

Pedro Mullor
