  For past 5+ days VGER has been unable to connect any MX server
  of your domain.  Why ?  I have no idea.  Diagnostics says:
  "connection timed out".

  Somebody has tweaked a firewall there, and is now rejecting
  connections with TCP/ECN ?

  Use  http://vger.kernel.org/mxverify.html  tool to see how things
  are working.
