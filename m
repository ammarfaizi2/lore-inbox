No, not at all:
	mo·nop·o·ly
	Function: noun
	1 : exclusive control of a particular market that is marked by
	    the power to control prices and exclude competition and that
	    esp. is developed willfully rather than as the result of
	    superior products or skill.
	2 : one that has a monopoly

I think our "superior product and skill" is what makes us not a
monopoly :)

Besides, the *BSD developers routinely use our code to write their own
drivers (looking at how things are done) so in the end, having Linux
support a device helps them out too.  So the "exclude competition"
portion of the above definition is also false...
