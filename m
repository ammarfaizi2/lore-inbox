I'd like to announce a new mailing list that has been started up to
focus on adding support to Linux for hotplug memory.

As I personally know of at least 3 different groups at 3 different
companies working on this feature, and all of them don't seem to want to
talk together on linux-kernel or linux-mm, this list is for them, and
anyone else who wants to help.

Please everyone, work together and stop re-inventing the wheel...

Info on joining the list can be found at:
  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/linux-hotplug-memory

The list is open to any posters (subscription not required), and no HTML
messages are allowed on it.  The address is:
  linux-hotplug-memory@lists.sourceforge.net

If anyone has any questions or problems with the list, please let me
know.

thanks,

greg k-h
