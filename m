Members of Project UDI today announced the release of the UDI (Uniform
Driver Interface) 1.0 Specification. This Specification is the
culmination of a multi-company development effort designed to provide
device driver portability for existing and future system configurations.
UDI supports today's key I/O technologies and is designed with an
extensible architecture that can easily accommodate future I/O
technologies and products.
