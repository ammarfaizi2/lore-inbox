Sorry, Tom about the word doc faux pas.  I've set out my problem in plain
text below.  I got my source from ftp.kernel.org.

Here's my problem:



Problem in compiling linux 2.4.3

Compile error message:

After the compiler message:

    gcc ­D__KERNEL__ -I/home/jeff/kernel/linux/include ­Wall
­Wstrict-prototypes ­O2 ­fomit-frame-pointer ­fno-strict-aliasing
­D__powerpc__ -fsigned-char ­msoft-float ­pipe ­ffixed-r2 ­Wno-uninitialized
­mmultiple ­mstring    -c ­o fork.o fork.c

Compiler error message:

fork.c: In function Œcopy_mm¹:
fork.c:353: fixed or forbidden register 68 (0) was spilled for class
CR0_REGS.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm statements or
clauses.
