Hi,

I've been working my way through what I think is probably the seminal 
work on the topic of device drivers, but it pre-dates ioctl32 and other 
32 compatibility stuff.

(The O'Reilly linux device driver book)  
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/ch03.html

Is there anywhere that I can find some more information on this, such as 
a howto?  I've been googling but have only really stumbled across some 
brief info on lwn.net.

Thanks :)

James
