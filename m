I double-checked AP-485 (24161823.pdf, the "real" reference to CPUID),
and it says (section 3.4) that SEP is unsupported when the signature
as a whole is less that 0x633. This means all PPros, and PII Model 3s
with steppings less than 3.

The problem is that the kernel check you quoted above is buggy: the
c->x86_model < 3 && c->x86_mask < 3 part fails for late-stepping PPros
since c->x86_mask >= 3 for them. The test should be rewritten as:

        if (c->x86 == 6 && (c->x86_model < 3 ||
                            (c->x86_model == 3 && c->x86_mask < 3)))
                clear_bit(X86_FEATURE_SEP, c->x86_capability);
