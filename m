Hello Friend.
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe
everyone will die someday. My name is Abdul Karim, a merchant in Dubai, in
the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer . It has defiled all
forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to
live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money
in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want
God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms
to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I
do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations
in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so
badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to
close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the
money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to
be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no
one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty million united states
dollars  that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you
to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to
charity organizations. I have set aside 10 % for you and for your time.

God be with you.
Regards,
Abdul Karim
