What is the goal of the BitBucket project, though?

To develop a version control system, or to annoy Larry?

I haven't seen a single post to the list saying, "If we were designing
a version control system dedicated to the Linux kernel, what would you
like to see in it?".  Before I started work on my bug database, I
spent a week or so discussing it on the list with people.

Why doesn't somebody start working on a dedicated kernel version
control system?

John.
