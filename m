i would like to suggest a graphical way to setup and install the
kernel and kernel components, this would make it easier for idiots
like myself to install the kernel with more ease and could solve this
issue of 'bloating'. Making a graphical kernel installer could make it
easier for people to select exactly what they want in their kernel, i 
have no idea if this is even remotely possible because im quite the
noob when it comes to compiling stuff on linux but if it is that could
be a good idea
