I have finally produced something resembling a formal definition of the
phase tree algorithm.  As you will see, this algorithm is somewhat
subtle, and not easy to express in clear simple terms.  But I think that
I have in fact expressed it clearly in simply.  If I have not, I wish
very much to be told so, and why.

You can get a copy here:

Please, if you are especially anal and nasty and have little regard for
anyone's feelings, read this and complain about every little thing that
is wrong with it, and I will greatly appreciate that.  I will also
appreciate comments of the form 'you left out this or that', or 'this
part sounds like so much bafflegab' and so on.

Enjoy.
