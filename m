Hi,

	I got this while trying to mount /dev/hdc without ide-cd loaded,
while it was auto-loading and with no CD on the CD unit.

ksymoops 2.4.3 on i686 2.4.19-pre3-ac5.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.19-pre3-ac5/ (default)
     -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)

Warning: You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will
assume that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running
right now and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
