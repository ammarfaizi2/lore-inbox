	I do not have skipping, but if I play short samples eg. less than two 
seconds, I get same sample repeated abot 7-8 times. Longer ones play OK 
except last sec or two, than last two seconds which are repeated same way as 
short samples.

	This is happening since 2.5.59, but not in 2.5.52. 2.5.53-2.5.58 not tested.
