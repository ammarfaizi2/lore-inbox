People in general *don't* understand the current so-called "established  
practice", because not only is it inconsistent with all of the rest of the  
world, it's also inconsistent with itself.

A few specialists such as you or me understand those terms in those few  
areas we are familiar with.

Do you know of *any* case where KiB and friends have been applied  
inconsistently? You may not be arguing the side you seem to want to be  
arguing here ...

I have no idea why you think it is impossible to get right. It is fairly  
easy to get right. Of course, that means using different numbers, but then  
I've been saying for more than a decade that those numbers are a lie.
