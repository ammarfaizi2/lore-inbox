this is nothing to do with spam; that's not the only form of abuse that
exists.

Perhaps you also missed the point from my first message that a) I don't
intentionally receive the linux.* groups and therefore had not previously
needed to consider whether they were getting binaries and b) that I stopped
as soon as this was drawn to my attention. (I did already have in place
exemptions for all the generally-known binaries hierarchies.)
