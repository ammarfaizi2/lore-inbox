chip: athlon 1700 XP
mb: ep-8kha+
memory: 256M ddr
dist: slackware 8.0
gcc: version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)
(ask me if I forgot anything that might help)

I've looked around trying to find the problem in old lists, websites, 
newsgroups etc, and cannot find an explaination at all.  I've found 
information about dual athlons and problems, but nothing about single 
athlons.

The problem is this, when I try to use the 2.4 or 2.5 series kernels, 
the machine is incredibley slow.  When using the 2.2 series kernels I 
have no problem at all.

With 2.4 kernels I have tried compiling with the CPU type set as Athlon 
and also set as 486.  Both compilations have the same problem running 
very slowly.

I've attached my .config files for both the 2.2 and 2.4 kernels that I 
have tried recently.

If you even have an idea of where I should start looking I'd appreciate 
it.  Thanks.

Aaron
