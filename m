Forgive me if I missed any points earlier in the list since I am not a
frequent reader here.

As a dumb end user I DO need people to tell me which .x version in
2.6.x series is STABLE.

I understand it is important to get new features in as
soon as possible, but it is same important that we end users could
sleep well with the version running on our systems.

If every 2.6.x version is so solid then I wouldn't say anything, but I
am afraid it is not true. I think it still very important to
distinguish between _bug_fix_ release and _feature_devel_ release,
being it
2.6.x vs 2.7.x, or
2.6.x.1 vs 2.6.x+1, or
2.6.x vs 2.6.x+1-pre/-rc/-mm

I am optimistic that this issue could be settled down fairly easily by
such an open development process.

Sincerely,

A dumb end user
