One thing the SSSCA people must consider here is security impact. If a 
document can be traced through its users then the ability of agencies to
work against organised crime will be crippled. The SSSCA appears to have no
provision to allow the FBI to remove watermarks, and makes it illegalf or
other people to be subcontracted to write the tools

Goodbye corporate whistleblowers, goodbye FBI plants in organised crime 
bodies..
