Hello,

Anybody know how to enable hyperthreading? I
have an ABIT IC7-G motherboard (absolute garbage)
with a Phoenix AwardBIOS. They don't provide
any BIOS upgrades and say you have to contact
the board vendor. ABIT doesn't answer email
and www.abit.com ends up being answered by
www.motherboards.com that doesn't provide
any support.

The crap board came with the peripherals
I paid for, stripped out (no network, etc).
Don't make the mistake of buying this garbage
as I did. I thought that since it was more
expensive than others, it __must__ be the
best!!!

Cheers,
Dick Johnson
