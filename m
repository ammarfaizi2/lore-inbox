Richard, I just cut & pasted this from your attachment:

"Please note that the directory structure on ftp.gnu.org was
 redisorganzied fairly recently, such that there is a directory for each
 program.  One side effect of this is that if you cd into the gnu
 directory, and do
 > ls emacs*
 you will get a list of all the files in the emacs directory, but it will
 not be obvious from the ls output that you have to `cd emacs' before you
 can download those files."
