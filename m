Oh, come now, Dave; be nice! This is fun stuff.

A voice synthesizer would be even better than morse code.

"I'm sorry Dave. I can't boot."

Think Hal 9000, from 2001/2010! The kernel could detect a sound card at
boot, and then tell us what broke. Very 22nd century, if you ask me.

If sound is broken or nonexistent, we could fall back to Morse! Or electric
shocks via a serial connection! The possibilities are endless.
