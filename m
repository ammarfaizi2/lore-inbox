As you might already know, after the interviews to Mingo I assumed, that a
major portion of the achievements was enabled by the 2.4 scalability
enhacements. That is why I wrote to LKML, to ask about the 2.4
scalability, if anybody out there could tell us about the linux kernel's
scalability possibily compared to W2k scalability...
