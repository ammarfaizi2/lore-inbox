decided to  invest these money in your country or anywhere safe  enough 
outside the  country for security and political reasons.We want  you to 
help us to  transfer this fund to your country for investment  purposes 
on the  followings below:  If you can be of an  assistance to us I will 
be  pleased to offer you 20% Of the total fund. 
 
It is very 
important  that you forward to me your full name ,your private
