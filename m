I've had problems with hwscan ever since I started testing 2.5 on a
Suse system. I ended up deactivating it. Doesn't make any sense if the hardware
doesn't change and you boot faster :-)
The kernel shouldn't bork though.
Unfortunately it would appear that the source for hwscan is not available.
I reported this to (German) Suse back in June.
