Linus, 

I sure hope that you're talking about "finishing" your project plan,
and not about "starting it". I would really prefer to have work on
the IDE-TNG started soonish, rather than defered another year or so.

There will be plenty of bugs to be found, which can benefit from a
longer testing-period by people daring enough to try the new and
experimental driver.....
