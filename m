Greetings;

kernel 2.6.8-rc2-mm2, kde3.3-beta2.

Now that it appears I'm stable again, I am asking if the memory data 
that kpm and ksysguard use has been moved recently?

Both utils are now showing long strings of 8888888888 in the bottom 
lines of their windows now, for everything thats normally there.

Cheers, Gene
