just in case there's somebody on this list who *doesn't* use google

"Brin and Page were the first to recognize that this adaptability could
be harnessed through massively parallel pecking to solve complex
problems, such as ordering large datasets or ordering pizza for large
groups of engineers. Page and Brin experimented with numerous avian
motivators before settling on a combination of linseed and flax (lin/ax)
that not only offered superior performance, but could be gathered at no
cost from nearby open space preserves. This open space lin/ax powers
Google's operations to this day, and a visit to the data coop reveals
pigeons happily pecking away at lin/ax kernels and seeds."

-Bryan [using lin/ax as happily as a google pigeon]
