In my view a great number of things are legal which I consider unethical.  
I believe Larry has made his position fairly clear and has attempted to 
construct his license language to implement that plain-spoken intent.  
Whether or not people agree with the stated position, I doubt there is 
anyone who doesn't understand it.  Why not just do the clearly right thing 
and abide by that?
