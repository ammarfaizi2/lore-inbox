Dear Friends,

I want to read CPU Usage like top command.

What I want is read CPU usage for particular user log in.

Say x,y and z are logged in and they are running separate applications.

What I want is to get the CPU usage of each user separately.

It would be somewhat like top command, but then top gives CPU usage of the 
machine as a total.

Can anyone help me with giving me any clue about C apis in Linux.

Or if I can get the source code of top command.

Thanks
