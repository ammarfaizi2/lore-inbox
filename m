The Problem is while configuring the Parallelport and saving the changes.


It's only by change 'PCI - Support'
Including the 'PCMCIA - Support'
In Section 'ParallelPort' (PCMCIA-Parallelport-Support)
You must set 'PC-Style' of 'm' to disabeln this error.
But i want PC = y and PCMCIA-Parallel = n.

I don't know what is it.
Think a failor in configuration script.

Smilie
