As a sidenote, this transfer of intellectual property of code is not
doable, according to French law (and other non-anglo-saxon countries).
In France, the author of a an "intellectual production" cannot give
away this authorship; all he can give is the ability to reproduce,
reuse and redistribute his work.

However, this intellectual property, which is eternal (it does not stop
with the death of the author, and yet may not be transfered to other
people even in such an occurence), is not bound by any scriptural glyph
such as '(c)'. I can add '(c) Free Software Fundation' in all my source
files, and they will remain mine.

So, where I live, the point is moot.
