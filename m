In the US, copyright law's definitive use of "distribution" says that
"to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the
public by sale or other stranfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or
lending" is a right reserved to the copyright owner.  Saying "it's
only a loan" or "it's only temporary" does not relieve any obligation
under the GPL.  I would imagine that law across the EU is similar.
