Hmm, I wasn't really clear here. I think that after using BK, you
shouldn't be able to work on another SCM until 2 years have past. But you
can shorten that time by paying bitmover 1/12 of a BK license for each
month you want to shorten it. That covers the problem of people needing to
switch, they just have to pay. Then the following applies:
