You cut off this part from Ingo Molnar :

Is it  true ? The legal  issue around is quite  difficult to calculate
and generate a classical problem of exclusion around the four freedoms
of Free Software. (and so the GNU General Public License)

In  that case,  your proprietary  software cannot  be used  to produce
Free Software  licensed under the  GNU General Public License.   As in
#6: "You  may not impose  any further restrictions on  the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein." 

If  the  case  explained  by  Ingo  Molnar,  you  are  adding  further
restrictions. (in the case of  the Linux Kernel, they are contributors
(so  also  recipients  of  the  rights  of the  GNU  GPL)  using  your
proprietary software  license to produce Free  Software licensed under
GNU GPL)

If this is correct, this is an important issue. 

Maybe we should forward the issue to the FSF for clarification ? 

Thanks.
