There are a large number of things that need to be done
for the kernel. ;))

If you are looking for a project which is relatively
easy, helps you learn a lot about the kernel and has
a bunch of friendly people who can help you, I have
a few URLs for you:


A website, mailing list and irc channel to help you
learn about the kernel. You can always find a few
kernel hackers here, too...
	http://kernelnewbies.org/


A project that maintains a list of possible bugs in
the kernel and then goes around searching through the
kernel to see where else they happen:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernel-janitor/

Rik
