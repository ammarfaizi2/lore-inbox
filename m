I think there are some other people, like regular gnomemeeting users=20
judging from that mailing list, that would have some interest in forming a=

team of sorts to maintain the driver. At least, I am, for myself, if=20
nobody else is interested. Perhaps some other webcam driver developers=20
want to help out a bit, too. Many people use this driver. I'm also willing=
=20
to write a simple patch script that would install the (out-of-tree) driver=
=20
in a kernel tree without requiring too much user knowledge or=20
intervention, if Nemosoft would decide to release his last code.

But let's give it a few days of rest and find out what Nemosoft thinks.
