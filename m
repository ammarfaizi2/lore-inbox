No, you misunderstand. It says you have to include the appropriate 
copyright notice in order to distribute it. "Appropriate copyright notice" 
means "Copyright from ALL copyright holders", because that's the 
"appropriate" thing to do. Failure to include all copyright notices is 
plagiarism and you can be sued for that.

Blah blah blah. It clearly states that you have to include the appropriate 
copyright notices. As I stated before, "appropriate" means "ALL of them" 
in this case.

Blah blah blah. Go do your homework and stop arguing about something you 
don't understand.

Start by visiting the following URL: 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

The license in question is an hybrid between "The modified BSD license" 
and "The X11 license". No additions were made, just inserted something  
 from one license into the other. All insertions are therefore GPL 
compatible.


=====
The modified BSD license. http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5
(Note: on the preceding link, the modified BSD license is listed in the 
"General" section.)

This is the original BSD license, modified by removal of the advertising 
clause. It is a simple, permissive non-copyleft free software license, 
compatible with the GNU GPL.

If you want a simple, permissive non-copyleft free software license, the 
modified BSD license is a reasonable choice. However, it is risky to 
recommend use of ``the BSD license'', because confusion could easily occur 
and lead to use of the flawed original BSD license. To avoid this risk, 
you can suggest the X11 license instead. The X11 license and the revised 
BSD license are more or less equivalent.
=====


=====
The X11 license. http://www.x.org/Downloads_terms.html
This is a simple, permissive non-copyleft free software license, 
compatible with the GNU GPL. XFree86 uses the same license. This is 
sometimes called the "MIT" license, but that term is misleading since MIT 
has used many licenses for software.
