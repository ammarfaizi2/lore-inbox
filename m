I don't know for sure.  In the past week or two I saw two
OOPS-with-tainted-kernel posts, and in both cases the user was able to
reproduce the problem with an untainted kernel.  But that was not my
point, I should have used a better example.

I don't, see above.  But, this is offtopic.

Eh, I wouldn't call them lusers, posting an OOPS is complicated for a
non-geek, you can't expect everyone to get it 100% right the first time.

I meant that the number of people using the nvidia driver was way more
than I would have thought.  There are a *lot* of people gaming on Linux
these days, I had no idea.  This is great.
