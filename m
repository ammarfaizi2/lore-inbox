To do not produce megabytes of additional traffic in case of any
kind of backlog and have anything you lkml like, i would suggest to have
good news reader and point it to news.gmane.org service (well, i'm
sure, there are many who have lkml->news scheme privately).

In your case, to download mbox with messages you've requested, i
would request 1500-2000 headers, sort them by date, selected to download
messages from your lkml last "Message-Id" to first received one.

In slrn, (not optimal) selecting by date took me less than 5 minutes.

Just my 0.07 ;oE
