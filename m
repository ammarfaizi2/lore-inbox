Hmmm... this is the kernel list... not only the wrong place to ask UI
questions, but lots of people here don't even like UIs. :)

Subject: Common GUI Config for All Users

from one source (for easy administration).

> Found copying my /root/.gnome & .sawfish directories to a user home breaks
the user's GUI, implying a symlink wouldn't work.  I am told .gnome &
.sawfish can be copied to /etc/skel to give common look for new users, but
need ongoing single-source control.  Besides, I tried copying root's config
files to skel & it broke user GUIs.
