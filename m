To all whom are interested: I posted my .config file and 
/proc/bus/usb/devices files to ftp://ranma.wox.org/devices.txt and 
ftp://ranma.wox.org/config.txt.  I forgot to check the kernel log, and 
I'm tired of recompiling kernels.  I had origionally planned to switch 
motherboards and cpus with my brother, as I was putting a new comp 
together for him but, out of frustration with my current dilemma, have 
decided to switch back (the amd seems unstable anyway).  Regardless, I 
will not be able to follow up on this bug report.  And to Johannes, no, 
I don't think I've ever even seen a BABBLE error, and I'm not sure what 
that is.
