I'm new to this list.  Does it get spammed often, like this guy
(grumph@pakistanmail.com) is doing?  It is allready becoming quite anouying!
This is by far the busiest list I have ever subscribed to, and there does
not seem to be any sort of spam blocker working here.  I thought Majodomo
had stuff like this built in?  If not maybe a list moderator could address
this.
