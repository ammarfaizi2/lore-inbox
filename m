I've been lurking lkml for a number of years, I follow most of what goes 
on here, and I don't pipe up often, but I'm trying to id a new system, and
I'm confused about all of the via chipset problems/issues talked about here
recently.

Simply put, what chipset(s) should I consider for purchase, or if the 
converse subset is smaller, what should I avoid?

I've searched and found nothing about the VIA VT8633 chipset, but a lot
about problematic VIA chipsets, so I'm wary.  Any feed back on this chipset
or, specifically the ASUS CUV266 motherboard?

thanks,
-chuck
