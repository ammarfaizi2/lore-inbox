 Dear Sir,
 
This is important, and requires your immediate attention! First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in the transaction.
 
To intimate you further, we are top officials of the new civilian administration Committee on Foreign and Local Contract Payment, who are interested in the importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to actualize this dream, we seek your assistance to transfer the said-trapped fund into an interest bearing account which you have absolute control over in your country or a third country other than Nigeria.

The new civilian administration of General Olusegun Obasanjo (rtd) set-up this committee specifically to review all contracts/oil licenses to determine their propriety and relevance in the light of the country's current economic and political realities. We have identified a lot of inflated contract fund which are currently floating in our Apex Bank. At this moment we have worked out modalities within ourselves and some acquaintances at the Apex Bank to divert the sum of US$33,700,000.00 (Thirty  three million,seven hundred thousand United States Dollars) only, for our personal use.

However, by virtue of our positions as Civil Servants and members of the Contract Review Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names, consequently, I was delegated by my colleagues as a matter of trust to look for an overseas partner into whose account we can transfer this sum of money,hence this letter to you.Furthermore, my colleagues and
