Oh, please not again a stable kernel series with NFS problems, we're
locked in for ages. 2.2 was bad enough up to 2.2.18. We have ReiserFS
in 2.4.1 (and not in 2.4.0), could we _please_ get NFS-exportable
ReiserFS in 2.4.4 or 2.4.5?

Yes, will test. :-) Though I won't touch any 2.4 release in production
up to at least 2.4.5 (first really usable 2.0 was around this, first
2.2 too. =:-)

	Regards
