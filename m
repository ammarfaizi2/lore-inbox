	Excuse me?  A 1 billion dolar investment in Linux is not supporting
it?  Setting up tier 1 and tier 2 support services for a half a dozen
distributions is not supporting it?  Porting their AIX file systems and
applications is not supporting it?  Porting it to the 390 is not supporting
it?  You bet'cha they are taking advantage of the fact that people want it.
They would be damn fools in business if they didn't take advantage of that.
And that means supporting it.  It's to their advantage to support it and
they see it.  You must have a really bizzare idea of what support means...
