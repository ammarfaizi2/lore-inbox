Why not run windows? Because linux does it better. It's nice to have a few 
desktops full of apps, then crank up Q3 or UT for a half hour to blow off 
steam, then close it and keep using the apps you had open. Maybe XP can do 
that these days, but the 9x's never could. And my son runs both XP and linux 
and he claims XP can't really support as many open apps as linux does and 
play a game at the same time and all the rest. I'll have to take his word 
since I'm linux only these days...

>From a users point of view, linux is starting to look good at the moment. They 
have a huge range of open source apps, plus they can easily run many games 
either ported or through winex/wine and they can even run MS Office and so 
forth through crossover/wine if they wish. They don't care about how they do 
it or what licence is involved or whether it's open source or whatever. They 
don't care that the video driver is closed. They certainly don't care that 
MSOffice is closed source... They just know "windows sucks, I might try 
linux".
