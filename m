  Have you ever tried to run a list with volumes like ours,
  and opennes (for posting) requirements like ours ?

  I have had some experience with those "more modern" beasts,
  and sure they are pretty with web-interfaces, but try to
  manage them thru that web-junk, when they have several
  thousand blocked junk messages to be discarded...

  We manage this thing with custom command-line utilities.
  In the early days there was no such a thing as "web", for
  example, and we really haven't seen anything so truly
  worthwhile in any new systems to warrant switching entire
  system over to them.  (And we have seen so much BAD in
  those eye-candy things that...)


  I sure may sound like "if it was good enough for your grandpa,
  it shall be good enough for you" -- but if one can't send email
  to the Majordomo (and manage to follow those basic instructions),
  perhaps they should not subscribe either...
