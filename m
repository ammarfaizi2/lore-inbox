I remember the time when kernel patches (at least for development
versions) where released without any changelogs most of the time.
It took some time to teach Linus that people really like changelogs ;-)

So missing changelogs are not the end of the world, and linux development
does work without them, it is only some wasted effort if every
interested developer has to analyse the code to find and understand the
changes.
