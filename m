I'm trying hard to stay out of this, I think Richard may be trolling,
but I need to make sure that people understand that what Richard is 
suggesting is violation of our license and copyright.

Our license states that you can't use BK if you are developing a similar
system, i.e., a clone.  Without using BK it's impossible to reverse
engineer BK to create the clone.  So your message seems to be saying
"it would be appropriate at this point to violate the BitKeeper license
in order to write a free client which talks with BitKeeper".

Are you really instructing people to go out and violate our license?
