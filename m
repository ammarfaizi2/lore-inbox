all,

=09I get a compile error on 2.5.31 when I enable CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND.

This is the error I get.

drivers/built-in.o: In function `acpi_system_suspend':
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x39a1e): undefined reference to `save_flags'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x39a4b): undefined reference to `restore_flags'

=09I noticed that the include/asm-i386 did not have the save_flags and=20
restore_flags macros while every other arch directory seems to have the=20
#define'd.

=09I have attached my .config.
