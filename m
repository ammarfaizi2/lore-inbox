The problem is that you will eventually lose data. No matter what the 
brand is. Some disks tend to work better for longer time. Sometimes you 
are just out of luck. With some brands, luck seems to be running out 
(Quantum). Other brands may work better, but they will eventually fail.

I've had failed Seagate, Maxtor, IBM, Fujitsu, Western Digital, Quantum, 
Conner.

The only brand which never failed that I use is Samsung (probably due to 
the fact that I only have 2 of them compared to the other brands).

I do expect them to fail and I have backups of the most important stuff I 
need.

The best I found for reliability (except for backups) is haveing a 
software raid 5 on many disks of about same capacity (but different 
brand/model).
