This was the subject of a discussion in Washington DC in the oval 
office during the signing of the Presidential Order by George Bush
validating our sovereign power in the US.  We have representation
through the United States Government, and I discussed this project
with the Federal head of Education for the United States in 
October when the Museum of the American Indian was dedicated in
Washington.  

I am confident President Bush will adequately represent our interests
at the UN.  All members of Linux are welcome to participate with us,
and since I am married to a German citizen who was just taken into
our Nation, you are welcome too Henning.  

Jeff

P.S.  I am traveling to Germany in March with my wife to visit her 
family. If you let me know where you are in Germany, I'll pop in 
for a visit.

:-)
