Hmmm... you aren't really taking about PAGs anymore, but no matter...

It looks like what you want is for there to be a user_struct and a
group_struct, each with a list of tokens.

A process would then have the set conjuction of the sets of tokens
corresponding to its EUID, EGID and GROUPS.

And you'd need to be able to do a "subset" operation too (ultimately producing
an empty set), if only to run another program with reduced authority.

That makes the situation more complicated, because you wouldn't necessarily
want all processes owned by a user to gain (even temporarily) a token loaned
from one process to another.

And then you have to have some method of prioritisation. You may find that
user dhowells has a token for (fs=AFS,cell=redhat.com) and group engineering
has a token for (fs=AFS,cell=redhat.com). Which do you use?

What's "MIS"?

OpenAFS does make it a useful and automatic PAM addition.

It can be used for other filesystems.

Fair enough. I'm unlikely to get security added to my AFS client before the
2.6 freeze.
