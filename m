I'm a little bit confused... a few weeks ago I read a thread regarding
the remove of some - unneeded ? - symbols from IEEE1394 core. Some
persons in the discussion told, that everything should be included into
kernel mainline, cause if not, symbols needed may be removed. 

Now here is the discussion about including FUSE into kernel... So WHAT?
In any case, I do not think that FUSE, compiled in as module, could
bother someone.
