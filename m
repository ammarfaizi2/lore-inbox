no, there is the only log I can find related in syslog, but I'v seen some kernel stack dump on the screen, 
and I havn't got chance to copy them out. I'm observing it now, if I repeat the error, I'll sent them.

yeah, that's what I thought too.

I guest so at present, but let me wait to see if I can repeat the problem later.

there are some other log messages in /var/log/debug, looks like:

but I think their are unrelevented here, because I think their are the normal log check after power failure.

> Can you try to run reiserfsck on a problematic partition and see

I've run it using command like :

#reiserfsck -x -o -l logfile /dev/sdc6

to all my partitions in linux, and  the `logfile' is empty, so may be I should observing to 
see if the problem could repeated and get more information.
BTW: if there another log helpful I can found, please inform me, I just checked `syslog',
`message' and `debug' in my system log directory.

    Thanks and Regards   Laser
