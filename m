I too ask where?

Seemingly yes by default.

The Ximian Evolution 1.2.2 here by default does style text "Normal" 
i.e. aggressively line broken only.  But the "Preformat" style works for
inline text patches such as my (: newly minted and beautiful but not yet
rejected for an explicit reason :) linux-scsi patches for making more
writable devices appear writable.

P.S.

This paragraph here now is an example of Evolution's Preformat style of English with which we can let the line of text go on and on and on as English so very easily does when written by people who haven't yet learned to limit the length of a sentence, or the length of an email, helpfully.
