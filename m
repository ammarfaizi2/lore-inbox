"Linux" is an operating system kernel.  By itself it is pretty
useless.
A thing which is Linux plus lots of libraries and utilities and maybe
a windowing system and a "desktop" is a lot more than "Linux".

It might be Redhat Linux, it might be SuSE Linux.  It might be
GNU/Linux.  It might be Debian GNU/Linux.  It might be KLX (referring
to KDE, Linux and The X11 Windowing System I think).  It might be
Ubuntu.  But isn't just "Linux".

It was never my understanding that RMS tried to rename the Linux
Kernel as GNU/Linux.  Rather he wanted to name the complete system
comprising Linux and some GNU software and X and anything else that
was free as "GNU/Linux".  I suspect he has more right than many to
suggest a name for the system seeing how much philosophy and
technology he has contributed.
