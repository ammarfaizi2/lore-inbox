i 'am a student learning linux
I compiled a module using gcc - 2.96 in 2.2.14 (from kernel.org release on redhat 7.1) and tried to insmod the module in a 
6.2 redhat with 2.2.14-22 kernel.
I have the following doubts
(i) It displays some 15 unresolved symbols
even for a change in kernel between 2.2.14 and 2.2.14-22

(ii) i repeated the above steps by compiling the module in kgcc ver 2.91
and now get only 6 unresolved symbols between
2.2.14 and 2.2.14-22.

As i 'am not subscribe to the list, please personally mark me a copy
can the experts help me in thi sregard
Thanks
bmm-sr
