Hi all,

I have a broken NTFS, due to my own mistake of mounting the
partition RW and moving a file instead of copying it....I've been poking
around for an NTFS editing tool; only to find that this is easier said
than done.  Does anyone have an NTFS repair tool for winnt 4 (I already
have the ddk), or any idea where I can find one?

thanks in advance!
