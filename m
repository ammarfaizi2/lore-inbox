Should we remove all mention of .com email addresses too?

On of the very few requirements of my job at mandrakesoft is to use
a mandrakesoft.com email address... as advertisement.  Many other
email addresses are used similarly.  reiserfs included _blatant_
advertisements in printk, for the sponsors of the code.  A ton of
other code has similar advertisements, though not at

Should we remove all advertisements from the kernel?  A Big Penguin
would probably object to the removal of this printk advertisement
for Swansea:

	Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.4
	Based upon Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039

If the answer is no, then you are targetting BitKeeper specifically...

The Linux kernel is not a commons.  Thankfully.  Linus prevents that.
Otherwise, we _would_ have the infamous Tragedy of the Commons.
