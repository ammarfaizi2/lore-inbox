David,

If you still have not paid and gotten legal advise on the position, you 
are still talking out of your ARSE.  Clearly you have horses and wishes
confused on what GPL is and is not.

If there is not boundary for modules then SCO will eat Linux alive in
court.  You can't have it both ways.

I am done with the subject, good day sir!
