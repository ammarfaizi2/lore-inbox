I think this is a very bad news.
In my opinion, the ACPI-patch is the most-needed kernel-patch at the moment. For many laptop-users that don't know about this patch, Linux is nearly unuseable. And I already know at least two desktop-pcs that don't have any power-management without the acpi-patch.
Andrew, I hope you can find a way to make a patch that the kernel-people will accept as soon as possible.
