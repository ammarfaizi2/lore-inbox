I'd just like to add that I respect Larry's problems regarding:

* small number of seats means large number of dollars per seat is 
necessary to justify the business investment

* people modifying the source to turn off open logging and thus 
defeating his original business model  (this would really piss me off also)

He is also an all around nice guy who has given us some nice tools, and 
tries hard to be generous while keeping his business alive.

I would like to see him try making his license such that if open logging 
is not used, and he is not paid a license fee, then the user has agreed 
that the software is GPL'd and any potential user may sue to claim that 
software.  I think this would scare managers into paying their fees, and 
I think it would work, but I also understand and respect that it is not 
my business that would go under if I was wrong, and it is not I who 
would have to explain to his workers why payroll couldn't be met.
