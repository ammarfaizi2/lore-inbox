Who told you the USA was a democracy? Never has, never will be. It is a
democratic republic. ENORMOUS difference.

I consider it supportive that someone outside the USA is "drawing the
line". The buck has to stop somewhere. The sooner the s*it hits the fan,
the better. The damage caused by excess corporate influence is one place
that needs a line drawn, and politicians willing to join in creating
collateral damage against their own people in some demented and wrong
idea of real security is another ("hey, son, you have a wart on that
finger, better amputate the arm").
