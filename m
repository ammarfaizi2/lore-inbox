The discussion actually started because Dave said he did not have much time 
these days to maintain the page and Thomas offered to help.

For the time being, continuing to maintain Dave's page may be the best 
solution, I don't know.  People should tell Thomas what they think would 
be the best use of his time *now* to help the community.

Personally, I think there is a huge value in setting up a bug database, but
only after the feature freeze.  This way, all the developers can go to one 
place with all the problems listed and focus on fixing bugs for a while.
Once the 2.6 release appears, the bug database can be discontinued if 
there is no longer much interest.
As Rik pointed out, the key thing here is _maintained_ and the only time 
where we can be certain a bug database is going to be well maintained is 
between feature freeze and release, because that's when everyone will be 
working on fixing as many bugs as possible to make a rock solid release.

Cheers,

-- Guillaume
