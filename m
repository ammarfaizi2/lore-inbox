Actually, we were talking in private e-mail, so if we were discussing
the FAQ, you would've continued this there, but since you've decided to
bring this discussion out here, I'll continue it here for now..

I have unlimitted bandwidth, as do many others.  IF they don't they
shouldn't subscribe to this list, they should subscribe to the newsgroup
and pick-and-choose by sbject/thread.

I'm perfectly willing to see how much I'm wrong.  No one has yet shown
me that I'm wrong, though.  I'd be perfectly willing to see it if it
were shown.

I have a head start on you then, I started around age 8.  TI-99/4A & the
BASIC programming language back then (I even had a voice box for the
computer so I was writing programs that could talk which I thought was
the coolest thing.)  Moved on to the Commodore 64, 128, then moved into
the PC world kind of late, in 1990 I bought an XT 10MHz machine that
happenned to work with the commodore 128 monitor, and since then have
incrementally upgrade part by part to my current machine (haven't
upgraded in three years).

If I'm questioning people on this list, what makes you think I wasn't
smart enough to question them then??  Think about that one for a second?

Serverwise or backofficewise, penguins have their place.  On the
desktop, penguins have to learn to adapt to a different climate.  That's
off topic for the kernel list though.

Then don't read it, skip over to the next message and move on with
life.  As someone else put it, life is too short.

Few would be doing it if there weren't SOME benefit for themselves. 
That benefit _may_ be a better system for themselves.. Some may be the
intellectual satisfaction of a job well done.. Some may work for
companies like red hat or suse.. Some may work for companies that want
to replace old UNIX systems with cheaper PC hardware that does the same
thing...  Everyone has a motivating factor.

The answer to this is that I'm not in any way shape or form employed by
any company what so ever at present.  I'm considering part time work,
but will not say more about that because the last time I mentioned
something about an employer on a list where people thought I was a troll
(alt.support.depression.manic around 2000 when I was unmedicated) they
were sending faxes and calling the office where I worked at with
complaints.  I'd rather not forewarn any employer that I'm a little
off-center, though I guess it wouldn't hurt my chances of eventually
getting on social security disability which would cover my bills.
