Hi,

I have tried quite a lot of things but I'm really stuck now, so I come 
to ask some help here.

I have a laptop with a PCMCIA wireless card. With the 2.6.9 I had no 
problem to use it:

Module                  Size  Used by
orinoco_cs              9000  1
orinoco                41324  1 orinoco_cs
hermes                  8896  2 orinoco_cs,orinoco

But I can't find any way to activate it in the 2.6.10.

I noticed that quite a lot of things have changed around the PCMCIA, so 
I tried to build a configuration that was working but I didn't succeed.

I attach my .config for the 2.6.9 (which is working) and the last 
.config for the 2.6.10 that I came with (activating the option for the 
old Cardbus code doesn't work at all).

Thansk in advance.

Regards
