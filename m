I'm quite certain I've hit this twice today. Can't be 100% sure but the
bottom of the traces looked just like this and RIP was at
log_do_checkpoint(). Once sporadically and another time trying to hit
it. The workload both times was having two separate kernel trees, both
were 2.6.12-rc2-mm something and then in both of the trees I did ketchup
2.6.12-rc3-mm3 in both trees more or less at the same time.

So then I ran two concurrent while loops ketchuping trees. Something
like:
#!/bin/sh

while true
do
        ~/bin/ketchup 2.6.11-rc3-mm2
        ~/bin/ketchup 2.6-mm
        ~/bin/ketchup 2.6.11
        ~/bin/ketchup 2.6.11-rc1
done


It took less than an hour to purposefully hit the bug with this here. No
guarantees it will happen consistently however...

This is a dual cpu x64 with preempt running 2.6.12-rc3. I'm
attaching .config if it is of interest to anyone.
