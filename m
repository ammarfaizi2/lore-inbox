  Well, no.
  
  First, multicast doesn't really work on loopback. I don't recall why...
  One symptom of this is that one can't use the multicast transport for
User-Mode-Linux when not "online" (i.e. on the train). 

  Second, testing it via ping to 224.0.0.1 isn't really the right test.
You have to join a multicast group, etc...

  So, I don't think that the test was done right.
