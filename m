i have created a project on source forge for the creation of a kernel 
module called kgrid. it moves the core grid computing functions from a 
user-space library into the kernel. this project will ultimately 
produce a module that allows a linux box to become a node on a grid 
without the need for user-space programs. in essence, it will grid-
enable the os.
