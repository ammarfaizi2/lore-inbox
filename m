/me bad, /me bad :-)

"Don't *make* me think" was the book and sure if you change _make_ with
_let_ then the whole meaning is changed a lot.
Here, I wanted to be let (i.e. allowed) to think by being given a piece of
the most relevant information (WTF is SPI?), as opposed to being made (i.e.
forced) to think by searching here and there to find out what is SPI. The
result - I didn't find out, so I wrote this mail. But I am a person that
usually manages to find everything, so this made me at least frustrated.
And of course, nobody really forced me to think, I was just curious. Now I
know SPI is not related to me, at least not now, but I have the concept of
SPI that might come helpful some day.

Completely agree! Although it goes a lot off-topic, let me just say that I
think everybody needs a license to work with a tool as powerful and
sophisticated as a Net connected PC! Yes, everyone should be obeyed to pass
the test and there should be minimal age as well, same as a driving license.
You might not kill people directly, but you may let your PC help steal
money, spread viruses and SPAM, hog resources and whatever.
So, I don't get it why most people are happy enough to muddle through the
other OS ('cause windoze is a swear word) without even thinking about that.

Hmm, I should actually put a page with these thoughts instead of explaining
them over and over... now that they are getting clearer.

Sorry for the bandwidth,
Kalin.
