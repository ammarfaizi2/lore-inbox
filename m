Quoting from
<http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=2hhl0l%2494r%40klaava.Helsinki.FI>:

"In short, the next version of linux (0.99.15) will be a "full-featured"
release, and only obvious bug-fixes to existing features will be applied
before calling it 1.0.  If this means that your favourite feature or
networking version won't make it, don't despair: there is life even
after beta (and it's probably not worth mailing me about it any more:
I've seen quite a few favourite features already ;-)."

Regards, Olaf.
