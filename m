Marcelo,

It cannot possibly break anything for somebody who does not
use it, and I am not aware of any unresolved problems in it,
i.e., I don't think it can harm its users either.

Yes and no. This driver has been announced here 3 times,
the latest announcement being this:
http://www.kerneltraffic.org/kernel-traffic/kt20040807_270.html#7

However, I did not announce the latest release here on the list,
and only emailed you personally last Sunday, because I felt that
there are not enough differences with the previous release. This
was a mistake and I'll make an announcement in a separate email.

I would appreciate a review of the driver very much.

Thanks again,
