Sorry about the misnumbering; there were about half a dozen other
pidhashing related things that didn't make the cut (omitted largely
due to theoretical issues or not having enough testing bandwidth for
tonight's run) along with a fair amount of other non-pidhash-related
fat included in the original numbering scheme before the patch series
got renumbered and refined down to bits relevant to single maintainers.
Some were also excluded due to mutual interference.
