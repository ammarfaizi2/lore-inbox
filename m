Personally, I did "B.Sc. Computer Studies", but I suspect the actual
course title is irrelevant, and it's the modules you do in the course
that matter. Here's what I would regard as important:

 1. A thorough knowledge of programming in C. Knowledge of C++
    will help.

 2. Experience of programming hardware will definitely help.

 3. The ability to think logically is a definite advantage, and
    tends to result in 90%+ of your programs working first time.

Additions, anybody?

Best wishes from Riley.
