Llh is all good and nice, cause it works (most of the times anyway), but with 
every new release the possibility of desync from kernel increases - downfalls 
of maintaining it as a separate package. Could anybody point me to some 
conclusions about how the thing should be done The Right Way (preferably with 
some input from high profile kernel hackers, so I can have some assurance 
that once something gets done it will get merged)?
