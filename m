Out of interest, how would that solve anything? So I use an ISP instead.
Then I have to download all my mail to home to read it. Talk about a
total waste of time.

It's hard enough tracking my mail as it is, let alone having to have another
account just to handle a certain mailing list.

I disagree, and while I may be in the minority on this list, I am certainly
not in the minority across the board, given that virtually every mailing list
I am subscribed to DOES prepend a tag to the subject line.

This I can buy. But it is, IMHO, the only valid argument against doing so.

Of course. Wouldn't want to interrupt our regular traffic for too long :)
