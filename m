>From reading the article, the author showed that he understood the open 
source world fairly well (better than my grandmother), even taking a crack at 
Microsoft at one point:

"il servizio Hotmail di Microsoft, che gestisce la posta per oltre 12 milioni 
di utenti Internet, non "gira", come si dice nel gergo tecnico, su 
piattaforma Microsoft, ma su di un aggregato di pacchetti Open Source."

"Hotmail, from Microsoft, doesn't run on a Microsoft platform but rather a 
collection of Open Source packages."

He also discussed Perl, Python and other projects at length.  Basically, from 
his writing, I think that he was more missinformed that actually pushing real 
FUD.  I'll bet when he investigated the story, somebody close to him 
mentioned that Linus had the final say on what went into the kernel, and he 
probably saw a few e-mails on Google from people with rejected patches, and 
he assumed that there was something rotten going on.  And it probably doesn't 
help that we are always fighting amongst ourselves over architecture, 
implementation and the such.  An uneducated person reading over the archives 
would probably assume that Alan and Linus are ready to start hunting each 
other down, and the articles they write would probably reflect this.

Didn't Abraham Lincoln say that?  :)
