It simply says role (or ro^le). The Oxford guide to style and Fowlers
have no opinion. 

For co-op* words the style guides prefer the hyphen because it makes the
pronunciation clearer but doesn't strongly recommend. For cases where
there are clashing words (ie there is a co-foo, and cofoo is a different
word) it is required ot use the hypen.

Essentially: pick one and stick to it.
