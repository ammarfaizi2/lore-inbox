And yet I was able to call dell and just order an older card to go in my
Inspiron.  (A standard 802.11b card; orinoco on a pci->cardbus bridge.) 
The only regulatory info they mentioned was including a pack of the
certified-by stickers to replace the ones that were on the laptop from
the original card.

I'm dubious.  (And also consider that I can go buy a randomly-branded
antenna to plug into my orinoco pcmcia cards without having to get them
certified together..)
