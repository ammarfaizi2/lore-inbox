2.6.0-test2 works great for me, with the exception of the
mouse, which seems to have been hyper-accelerated by the kernel
upgrade. I've had to turn the mouse speed and acceleration to
the very lowest possible, and even then, it's pretty hard to
hit something the first time.

My config and dmesg are attached, I do have Anticipatory Scheduling
enabled, if that makes a difference.

System stats are:

Redhat 9
Pentium 3, 700MHZ
512 MB RAM
