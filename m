To make the process interesting long term, you need the periodic mass
extinction to open up ecologic windows for new development. Absent
that you would wind up stuck in some local optimum.

The current Linux environment is much like the accelerated change
observed in directed breeding... say with breeding dogs or horses...
with an "intelligence" pushing toward desired characteristics (instead
of blind nature) progress is very rapid.
