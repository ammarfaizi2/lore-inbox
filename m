And how many times have you actually stood in front of a Judge over IP 
and contract issues?
The language "GPLv2 or any later version" is what it is. You can change 
it moving forward, but
you cannot undo the past. You put this language in there and IT WAS WHAT 
YOU MEANT AT THE
TIME. Trying to alter that would most likely result in a finding you are 
acting in bad faith.

Anyway, I am not religious on it, v2 or v3 I don't care, but I like v3 
and I am moving my stuff to it. It's a
good idea.

Anyway, good luck figuring it out Linus. You should listen to Alan -- 
he's right and is trying to help you.
