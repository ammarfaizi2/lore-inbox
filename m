Until you learn to play nice with people and mesh within the
fabric of Linux development, I adamently do not classify you
as you appear to self-classify yourself.  You don't contribute,
you sit in your sandbox and then point fingers at the people who
do know how to work with other human beings and say "see how much
that stuff sucks?  well my stuff works, nyah!"

I fear you will hold a grudge about this forever.

If Linux itself is worse off and went backwards in time for a while, it
is because of your inability to work together with people.

I know it may be hard for you to accept this fact, but I can tell you
that continuing to point the fingers elsewhere is going to be a repeated
dead end.
