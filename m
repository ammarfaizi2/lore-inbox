Just curious, did anybody ever look in to this at all ? I keep
on downloading new kernels and trying 4GB of memory - still no
luck.

I did file a bug report but didn't get any notifications at all.
I don't subscribe to the linux-kernel list so not sure if anything
ever came up or not.

Is there a way to get this fixed ?

Thanks,
rudi
