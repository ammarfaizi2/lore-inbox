It might be nice to have a link to that patch from the "download" page.
I didn't see that patch the first time from
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/misc-patches/

because I assumed that the interesting patches were linked from the 
downloads page. Atleast a hint that there is a badblocks patch available
on the ftp site on the downloads page, so that the reader can go grab 
this patch. 

Hopefully this will extend my mileage until drive replacement :)
Though I think I'll back a few more things up before attempting 
a kernel compile.
