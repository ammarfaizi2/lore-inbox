What's up doc, nice to see you here !  :-D

Honestly, I don't know what to think right now, perhaps all that SCO's stuff 
was a mere smoke-bomb (you kown, that's M$ bombs what we seen back in the 
90's :-D  agaisnt IBM ?, remember OS/2 --> xxxNT ?)

A chimp's IQ level CIO of any company don't start to sue everyone in the 
planet if  he have a little of common sense about they possibilities to win 
(or else they must to be prepared for the linux's strike back :-} ), and for
this particular case they are, to say, very very wired (AFAIK they haven't 
provide a concise probe of that _stolen-critical-olimpicus-code_ that nobody 
else on this planet can write, except off course, SCO and their ilumminated 
community of gurues :-D  ).


cheers
