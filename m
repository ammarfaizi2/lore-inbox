    A couple of months ago someone on this list said that ATI no
longer provides information about their graphics cards, so when I say
'supported' I'm speaking of my particular model, that it's really
supported (is a quite old model). When I said 'all ATI cards' I was
talking about older models, because I forgot that ATI no longer
supports Linux.

    My mistake, sorry. BTW: what graphics cards manufacturer currently
supports Linux?. I need to buy a new graphic card for a friend (AGP)
and I don't know what one to buy :(((
