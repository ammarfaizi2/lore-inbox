Perhaps it would be illuminating to know that I was BSD hacker, 
and that I learned the value of this particular technique from
Sun's kernel group, who once upon a time were the best BSD group
on the planet.  It might also be illuminating to consider that 
this technique of getting people to listen is still in use at
Sun to this day.

Perhaps Sun's professionalism is not what you'd like to see here.
