 A behaviour that is not very different from gthe GMs, BMWs,
daimler-Chryslers, Toyota, "you name them" of this world.

 I never said I liked the attitude.

 Actually we have/had a similar situation here in Germany. We are  used
to having "licensed dealerships" which are only allowed to sell one car
