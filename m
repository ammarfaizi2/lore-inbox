I  wish to hell it was FUD. I have watched all the Sun Workstations
at work be replaced with Windows/2000/Professional PCs. I have watched
all the 'nix programmers leave, replaced by Internet junkies who
don't (can't) write any code. In spite of the fact that don't actually
use their machines for any work, about 10 percent out of 600++ are
down at any one moment, most always to "reload Windows".

Just to get this Windows machine up at home, tonight, I had to reconfigure
the network because it "forgot" everything it knew  last night
about the LAN. I use Windows at home only because I compose music
using Cake-walk and it hasn't been ported to Linux. It is a corrupt,
defective, dastardly, incredibly obnoxious operating system that
has no redeeming qualities at all. Virtually every Windows program
has horrible bugs that make it barely usable. Even Microsoft Visual
C/C++ will take down the whole machine when it encounters source files
that don't have a CR/LF sequence as an end-of-line (accidental Unix LF
files). It is the worse programming environment, ever, and I have even
used a MDS-200 "Green Monster" during my 35 years as an Engineer. 

This machine used to have two CPUs. I had to take one out when I
changed it from a Linux machine to a Windows machine. Two CPUs under
Windows will trash the file-system so it won't boot if it's been
up for over an hour. I have reloaded Windows on my two Windows machines
at least once per week, usually more often than that. My Linux machines
run until I break them by installing a buggy driver. Even then, I
can reboot and nothing bad happens to the file-systems.

Once Windows fails to boot, you can reinstall from a CD/ROM, but
it won't boot after the reinstall! You need to make Windows "think"
that the boot disk is new by deleting all partitions before you
"reinstall" Windows or the new installation won't boot.

Microsoft has trained the "new breed" of Engineer that bugs are
normal and a natural consequence of using computers. This has
helped destroy software development as an Engineering endeavor and
substituted in its place, a developmental crap-game.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
