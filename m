Lots of people do; those who use bitkeeper, and even people (like me) who 
don't use it to manage source but still use the info at bkbits.net to 
track what patches got merged etc.

Ohh and by the way, Larry doesn't deserve comments like that. He's done a 
lot of hard work for everyone here (not to mention spent a lot of money) 
and he's provided an excellent tool. He deserves gratitude and respect, 
not childish BS like the above.
