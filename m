Alan, if you're reading this: I've sent a report containing the messages I
got and cc-d it to andre as you requested. I haven't heard anything since,
which suggests it didn't get through.

My apologies if you did get it but are to busy to confirm. I'm just trying
to make sure my report gets through.

To be certain I included the report again below the quote of my original
posting.

Regards,

Johan.

No problem.

Andre: This is about kernel 2.4.8 with RZ1000 support failing to find my
IDE drives, while 2.4.8 without RZ1000 succeeds (however without the fix
to the prefetch bug ofcourse). I posted something on the kernel list
yesterday. I did not test other 2.4.x kernels.

For completeness sake I think I should mention one peculiarity of my BIOS.
Some time ago I used to have two master IDE drives on seperate IDE
interfaces. The BIOS reported however that there was a C: and a D: drive,
which led linux 2.2.10 to think that there was a hda, hdb and hdc. 

Since this was annoying at bootup I make a hack in probe_cmos_for_drives()
in ide-probe.c to disable cmos probes, after which things were fine. I
have been using a master/slave setup for some time without problems (in
2.2.10) now, but perhaps you find this information relevant.

For (I hope) convenience I include my kernel config file. The only
difference in both configurations shoud be CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000 as that is
the only thing I changed with 'make menuconfig'. Messages of both working
and failing kernels are included.

Playing around with PCI probing method from 'any' to 'BIOS' did not help as
probably should be expected. The same applied to enabling DMA support.

If there is anything else you want to know, just tell me.

Regards,

Johan.
