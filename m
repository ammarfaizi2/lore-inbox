True, I take this on board, perhaps my devel team can look at an alternative
e.g. a couple of verifying modules.

I embrace it because like war in Iraq, its gonna happen anyway...
Without a alternative, the government will have to accept
monopoly.

Because they certainly "ain't no good at suing 'em".
Im not intending on using DRM to spread proprietary
works, im gonna use it to protect my confidential documents
and my GPL source. 

DRM is a good idea, used only by a bad idea of company.

Nuclear power is good but under bad hands...
