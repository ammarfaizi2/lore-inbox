I had promised Hazelton and some other folks to notify them wen I setup 
the archives.  Since I cannot post the code
at kernel.org ay longer, I had to setup an alternate server for NWFS 
updates and WMFS.  There's code there, go look again. 
I am posting a bunch of patches later this week (when I get over this 
flu I've had).  I won't be putting out any more GPL code due to the 
kernel.org
situation -- CDDL only.  I also won't be giving stuff away totally for 
free anymore either.  I am obligated to return GPL
changes in the kernel.  That's what folks are going to get, along with 
some technical dialouge from time to time.
