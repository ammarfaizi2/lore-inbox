err.. replying to right place this time o.0

I booted the machine 6 times or so and it died in the same
place each time. I also did make mrproper, and reconfigured.
(which is the kernel below).

The bk tree was current when i built it, and current as of
about an hour ago.

Stripping stuff out (sound, etc) didn't make any difference I
could tell, however booting maxcpus=0 , freezes after the
PCI: Probing PCI Hardware (bus 00) with no oops. The machine
just hangs. SysRQ keys do nadda =).

.config attached
