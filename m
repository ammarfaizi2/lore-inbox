I *KNOW* how to google...
I actually just needeed *DOCUMENTATION* I can't find anywhere, and the
author seems to ignore my mails (or it goes to spam trash, or whatever
happens, the thing is I don't get a reply)
I wonder how useful is a piece of code present in millions of boxes if
virtually NOBODY knows how to use it. and it annoys me a bit that many
requested features are out of the kernel, but a feature that is in the
main tree is virtually useless (if its really useful, where's the link
for the docs?)
</rant>
sorry, but I feel frustrated with that
