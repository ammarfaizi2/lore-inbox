Thanks for the information.

Gee, now I don't feel so bad about bringing down my firewall machine that
had been up 454.25 days before I brought it down to reconfigure it with
two NICs to support the new DSL connection. To think I was only 43 days
from a possible crash anyway takes some of the sting out of the event.
