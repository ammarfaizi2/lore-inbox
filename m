You seem to believe that you can get something for nothing.

Wrong.

You offer nothing to the open-source community, you get nothing back. That 
means very much that people don't support what you're doing, and you 
should realize that as far as the rest of the kernel is concerned, you 
ARE tainting it. 

The GPL is about a symbiotic relationship, where people help each other. 
In contrast, a binary module is a parasite - giving nothing back to the 
community. 

So live with that fact. Don't try to make it look like anything else.
