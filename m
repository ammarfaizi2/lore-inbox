No problems under XP so far...what kind of blocks would that be? Only had
time-outs on one of the disks when it was only slave (no master present
forgot to attach it :/) but since the master is attached that's gone.... all
my old data plays fine, mainly mp3's, games and movies.

I'll supply all of the info later, low on time now and it's late. Want the
kernel config and such as well? BIOS setup?

TIA and regards
