	I'm pretty satisfied with the spam filtering, though i have
	a *specific* observation about some fellows who claim to be 
	related to related to big people (or former big people) in 
	Africa and want us to transfer some money for them. 

	Now , these mails keep making rounds on this list, though
	they've improved my knowlege of African power politics 
	somewhat, and improved my who's who in Africa, i would 
	really like it if we could shut the spammer up.
