But part of this problem is that users get too much information that they 
don't understand, so they are getting used to ignore it. What you have to do 
to make the system easier to use is reduce the amount of information and make 
it easier to understand. The boot messages of the kernel are certainly much 
more than a regular user needs (and I am speaking those people who are 
currently using Windows or Macs, not Linux) and not very helpful for them.
