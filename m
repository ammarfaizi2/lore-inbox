I wish to know are we have backup plan any backup plan. Most of Linux users 
are gonna worry. 

Today I get a e mail from our local mailing lists. Says SCO sued Red Hat for 
this. another one asks Can M$ send BSA to check their systems and request 
licence money (because of buying SCO Unixware Licences). 

Rumors everywhere, people can't track of all sources about SCO vs IBM(Linux) 
case and each Rumor hurt us too badly. Every news people are gonna make worst 
case scenario and this is preventing people to buy expensive linux server 
systems (like rhas etc).

Of course Linux will live. I haven't got any question about it. But I fear 
this case between SCO and IBM may hit Red Hat, Suse and others. I believe non 
of these distros are disposable (uh oh expect Caldera/SCO).

Is there any way for backup plan?

I believe the backup plan will shut up SCO and burn those plans forever. 

Waiting for IBM is not good idea. 

Ps: I home my enlish enough to tell what I mean.. :)
