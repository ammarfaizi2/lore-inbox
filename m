Hi. Go do your homework. Check the URLs I gave you. The list of 
GPL-compatible licenses include licenses with the exact same 
"restrictions", namely the Modified BSD license. The URL is from GNU 
official page, so it is official that such licenses are accepted.

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html

I quote the text from there. It is a close match to the license in 
question, and has the same "restrictions" you are disputing.


Text from www.gnu.org:
=====
The modified BSD license. http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5
(Note: on the preceding link, the modified BSD license is listed in the 
"General" section.)

This is the original BSD license, modified by removal of the advertising 
clause. It is a simple,
permissive non-copyleft free software license, compatible with the GNU GPL.

If you want a simple, permissive non-copyleft free software license, the 
modified BSD license is a
reasonable choice. However, it is risky to recommend use of ``the BSD 
license'', because confusion
could easily occur and lead to use of the flawed original BSD license. To 
avoid this risk, you can
suggest the X11 license instead. The X11 license and the revised BSD 
license are more or less
equivalent.

There. Now stop arguing.
