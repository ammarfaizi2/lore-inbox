Half accurate

Over time we are gradually shifting more and more to metric units. Its slow
because the only fair way to let elderly people who don't know metric handle
things has been to wait until they pass on. 

Weights and measures have gone from imperial, through imperial and metric
now to metric values. We still have people selling 454g bags in part
because of the time it takes them to change sizes.

Other areas - alcoholic drink sizes, road distances and road speeds have yet
to be changed, but eventually will be.
