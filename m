Subject: Old Ne2000 Card with Starlan Port (I think)

I am trying to use linux to talk to a cabletron managed switch.

I have an old NE2000 card made by national semiconductor, which has what I
beleive to be called a starlan port (15 pin female connector) as well as
the standard twisted pair connector.  What do I need to tell linux to make
it talk through that Starfire(?) port?

Once I get it done what program would I need to talk through it? Minicom?
or something else?

Sorry if this is off-topic, but I thought I might need to pass the kernel
a parameter to get it to work.
