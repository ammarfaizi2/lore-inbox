Snicker, Snicker, Snicker ..... In all the time I've run Linux servers
for my business (about 4 years) I have never once installed a 
"Linux anti-virus" update.  No, I have not installed any W2K virus
software.  

I do, however, use a very powerful piece of Microsoft anti-virus 
software on my production servers -- it's called "the Linux 
Operating System."
