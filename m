So what?  Do you mean that we should all stop writing open source and go
home and grow cucumbers instead?  No amount of corporations get all paranoia
will stop Open Source and it might even stimulate it instead.  If
corporations get too annoying then there'll always be a bunch of people
motivated enough to say "up yours, we will manage to live without you
somehow".  If corporations, especially big old businesses, aren't able to
adapt to the new twist because of their inertia, then of course they'll try
to use their weight to stop those who don't play by their rules because
that's less effort than adapting to the new emerging conditions.  But what's
new there?  It's been like that since the emergence of human kind on Earth.

On the other hand it didn't work for Microsoft -- they've rather been more
successful at cloning/copying what others did before them.

While M$ Word is a de facto standard today, like WordPerfect used to be 15 
years ago, it doesn't mean that an Open Source solution won't have its turn 
in 5 or 10 years from now.  Of course that won't happen right away, and 
it'll take time and development efforts.  That why people are working on 
Word alternatives _now_.

Of course M$ does not like that.  Is this a reason to stop trying to push
them aside?  Absolutely not.  If they lose their market that'll be because
the alternative (be Open Source or not) is simply better for the user.  
They might try encrypting the data or whatever, but then they'll just create
an incompatibility with their own standard and people won't upgrade to the
new version, or if they force people into upgrading that'll create just more
incentive toward the Open Source solution among the users.

You feel just like Microsoft now, aren't you?

A BK clone just has to be better and BK becomes irrelevant.  Face it, that's
like that even among corporations with proprietary products.  When your only
reaction left is to encrypt the data to preserve an edge over the
competition rather than improving your own product for increased user value
then it means that you've reached the best you can achieve in your closed
environment and Open Source will surpass you just because of the larger mind
share.  If in that context an Open Source clone becomes better for the user
then no amount of corporate whining will change that fact.  The only thing
corporations do better is to organize focused development and to come with
mature products faster.  They therefore saturate faster in terms of
innovations with regards to a given products.

One day, there'll be a M$ Word alternative or clone that works just as fine
as Word itself, especially since Word can't bring a revolution in the word
processing field anymore.  And from that day that alternative will just get
better.  But before it happens, M$ will certainly try hard to twist the
rules which will give nothing to users but slow down competition.  That'll
only buy them some time nothing more.

Then... if you're so confident about you remaining the leader in the SCM 
world, why are you afraid of possible BK clone attempts?  The leader will 
_always_ be chased regardless.  That's part of being a leader.
