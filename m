n> What is the status of autofs4?  There is no mention in
n> 2.4.0/Doc/Changes.  There doesn't seem to be any activity in the
n> ftp.kernel.org/.../autofs area.  Is autofs4 alive?

Yes, it is.  Jeremy has been responding to bug reports and issuing new
userspace prereleases every so often.  As far as I know, autofs4 has
been in fairly wide use for a while, and could reasonably be
considered stable (I've been using it since he started working on it,
with few problems).
