I guess I need to break it down to simple terms, and hoped that your
broadcast in expertise could cover your mouth.  This makes it harder for
me because I do not communicate well over email.

Firewire 1394, USB, Parallel Port, PCMCIA/CardBus are all effective
tailgates via an alternate physical transport layer and protocol.
Therefore it should be obvious many different versions of the hardware get
it wrong.  Now in other operating system which are commerial based, there
are device specific drivers to perform soft-protocol corrections to
generate the appearance of a perfect product.  Much as in optics, here is
another case where two wrongs make a right.  COSTAR for Hubble Space
Telescope is real world example.

This to counter your grand statement of there are no problems with any
ATAPI devices after 1993.  Yet anyone who know about the physical bus
layer to support the ATAPI protocol, would realize problems generated by
that document.  Now moving forward in time, there is a conflict in
operations between SFF-8020 rev 2.6 and Mt. Fuji and MMC and lastly Mt.
Rainer.

If you knew anything about the production industry, and maybe you do, it
would be obvious that most of the Far East and Pacific Ring hardware
people are still creating product based on SFF-8020 a retired document.

Yet you stand here and glorify straight SCSI as the transport with a
wrapper assuming that Mt. Fuji and MMC 1/2/3 out of T10 and STA will solve
all the problems of the world.

Your world thinks all hardware regardless is perfect, and that is nice.
My world knows different and attempts to let you continue to enjoy the
fantasy.

I just asked you for a formal preferred model coresponding to READ/WRITE
10/16 fixed to the OS standard CDB as the base of a Packet Interface, yet
you counter with a redirect. :-/

Put up or shut up.

Insert "Joerg Schilling" Perfect Packet Interface for review.

Thank you for the chortle,
