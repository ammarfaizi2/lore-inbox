AFAICS (ATM), you have exactly three possibilities:
- Start and maintain this "community based longer lived stable tree".
- Pay someone to do it.
  If you can be more precise, what you really want I can write you an

- Stop whining that others are not doing the workfor you (i.e. *your
  work*) for free.
