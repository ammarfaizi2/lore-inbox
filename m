The GPL could be enforced under UCITA.  Whether someone would succeed 
or not is another matter, but a claim could be brought.  The GPL is 
a "contract" and it's not "fundamentally different" in any significant
way from any other software license.  It defines how someone may use 
software and what obligations they have.  In fact, it's exactly the 
type of contract UCITA addresses.  disagree.
