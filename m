Thanks for the tip! I'm not familiar with BK at all, so I'll have to try 
it. So far, I've been collecting all the diffs to the CREDITS file back 
to version 1.0. Of course, I've some time on my hands, and I enjoy every 
  minute of insanity ;)

The fun part will come when it is time to cross-reference and index it 
all. I'm not sure I'm up to that yet, but we'll see what happens. Thanks 
again!

Peter
