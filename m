Unsupported by whom?  Matrox?  That would assume they support it under
Windows (they barely do -- or used to.)  However, you are correct in that
Matrox has no intentions of creating Linux drivers for the video capture
capabilities of the card.  And they are not extremely forthcoming with
information -- it would appear both MacroVision and DVDCCA have nukes
wired into their offices :-)
