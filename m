No.  Since you are up to date with the latest in everything, I cannot
see why you would be concerned about a few megabytes in your gigabyte
drives.

No.  Both of my cheap on-site systems for occasional access are 486s.
Why would I spend money for a system that is hardly ever used?

No.  There are still plenty of unique ISA cards around.

OK, I haven't seen one of these for nearly 10 years.

Send me the funds to replace my laser printers please.

OK, everything that I had in a.out was converted within a year of
ELF's introduction.

You left out all the old non-IDE CDROM drives.
