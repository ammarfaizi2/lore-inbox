Hello,

URGENT NEED.


Warm greetings to you and your family.
I am Simon Oliver, an Aide of Ex President 
Charles Taylor. 

As you may know he has recently stepped 
down from power and is presently in asylum in
Calabar.

The purpose of my letter is to ask if you can 
render the assistance requested and to bring 
to bear my present position and the very need
for true and solicited help with respect to 
Ex President Taylor. 

Your assistance is needed in the sense that
some funds derived from Diamond sales during his 
tenure needs to be transferred/moved from its 
present location to a place or an account that 
you may hopefully provide or arrange.

The reason for this is that plans are underway 
to confiscate not only his known fixed assets 
but also liquid assets.

I have been mandated to seek and find a relaible 
person, based overseas, that is disposed in 
helping to secure some or all of the funds in 
question.

If you are that person, do respond to this letter. 
Otherwise no offence meant. 

Sincerely yours,

Simon Oliver.
