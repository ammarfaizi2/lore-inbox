Okay, so being unfamiliar with strace, I should be able to invoke something
like "strace -o log realplay some-realaudio-url"? And this should mean
something to me?

Thanks for reasuring me there's something broken in the module. Xavier, do
you happen to know what transport mode your realplay is using then? That
would show under View | Preferences | Transport. And if you hit the
Autoconfigure button therer, does it succeed? It doesn't for me either with
or without the module loaded, and it used to with a 2.2.17 kernel plus
realplay 7 rather than 8.

Of course, the masq module is only to handle udp - if real goes to tcp it
doesn't need it, so I suspect what Xavier's seeing is it working via tcp -
but perhaps some servers today refuse to do anything but udp connections?
