I would hope IBM have more intelligence than to attempt to destroy the
product by trying to force all sorts of junk into it. The Linux world
has a process for filterng crap, it isnt IBM applying force. That path
leads to Star Office 5.2, Netscape 4 and other similar scales of horror
code that become unmaintainably bad.

You think things like EVMS are a product marketing decision. I'm very
glad you don't run a Linux distro. It would turn into something like the
old 3com rapops rather rapidly by your models (3com rapops btw ceased to
exist and for good reasons)
