Somebody is sending out trojan mail with forged headers claiming to be
from members of the Linux community.  Some mails have gone out under my
address.  I just one from singnet.com.sg claiming to be from Rusty
Russell, it contained a Windows trojan.

Unfortunately some people on Linus lists use Windows and might be taken
in by the forged headers on these trojans.  Be careful, even if you
think that you recognise the sender.
