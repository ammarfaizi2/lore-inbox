The most common reason is that someone else, like employer or university,
specifies or even provides the hardware. After that comes system price, a
system with a less-than-perfect device may be much cheaper than the
perfect solution.  Many people have a low money to time ratio, and when
affordable hardware becomes available it's only possible to use it. And in
some cases the offending hardware may be unremovable, as in soldered on.
Think laptop.
