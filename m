Alright, in 2.4.3, the AMD-756 [Viper] USB device is 'blacklisted'
because of a 'serious erratum.'  This chipset has worked perfectly for
me in 2.4.2 with a USB mouse, and I'm wondering how I might go about
re-enabling the usb-ohci module to accept this chipset.  I'm not at all
squeemish about a little coding, if necessary - I just don't know what I
need to do for this stuff.  I'd kinda like to upgrade to 2.4.3 because
of some bugs in the ide-scsi CD emulation stuff that I think is fixed in
2.4.3, but I can't really do so without my mouse working.  ~,^

Thanks everyone!
