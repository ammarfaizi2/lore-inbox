At the potential cost of getting flamed, I think it is worth pointing 
out that the FSF's copyright assignment policy on several of their 
projects is _very_ anti-freedom.  You are required to relinquish all 
your rights to your contributions, in exchange for the hope that the FSF 
will protect them.

So, like the GPL, you are really _giving up_ rights and freedoms for the 
overall cause of software freedom.
