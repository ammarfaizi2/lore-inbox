Sam, this version includes the CVS portion.

Automatically append a semi-random version if the tree we're building
isn't tagged in BitKeeper or CVS  and CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO is set.
 
This fixes the case when Linus (or someone else) does a release and tags
it, someone else does a build of that release tree (i.e, 2.6.11), and
installs it.  Later, before another release occurs (i.e, -rc1), another
build happens, and the actual, released 2.6.11 is overwritten with the
-current tree.
 
This currently supports BitKeeper and CVS (assuming the format is the
same as the BK->CVS tree)
