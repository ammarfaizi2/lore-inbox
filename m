Jim,

I wonder if it is a basic question about "how to" configure a kernel or
simply a question about comparion of "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig" or
etc.

If it is the first case, I urge you to read the README file first.
In the later case, it depends if you want to run it in X window or not. To
me, I have used both and found no difference.


Anthony
