Not for PCI.  alsaconf checks the return status of modprobe for ISA
non-PnP devices, though, so we would fix it once if the probe model
were changed.

Exactly, that's the reason I suggested.  To keep the behavior of
driver consistent.

OTOH, I'm not 100% for that change, because I know that it will break
the old behavior as mentioned in the above.  Such a breakage isn't
always a good buy against just-for-cleanness or consistency...

Well, you can remove the whole

	if (!cards)
		... unregister...

in the probe callback if we follow the pci driver model, i.e. modprobe
doesn't return an error if no device is found at the moment.

Hm, surely it's not so intuitive in the case of ISA devices.  Maybe
it'd be better to keep the current behavior:  probe() returns an error
if no device is found at loading...
