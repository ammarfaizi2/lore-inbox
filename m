Dear me, bitkeeper isnt causing problems except on the odd occasion someone
sends a file bk only, and Larry has a sane answer brewing even for that. 
You can grab 2 hourly snapshot diffs of linus bk head v 2.5.latest from
ftp.nl.linux.org, and specific patches he submitted.

As to the diary. I put it on the net because it seemed a sane place for it,
however asking me to change it for the benefit of passers by is rather like
complaing to a neighbour that you don't like the colour of their wallpaper
when you peer into through their windows
