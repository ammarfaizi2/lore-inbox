I would disagree.

What you talk about is "idealism". You can be idealistic about anything. I 
agree that rms is also idealistic, but that's not what makes him 
extremist. There are a lot of idealistic people who aren't extreme.

Extremism has nothing to do with _what_ the ideal is, but with how you 
state them. That's not just my interpretation, I can back it up with 
actual meaning of the word. 

	S: (n) extremism (any political theory favoring immoderate 
		uncompromising policies)

That's from wordnet.princeton.edu.

Note the "ANY" in "any political theory".

And that "immoderate" and "uncompromizing" is rms to a T.

So please, if you want to argue semantics, at least look up the word 
first. When I said extremist, I didn't use that word in the wrong way.

For example, the difference between a "deeply religious person" and an 
"extremist religious person" is not in their depth or trueness of their 
beliefs. It's in whether they want to allow other people to believe 
otherwise and can compromize when dealing with those other people.
