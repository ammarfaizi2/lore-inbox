The AS kernel sources are up on http://www.kernelnewbies.org/kernels/ if 
anyone needs them. I think all the relevant stuff is in base kernels
nowdays. They collect kernel source sets so if anyone wants to send them
the ones they don't have - be it montavista, unitedlinux or whatever
they'll be glad to add them to the browsable set.
