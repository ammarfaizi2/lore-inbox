thanks, yes, I knew about that, but the thing is, I would
like to use this as automated test (well first step of
an automated test) for linux-vserver[1] development, and 
for that purpose i386/ia64 and ppc/ppc64 is a good start 
but not nearly sufficient, we currently 'support' (or at
least try to ;) the following archs:

  alpha, i386, ia64, mips/64, hppa/64, ppc/64
  sparc/64, s390/x, x86_64, uml

and got an officially assigned syscall number for 

  i386, s390, sparc/64, sh3/4, x86_64

but if you are interested in extending this and making
it available for linux-vserver kernel compile tests
too, I'm willing to help if I can ...

TIA,
Herbert
