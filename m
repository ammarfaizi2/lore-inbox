Heil Gurus,
don't know where to seek for help, I digged the web and IBM's support site
up'n down with not much luck.
I need to install RedHat 7.0 on a IBM NetFinity 5100 with a ServeRAID 4L
controller (firmware 4.40.03).
The plain RedHat 7.0 install CD-Rom doesn't detect the controller
therefore I cannot install linux because it can't detect the RAID
controller and therefore the disk array is not available.
Unfortunately on IBM support site there is not clear documentation/howto
for installing Linux RedHat 7.0 on this type of machine.
I am thinking to make some custom setup diskette in which I would compile
the available ServeRAID drivers from the IBM support site... but the
problem is that I don't know how to make this custom RedHat 7.0 install
diskette.
Please CC me because I am not subscribed to the LKML.

Thank You & Best Wishes for the New Year!
