I have been trying to compile 2.4.19-pre 9 on my RH7.3 system

Eveything seems to compile and install howver when I try to boot with
the new kernel every modules comes up with an undefined sybol error
and fails to load

System boots if I dont have a initrd - just no modules 

1. Has anyone else come across this
2. Anyone any idea what could be the problem

No need to cc, I will check the list
