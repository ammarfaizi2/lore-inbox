www.osdlab.org is the closest you will get right now.

Since we have only recently opened we have been working to get the machines 
configured and ready for beating.  We have only recently started opening up the 
larger servers to developers and testers.

Any regression/scalability development and testing people want to do should be
workable.  Anyone interested in coordinating development or testing at our lab
can contact me for info.
