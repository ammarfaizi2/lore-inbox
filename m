This depends on your definition of dealing with MSisms. If you mean having a
copy of an MS product physically present at a business location, that's
pretty much unavoidable.

If you mean working at a place where you yourself don't have to deal with it,
it all depends what line of work you're in. If you're some form of management
person, you might choose to work with Word because everyone else does, but
that goes back to it being your decision.

I can think of a lot of companies, such as WindRiver, QSSL, etc. where there
may be some level of involvement, but not everyone working in the company is
forced into things.

What a petty thing to hate a corporation over. If you're using a company's
product of your own free will, any issues that might arise out of using
the product is something you accepted when you purchased the product.

Not knowing ones options is also not the fault of MS. If you don't do your
research before getting into something, and you get screwed as a result, it's
your own fault for not looking into things before making a decision.

What does that have to do with anything? Someone makes some many, and they're
suddenly the cause of world hunger because they could donate all their money
but don't? This is also a moronic statement, as I seem to recall Gates
starting up a foundation for such things, and donating money to charity.

While I may not like alot of the things that MS does, or care for how Gates
does business, I'm still not going to try and blame the worlds problems on
him simply because he does some things I don't like.
