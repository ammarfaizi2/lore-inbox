I thought these were incredibly important, as it might have a
devastating effect on U.S. Linux developers if it ever passed. But
please don't add more comments on it to this list, instead point it out
to your local area Linux users. Here are some links on an effort to ban
all computer systems that don't pass a government security
certification:

I'm sorry if this isn't directly "development", but article will explain
that in the long run, developers would be devastated if the proposed
legal changes take place.
