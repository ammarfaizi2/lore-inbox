I believe Linux-ATM on sourceforge http://linux-atm.sourceforge.net/

I noticed you posted this same question there a month ago...

Developers of Linux-ATM on SourceForge

Werner Almesberger  almesber    almesber at users.sourceforge.net
Mitchell Blank Jr   mblank      mblank at users.sourceforge.net
Paul B. Schroeder   paulsch     paulsch at users.sourceforge.net

You could sign up as a developer to that project on
sourceforge and make CVS changes there.

Of course you could always send the patches to the lk list
and/or you could become the maintainer.

From: Chris Friesen [mailto:cfriesen@nortelnetworks.com]

I've got some feature enhancement patches for ATM and SONET drivers, as well
as
an API enhancement to support VBR traffic shaping.

Who is the appropriate person to send them to?  I don't see an entry in
MAINTAINERS for ATM/SONET.
