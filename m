What does everybody think of the idea of trying to write a RISC PROM-like
BIOS for the x86 architecture?

I've been tossing the idea around in my head for a while, and after I got
my first SGI I realized that something like this would be fairly useful.
Basically, I'm wondering if anybody is already doing something like this
(not linuxBIOS, though the code for that could be a useful base).  Thanks.
