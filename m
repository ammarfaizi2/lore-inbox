vger.kernel.org now has a mailing list for the discussion of linux on
the ia64/itanium/ipf platform.  See:

	http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html#linux-ia64

for details.

At the moment, the list is an alternative for
linux-ia64@linuxia64.org, which has been flaky as of late.  However,
it would be nice to convert to the vger list permanently.  One
showstopper right now is that there is no known archive for the list.
Would someone be willing to setup such an archive?

Thanks,

	--david
