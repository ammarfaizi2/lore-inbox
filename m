I've noticed in Kernel 2.4.10 that the emu10k1 driver produces cracks in
the sound output.

Is there a stable emu10k1?

The emu10k1 driver in all kernels < 2.4.7 is from 04-12-2000, which
produce excellent sound.

I've spoken with a few other guys on IRC, and they also have this
problem [of crackling, etc].

What would be the best course of action if one wants good sound in
kernels > 2.4.7?
