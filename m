Hi Alan,

I am now running 2.2.19-pre9 and it is working fine. Also, just in case, I
retyped this same message in pine in xterm and on the console. No
character loss whatsoever. Also, licq stopped losing characters as well.

I will continue using 2.2.19-pre9 until the evening and report anything
suspicious.

Regards,
Tigran
