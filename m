Basically, I use a hotmail and Outlook Express to help me SORT messages
on LKML.  It makes it MUCH easier for me to find the messages I want to
read vs the rest of the noise that I don't understand yet.

One thing is certain:  It is impossible to have a collection of geeks
this large, and not have some of them display the sort of egotistical
attitude that makes them go "Oh, he's using OE?  Well, I shall thumb my
nose in his general direction!  We should only allow
<Pine|Mutt|Emacs|Other> on this list.  Sniff.  Sniff.".

Just ignore it.  I do.  I learn more and more from this list everyday,
and if someone doesn't want to read what I have to say because of the
software I use to read the list, then I guess I'm not all that
interested in them reading it anyway.  :-)
