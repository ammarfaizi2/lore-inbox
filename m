   You are not native english speaker, I think.  (Not that I am either.)
It is about how to use pronouns "he" vs. "they".   An ISP is not a person,
thus more appropriate pronoun would be "it", but also "they" applies.

I prefer using "your ISP" when writing to people notifying them about
email system glitches for their address, and referring to that elusive
group of people making mistakes and screwing up that email reception.
