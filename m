So, GPL FAQ on FSF web-site <http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html>
is worth reading. It represents their thought.

* If a library is released under the GPL (not the LGPL), does that
  mean that any program which uses it has to be under the GPL?
  <http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#IfLibraryIsGPL>

* Why are some GNU libraries released under the ordinary GPL rather
  than the Lesser GPL?
  <http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#WhySomeGPLAndNotLGPL>

* I am writing free software that uses non-free libraries. What legal
  issues come up if I use the GPL?
  <http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#TOCWritingFSWithNFLibs>
