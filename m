My understanding was that Linus eventually decided upon something in the 
middle.  I understood that there still wouldn't be a 2.7.x branch 
(unless major changes occurred, which would severely risk breaking the 
stable tree).  However, it was also my understanding that Linus would 
return to the even/odd version system; but, would do so in the rev.  In 
other words, 2.6.even would be stable, while 2.6.odd would be 
development.  I did, however, become slightly confused when I connected 
to http://www.kernel.org and noticed that the latest stable kernel was 
2.6.11.11 because it's both odd and contains four version numbers rather 
than the  three, which we've usually seen.

Hope that clears up what my confusion is.

Thank you,
