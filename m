Subject: spelling of disc (disk) in /devfs

I accidentally built my 2.4.1 kernel with /devfs so had a interesting
few minutes looking round it to see what it was doing.

The thing that struck me most was the spelling of disc with a 'c'.  As
an Englishman this is the correct spelling for me most of the time,
but I have come to accept "as a technical term" disk (as in American)
is the right name for these devices.

I now find myself confused with the new approach.
