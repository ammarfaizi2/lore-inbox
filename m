Ideally, there should be no waiting around for replies.  The message is
sent, he starts whatever build/boot test cycle, checks for replies when
he's done and ready to release.  If nothing looks urgent enough to hold
it up, then he pushes the release.  I still don't see how this adds any
kind of terrible delay.
