Beat it, pop. You can't get that working with just the driver because it's 
an input interface. And just for a tip: if you are really interested in 
modifying the card, you should use different equipment:

 - soldering iron of the finest kind (you'll have to mess around on the PCB)
 - a multimeter to measure the output. This will preserve you some 
   speakers.

You'll possibly have to replace the chip, because the one that's on it 
might not agree with you seeing the line in as an output channel, or not 
handling the subchannels correctly.

What's this statement all about? I don't have a call with Micros~1, I'm 
Linux Kernel Hacker, and I've been kernel hacker since MULTICS.
