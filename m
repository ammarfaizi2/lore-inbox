Well, in Germany this would be illegal. The term is "sittenwidrig". 
You could even get sued if you _know_ about a crime being committed
and do not tell the police.

However, there is also "Verh‰ltnism‰ﬂigkeit" and I'd think that
breaking an NDA because "uh, they're ripping off some non profit
organization that gives out their sources for free and don't put their
modifications back in the open" don't exactly qualify as a
court-relevant fact.
