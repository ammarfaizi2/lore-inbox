IMHO the time of greybeards like Alan has passed.  It's
time for dynamic new leadership, unafraid to confront
conformancy!  That's why I nominate Rick Hohensee as
the new maintainer.  With cLIeNUX [1], he has demonstrated
that he can think outside of the box.

Vote Hohensee for Linux Kernel Leader!
