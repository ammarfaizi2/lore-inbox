Hi, 


 Prolong your ssex. You  have small peniis? Now you may increase it! Come on in: http://www.ollyert.com/gal/ms/ 


 Water that has been begged for does not quench the thirst A penny saved is a penny earned, and All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you An idle mind is.. the best way to relax. Every cross has its inscriptions But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
