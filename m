Hello Ion.

In the mean time, you can get my cleaned up version from
<http://www.badula.org/3c990/>. The 2.5 patch might not apply anymore
to the latest and greatest; let me know if that's indeed the case so
I can generate a new one.

It worked just fine with 2.5.59 and 2.4.21-pre4-ac1 kernels. Thank you very 
much. Although, I am looking forward to getting a driver that exploits all the 
features of this nic.

James
