Trust me, I don't intend to drag this any longer. I just want to make
sure this issue of "respect" is cleared up.

If there exists a cult where top contributors are to be venerated, then
I'm not part of it. If my calling individuals to account on their supposed
expertise on tracing, which they use as justification for continued
marginalization of such related projects, has generated so much backlash,
then it is for me but a sign of how entrenched arrogance can be in some
quarters.

Don't get wrong, I have immense respect for the collective talent of
kernel developers. But no matter how broad collective talent can be, it
cannot be omniscient.

Ditto.
