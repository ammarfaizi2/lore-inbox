Hi, 

recently I've seen a few problems with several laptops and if one are so 
unfortunate that one needs to reboot into Windows after a session in linux.
Normal restart of windows never have a problem on the same machines, but if 
you go from Linux to for instance Windows by shutdown -r or reboot it will 
freeze half way into the booting process. 

A power cycle will hower fix this. 

Anyone got an idea about where to start looking? 

Best regards
