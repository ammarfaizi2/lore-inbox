Richard, please grow up. 
This is not a forum for Red Hat customer support, and neither
is it one for puerile treats.

And yet you still refuse to offer any real reason for
your subversion of the license.  If the GPL causes you
so many problems, why stick with Linux ? I understand
Schillix is under a license that would probably be more
acceptable to you, and sounds like it has everything you need.

No-where in the previous mail did I make such a claim.
I stated that trying to educate you was as difficult and pointless
as trying educating pork.  I know metaphors are hard to get your
head around at first, but how old are you? 12 ?

Linux-kernel is not the place for this nonsense. Please take it elsewhere.
