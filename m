I'm a kernel newbie and just wanted to know what do most kernel hackers do
when working on the kernel say 2.5 when you make changes do u need to
recompile the kernel and reboot the machine to test your small modification
or do people use something like bochs. Also every time you makes changes in
the kernel it must be hell to recompile the whole thing do kernel hackers
just compile the specific file and link it into the kernel or something. Some
of these will be stupid questions to most of you but I am curious since I've
been working on the kernel lately and recompiling and rebooting is driving me
nuts
