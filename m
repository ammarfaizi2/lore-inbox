high!

is there any way to let the system execute something by pressing the ATX
power button (preferrable executing 'shutdown -h now', but would be nice
if it was configurable)

I looked into the (very large) list archive but didnt find any answer.
if it is a kind of FAQ or off topic, please point me to the place I could
find an answer.

PS.: Im not on the list, so please CC to my address if possible.
     (but its not vital as I also could look into the archive)

Thanks in advance

        Sergei
