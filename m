This is still broken. I've tried wading through the relevant fs/* bits but am 
apparently not yet smart enough to figure out what to change. Basically, it 
appears some quota bits are being compiled into the kernel with CONFIG_QUOTA 
unset, resulting in the following error at final link:

This does build okay with .21-rc1 or with .21-rc1-ac1 and CONFIG_QUOTA = y

thx,
