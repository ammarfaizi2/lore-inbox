Hello kernel dev

Are there any USB audio device manufactures who are releasing
datasheets and programming specs?

I am looking for example code for controlling USB devices in kernel-space. 
More specifically I would like to playback sound on a USB
device using the RTlinux variety of Linux. All initialization of
the device can be done in user-space using whatever API may be
available for such a device (hopefully a professional quality
device like the Roland SC-8850 or UA-100). I just need code to
start the actual playback in kernel-space. I have been writing
RT code for a while so I do not need help with the RT OS. I need
help with programming the device.

Any help would be appreciated,
Daniel
