I have't followed this much, but there are some lessons from the comments
on this (and previous patches):

- "isn't" (and such) get better changed to "is not", as 's give grief (at
  least in .S files)
- I wouldn't bother too much on broken editors that don't understand 's in
  comments or strings
- It would be better for you to tackle _all_ typoes in one area, get them
  fixed by the maintainer, then move on. Patches that change lines under
  the maintainers/other patches aren't wellcome, as they break the patches
  (and if they don't fix the code, people _will_ bitch at whoever
  integrates them)

Yes, I know this is a lot of work. But as it stands, it is a lot of
_wasted_ work if the patches aren't being integrated.

Thanks!
