before you go to far in condemming companies, note that even transmeta is
in this situation with their docs. when Linus was asked about
documentation for the longrun config stuff he stated that whil trasmeta
was planning to release both docs and source, they were not willing to
release them in the state that they are in currently.

and to be perfectly honest, they do have a point, if the internal
documentation is so poor, releaseing it will cause a flood of calls for
clarification of the docs. it's better to spend the time before release to
fix it then to spend the time (a much larger chunk of time) after the
release explaining it multiple times AND fixing the docs.

sometimes companies are not willing to spend that much time on what they
see as a minor market. that's just the fact of life.

the real fix isn't to yell at the companies, it's to show them that it is
a significant market and worth them spending their money there.
