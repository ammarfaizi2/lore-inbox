Streamload is one possibility.  There are others -- gmail and such. 
This is just what can be had *for*free*.

For that matter, the uploading process doesn't require a user to agree 
to those terms at all.  There's a module in CPAN that allows an upload, 
and never asks me to agree to any terms, nor does it ask me for an 
account password.

I don't have multiple accounts, I don't *use* the encryption to attempt 
to circumvent the download restrictions, especially considering that 
said download restrictions don't even come into play until I need a 
restore.  By the time I do need a restore, I'm willing to pay money, as 
100 megs a month is certainly not going to be enough.
