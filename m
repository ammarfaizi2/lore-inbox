'As a whole, the X.org community barely has enough resources to build a
single server. Splitting these resources over many paths only results in
piles of half finished projects. I know developers prefer working on
whatever interests them, but given the resources available to X.org,
this approach will not yield a new server or even a fully-competitive
desktop based on the old server in the near term. Maybe it is time for
X.org to work out a roadmap for all to follow.'

You lose.
