I think it would be a great a idea to put a link to the faq and
component page on the front page.  I'll see if I can find a spot to link
to the main page on the query page too.

Normally what I do is package up changes to the kernel bugzilla into an
rpm and then hand that to OSDL to install.  I currently have a few other
changes pending too so I will include the above updates as well.  I was
thinking of building a new rpm sometime in the first week or two of
January - after the holidays when I would be around more- if that is not
too late.

Jon
