Hi Marcelo,

you will find the kernel config file for our intel machines attached 
to this Email. I was not able to get a serial console today but i 
copied the relevant messages shown while booting up:

[...]
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
[...]
NET4: Unix domain sockets 1.0/SMP for Linux NET4.0.
VFS: Cannot open root device "803" or 08:03
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:03

Nothing more, nothing less. We discovered that the problem only occurs 
when booting on a "Tyan S2707" Mainboard. No problem with other 
mainboards. We disabled "ACPI Support" in BIOS setup for testing 
purposes and then 2.4.26 is booting even on this machine. But its very 
strange that it worked with 2.4.25 and not with 2.4.26 with the same 
config. Also the connection between ACPI and a RAID Controller is not 
clear for me.

Thanks for your time.

Jason Brian
