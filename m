I want to thank everyone on LKML for being patient with all the list 
traffic generated in regard to the open-source-friendly graphics product 
idea.  But now it's time for the discussions to break off onto their own 
list so that the rest of you can be spammed just a little less.  :)

Russel Miller of Duskglow Consulting (www.duskglow.com) was gratious 
enough to create a mailing list for me, and I would like to invite 
everyone who wishes to continue our discussion to please join me on the 
new mailing list.  Please visit the main list page at:
