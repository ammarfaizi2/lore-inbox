As one of the copyright holders I make no such exception. Its either a
derived work in law or its not. In the former case obey the license or
remove every line of code derived from anything I wrote.

If it's not a derived work then fine. If you aren't sure ask your
lawyer.

[Sorry I'm sort of obliged to reply to this comment to prove I'm
defending my
 copyrights and not accepting various positions Linus and others may
claim
 exist. I believe others like the FSF whose code is used in the kernel
have 
 similar views]
