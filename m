Subject: White Paper on the Linux kernel VM?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I am interested in reviewing the technical specifications on the Linux kernel VM.
As there has been much controversy of late on this subject, it would be relevant to compare the concepts behind both the former VM and the new VM in order to obtain a better understanding of the issues. 
Is there a “white paper” available on both the old and the new VM’s? 
Understandably, the VM is a work in progress; however, there should be a basic set of design goals and concepts from which future development will proceed.  It would definitely be helpful to present them both as an aid to further analysis.

Sincerely,
D. L. Beaman
