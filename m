I think you're being unreasonable telling me that I'm being unreasonable.

No.  It's quite simple.

I've worked on trying to replicate the problem today.  Tomorrow I'm
out at a meeting and since I'm no longer working on the problematical
hardware, it is being returned.

That means there's about 15 minutes left before I go to sleep before
having to be up early tomorrow to go on a 2 hour journey to attend a
meeting.  What do you want me to do with those 15 minutes?  Perform a
miracle maybe?

David, I ask you to retract your unreasonable mail.  I'm being quite
calm here.  I'm just pointing out the facts that as of *now* I'm no
longer in a position to test.

I was rather hoping that being crystal clear about the reasons about
_why_ I'm no longer able to continue participating in his problem
that I would be seen not to be unreasonable.

I guess I'm just cursed.

Sorry.
