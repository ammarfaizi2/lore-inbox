For the 52 and a half time, Im not trying to nock Linus. I think hes possibly the best coder we have. (if not the best, atleast in the top 3) But he isnt the best choice of maintainer. And yeah, he did pretty well with 2.4, but it wasnt as good as it could have been. And also, ive been noticing, alot of people disagree with me on this, that the head developer shouldnt be the head maintainer. But how many projects that are this large can you name? Like, i dunno, xfree? That has questionable maintainability. Gnome? KDE? They are fairing okay, but It could be better. And I like the kernel qa group idea, but where would we get the people to be on it? ac and lt are usually too busy, tho, atleast with ac (in top 3 of coders, best linux maintainer we have ever had) 2.5 would get maintained well so linus can focus on coding like I belive he should be. Im a coder myself, so I know how hard it is to maintain a project when it gets big. (I kinda get bored of it like linus does) 

Also, alot of people have been saying that I dont know about the section maintainers, like that dave m guy is a maintainer for the network stuff, im talking more of a kernel wide maintainer. Which brings another point. We have per section maintainers, but no real dedicated development tree kernel wide maintainer.
