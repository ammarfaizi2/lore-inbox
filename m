And do you think that given the opportunity, any company is going
spend the extra money required to not do it in the worst possible
way?? Companies want to spend as little as possible on drivers, and
drop support as soon as it makes sense financially to do so, they
aren't going to come to the correct best possible way on their own, or
via consortia of companies ala CEL or OSDL, they require outside
pressure to make them change their mindset from the only example they
have which is developing Windows drivers..
