Looking at the recent posting on lkml, I find that
a lot of people tend to take and apply patches posted
on lkml into proprietary modules.

I would request everyone to post their patches with
a license, failing which it should be assumed that
the license is GPL.

People picking up patches, please ensure that if
you are going to release only the binary of your
module, then please do not pick up code from lkml
and put it into your modules, unless you agree with
the license.

If what I have said is not agreeable, please
come up with a license for patches. This will
keep confusion to the minimum.

Comments,
Balbir
