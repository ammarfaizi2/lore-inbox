Hi friends...

  Please, I want to use (and maybe offer to my LAN) some tool to translate 
words/documents between two languages (english-spanish, spanish-english)...

  Which is the best way?... I was used "dict" but the list of words is 
incomplete.

  Do I can use kbabel, aspell or ispell to make translation english-spanish 
and viceversa ?

A lot of thanks.
