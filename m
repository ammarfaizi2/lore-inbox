It's not so much a "problem", but rather, most people aren't
particularly interested in using the millions and millions of
transisters of a modern CPU to generate a square wave.  So OS's aren't
optimized to do that.  Linux has no problems running many serial
ports; but in their normal designed function, which is to send and
receive characters, using the UART's FIFO's and interrupts to do so.  

The question of manually toggling DTR/CTS RS-232 lines to generate a
tone is something that you *can* do, but you won't be doing anything
else --- and that's simply because fundamentally that's a very silly
thing to do.  Most people will use a tiny amount of dedicated hardware
--- like the sound care that is built into every single modern PC ---
rather than manually waggling the RS-232 lines in order to generate a
tone.

You *can* do it, and we've described how to do it.  It won't be
efficient (you won't be doing much else), but that's because a PC and
Linux is optimized for different set of tasks.  Sometimes dedicated
hardware is the far superior option to a general purpose OS and a
general-purpose hardware.  This should not at all be surprising.
