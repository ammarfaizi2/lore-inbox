You don't have to, the weather does that.  The std joke question for anyone 
from a Northern CA market tv station who goes to Seattle to interview for 
a job at a larger market tv station is:  Was it raining?  And the answer 
is always yes.  I never saw it fail. :)

Reminds me of a fellow I worked with back in Iowa City, studying to be a 
lawyer (about 50 years ago) who spent most of WWII in London.  In two 
years the sun came out for 3 days.  He wears the scares from the sunburn 
he got to this day if he hasn't passed, he was about 20 years older than 
I, and I'm 72 next week.
