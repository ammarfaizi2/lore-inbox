Yes, Phil Burk is still doing music ... no, he's not doing it in Forth, but
in Java. Hunt up "jmsl" and "jsyn" for the details. I haven't heard much
from Jack recently; I have his book which had an ANS-ish 16-bit DOS Forth on
a floppy. At one time, I was doing some absolutely *amazing* things with
16-bit Forths on my HP100LX Palmtop PC. Still, I must confess I haven't been
to the Taygeta Scientific Forth archive in over a year.

Well, I want a full-strength Forth in my Linux box -- I've got SwiftForth
Pro on my Windows system and I'm holding out for something of that
comprehensive nature on Linux. I have to admit I haven't played with the
gForth that I think comes with my Red Hat distro, so I don't know what it's
like. I've heard hard-core Forthers gag profusely at the mere mention of
gForth.

So, enough "old Forthers home week" on the Linux kernel mailing list, eh?
