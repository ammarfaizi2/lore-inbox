I installed Red Hat 7.0 with kernel 2.2.16-22 and then I installed kernel 
2.4.0-0.26 and when i reboot my computer it said that it could not find my 
sound card "AC '97 Sound Card" and My USB mouse that was configured in the 
prevesse install.
Just to let you know about my Gateway P566
"i686"
Thank you for you time Victor
