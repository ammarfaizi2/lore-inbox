Naturally. Evaluate the assembler when it's done.  Normally an 
unconditional jump takes less cycles than a conditional jump.  It's hard 
to argue with that.  Use the right tool for the job.  If the code 
expression necessitates a goto within a block of code to keep things 
neat and orderly, then do it.

Regarding the if () { ... }, there are no braces around the assembler 
code.  It's all a matter of linear instructions with jumps.  An if() { 
... } is a prettiness for our human eyes to organize code.
