Hi, I just finished a patch for the watchdog built into a single-board 
computer.

Anyway, should I also author a 2.4 version of this driver?  Or should I 
not bother?  I figured since it's the embedded space, perhaps lots of 
people are still on 2.4 for various reasons...

Also, who is the Watchdog maintainer?
