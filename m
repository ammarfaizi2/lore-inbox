Nothing, indeed! But what is wrong about those who strive to make
software Free for all?

What Stallman and others do is to incentive people to make Free
Software. I ask you, here and now, "Please, make all software that you
write Free." What is wrong with this? I'm not taking away your freedom
with this request. Then I say "I won't use your software because it is
not Free.", and "Don't use software that is not Free." Again, what is
the problem? It is really a good thing. Without all the Free Software
there was and is, Linux would be a fraction of what is today. Without
the GNU system, I, for one, would surely not run Linux!

We must let people fight their battles. And the Free Software battle is
a noble one!
