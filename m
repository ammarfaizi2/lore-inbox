Why don't you read the whole thread.  I'm not pushing any rules, and 
I've been replying "to the top" of emails on LKML for almost ten years.  
If your mailer wraps lines wrongly, that's the fault of your mailer.  I 
haven't had problems with mixed up quoting.  Not all software is created 
inferior..  I don't have to reply if someone else has already stated 
what needed to be said.  If you don't like my quote-above-reply, then 
filter my emails.

p.s. If you want to follow the 'rules' of RFC 1855, then there are 
several this list is 'breaking', this RFC is informational, a guide.  
Not law.  Your message violates RFC 1855.
