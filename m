I've made available a patch that makes some alterations to my key management
stuff, mainly to support keyfs. The patch can be downloaded from:

    http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/keys/keys-268rc4mm1.diff.bz2
    Signed-Off-By: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

To summarise the changes in this patch:

 (*) There are now five permissions instead of three, which makes things
     easier. Hopefully it also means that people will stop thinking keys have
     UNIX access permissions, which they do not.

 (*) The key "chmod" operation is now "setperm".

 (*) fsuid/fsgid are now used instead of euid/egid when using permissions.

 (*) Some stuff has been moved from the internal header file into
     include/linux/key-ui.h to make it available to keyfs.

 (*) /proc/keys is now disabled by default. It pretends keys don't exist
     unless you have at least one permission on them.

David
