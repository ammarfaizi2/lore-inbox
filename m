We don't need a 2nd BSD license, one is more than enough. Let Linux and
BSD offer alternatives. Of course given the relative success of Linux and
BSD I think we can safely say that the decision has been made as to which
will be more appealing to users, although I'm not totally sure why.

I actually prefer a license which says may be freely used in open source
freely redistributable software, and otherwise requires a commercial
license with royalty. In other words, "this is my gift to humanity to be
freely used and enjoyed. If you insist on limiting or concealing it I want
to make money on it, too."
