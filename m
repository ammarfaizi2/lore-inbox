It seems that what you are really looking for in your application is a 
monotonic clock. Linux has such thing since few releases. Using 
CLOCK_MONOTONIC (cf "man 3 clock_gettime") may look much less hacky than 
using the uptime ;-)

Now... concerning the suspend effect on this clock, I don't know. It's 
probably the same problem as uptime: no official semantic has ever been 
stated yet... Does anyone know?
