hello all

sorry about this question but i didn't understand something in all this 
"trade secret" situation...

first: Is there any impact in GNU GPL?

second: does this US law means that everything could be a "trade 
secret"? even something like the  GUI? or a process bar? and in case 
that someone will register them what is going to happens?

third: this under US law, is it applied in EU etc????

thanks for your time
Christos
