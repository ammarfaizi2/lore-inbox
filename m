I see, so there is a personal axe to grind here also.  I wasn't aware 
of that.  That places this a lot closer to the trolling scenario (and 
a waste of time and bandwidth) than a fox in the henhouse then.  And

be interesting.  All in all, an enlightening thread now, thank you to 
those that were there to record history. :-)
