Hello, everyone,

The quick question: if I install PPP 2.4.1 in a Linux box w/ kernel 2.2.x,
will I have support to MLPPP??

Now, the explanation for my doubt. I've seen several (actually 3)
different MLPPP implementations for older versions of PPP/pppd (namely
2.3.5 and 2.3.11). I'd like to know if once I install PPP 2.4.1 in a
system w/ kernel 2.2.x, I kill my need for these kind of patches in order
to support MLPPP. Or would I still need some kind of patch, even for PPP
2.4.1, to have MLPPP support in kernels 2.2.x??

I know that for kernels 2.4.x these patches are not needed.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Later,
Ivan
