Release 2.1 of kernel build for kernel 2.5 (kbuild 2.5) is available.
http://sourceforge.net/projects/kbuild/, Package kbuild-2.5, download
release 2.1.

Basically a collection of the latest files from Release 2.0 plus some
minor bug fixes.  You know the code is getting stable when most of the
changes are documentation and white space from Lindent :).

   kbuild-2.5-core-6.bz2

   kbuild-2.5-common-2.4.18-5.bz2
   kbuild-2.5-i386-2.4.18-2.bz2

   kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.8-1.bz2
   kbuild-2.5-i386-2.5.8-1.bz2

Changes from core-5.

   Run pre-processing programs through scrips/Lindent.

   Document select_elsewhere(), require that select_elsewhere() objects
   begin with '/'.

   Document the interaction of link_subdirs() and base_target(), with
   particular reference to boot loaders.

   Refresh record pointer in run_db_child_recurse() after calling user
   function, the record might have moved.

   Correct handling of objects that are used in both vmlinux and other
   targets, e.g. boot loaders.

   Do not write back records when closing a corrupt database.

   Delete some old debugging code, left in by mistake.

   Correct refresh of timestamps on dependencies that are generated by
   other commands.

2.4.19-pre<n>, 2.4.18-ia64-020410, 2.5.8-ia64-020415 to follow.

Could other arch maintainers check their code against core-6 and
common-2.5.8 and either tell me that no change is required or send me
the updates.
