I have trouble with the APM in kernel 2.4.3.

I'm booting Win98SE and run loadlin 1.6a to booting the linux kenel 2.4.3. 
Everything goes ok, but my machine will not turn off if I use the command 
poweroff.

If I booting MS-DOS 6.22 from disk at the same machine, then running the same 
loadlin and loading the same kernel, then the poweroff command will turn off 
my computer.

I'm not sure if this is a kernel specific problem, but I don't know where to 
ask to help me.

I don't understand, whats the difference to load the kernel from Win98SE or 
from MS-Dos 6.22.

Maybe someone can help me.

Thanks

Frank
