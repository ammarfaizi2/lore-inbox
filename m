I hope you don't mind if I post this to l-k so Alan (and everyone), can
see (what a fool I am).

I didn't, but they probally aren't important at this point.  I got
2.4.8-ac10 to boot.  I was going to build a kernel that oopsed, so I went
to reverse off the -ac10 patch, but patch asked me to ignore the -R.  I
was like, crap, I just build a plain 2.4.8.  No wonder it wouldn't boot, I
didn't have ext2 built in.

Sorry for your time, and thanks for making me think this through again.

I'll repeat, 2.4.8-ac10 is cool for me now.

(And I got the college dorms online, that have been distracting me all
week, so I can think straight again. :)
