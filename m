Anybody who limits their ideology to (solely) how much (or little)
something costs, has missed the point entirely.

As such, poor college students shouldn't assume that their new world
religion regarding software should apply to everyone to the extreme
that they feel it should apply to. The benefits of Open Source are
*NOT* about money. The fact that Open Source projects tend to be free
is one of the effects of the theoretically optimal path that Open
Source ideology suggests is possible. It is not a *requirement*.

If Open Source, the Open Source being stouted, is so wonderful, how
about letting it prove *itself*. If anybody needs to boycott superior
products in order to allow Open Source products to compete, all that
it being shown is that the Open Source movement may *not* be the
answer. After all, if Open Source projects cannot compete with
non-Open Source projects -- how can it be claimed that Open Source
is a valid and practical ideology?

Open Source fanatics: Let your ideology stand up for itself. Don't
cheat.
