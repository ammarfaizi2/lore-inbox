Hi again! 

This is Natasha from Ecstasky Air, the world's first "Lingerie Airline". 

I'm surprised we haven't heard from you yet! When you have a chance, I hope you 
take a look at our latest updates at the link below...there is new video from 
new Nationally Broadcasted TV shows with some good shots of me and my friends 
in our 'uniforms'...and now you can BOOK FLIGHTS ONLINE securely and discreetly 
through PayPal. 

Travel agents can also offer our flights and get a commission on every ticket 
sold. With service that beats ANY airline and prices to match, how can anyone 
stand to miss this? 

Please feel free to give Don or me a call anytime at (310) 858-5700 or just click 
onto our website for more. 

Cheers, 

Natasha
