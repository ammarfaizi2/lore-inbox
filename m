I don't want to appear to be offensive in regards to this project
considering I have no prior knowledge about it other than what I've seen
at the web site just now, but it appears that there is a lot more talk
than coding occuring at this project.  It just appears that everybody has
wants but nobody is turning the wants into realities.  Maybe I'm wrong
(and I hope I am), but it just seems to be a bit vaporous.
