Quite interesting. But this is "Linus Torvalds" and not "Linus Tordval".

The only thing we can know is that they are using a 2.4.24-pre9 compiled
for MIPS. But, you're right on one point, the fact that they have
several version of the 2.4.24-pre9 with different sizes makes it really
really suspicious.
