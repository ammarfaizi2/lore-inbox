Hi,

Could you please stop carbon copying to Linux? I'd be very pissed to 
receive huge amounts of carbon copies about subjects that don't even 
matter to me!

About the Corporate Firewalls issue, even though Linus didn't like it, 
Hans Reiser submitted a few patches as Bitkeeper patches. It doesn't 
exactly seem impossible to me. Also, if you don't have the ability to use 
Bk for whatever reason, no one will ever forbid you to submit patches.

Regards,
Thunder
