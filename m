Hello

I am pondering on writing a Linux kernel specification, or rather
compiling it from the various bits that are online.

However I need to be sure that something like this is welcome at
all:

1) Is Linux kernel meant to be a separate project or is it a subproject
of GNU/Linux, Debian, Fedora, SuSE or whatever?
2) Is Linux kernel meant to be used by general public, or is it intended
   only for developpers of GNU/Linux, Debian, Fedora, SuSE etc.?
3) Is Linux kernel meant to have a specification and just a lack of time
   prevented it, or is Linux kernel meant to not have a specification?
4) If I produce a specification that is valid, correct and complete enough
   to be useful for general public, will it be included on the Linux kernel
   homepage http://www.kernel.org under a link "Linux kernel official
   specification" upon my request?
