I'm definitely unable to parse what you wrote, but I think that after:

- Larry has kindly sent me a message about my insertion in his killfile
- Andre is speaking about Pope, priest pedophilia and his intention to
piss me off (?)

the point that Dax made at the beginning of this thread is very well
taken.

I'm getting convinced that the point of some of the angry people Dax is
referring is:

"I strongly believe that RMS postings might corrupt the virgin minds on
lkml and unwillingly I'm forced to transform myself in an holy crusader
to defend them"

Believe me, it's childish. Nobody on lkml need/want to be defended.

Let people free to express their opinion (although they are definitely
false or supposedly so) and try to keep yourself and your comments as
calm as possible: you're a smart guy and your impetuous energies are
very well spent otherwise, as the past and present teach us.
