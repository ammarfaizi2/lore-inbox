It's perfectly fine with me ;)

We're working on implementing access control for
thefreeworld.net so the classified content won't
be available for citizens and inhabitants of the
USA.

This is done so we won't be liable for publishing
things to the USA which would be illegal there.

So if the SSSCA gets approved and open source is outlawed
(because only software with 'approved security measures'
is allowed) Linux should stop entirely ?

I don't agree that one US law, which hurts US citizens,
should also hurt the rest of the world. It's your country,
it's your law, it should only hurt you...
