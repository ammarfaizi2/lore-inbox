I have an AMD 80386DX40 on an unknown motherboard (it's sodlered to it :P)
and it never used to do this, but recently showed this in dmesg.

keyboard: Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?
keyboard: Too many NACKs -- noisy kbd cable?

I don't know exactly how long ago this started, since I was troublshooting
other problems (resolved, it was a routing + dns issue)  when I found it.

The thing is, I don't have a keybaord plugged in.  How can I have a noisy
keybaord cable if I don't have one?

It still routes internet services just fine, and it's only other glitch is
hte clock has been 30 years and a few months off ever since I turned it into
a router :)  Time is off too..  I haven't been worried enough about it to
change it tho.
