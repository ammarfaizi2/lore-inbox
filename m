Hi,

I know this is a bit OT but because here are the kernel driver hackers
this might be the right place to ask.

I am looking for a couple of PCI Gigabit ethernet adapters to play
around with SAN/NAS stuff like iSCSI and HyperSCSI and the like. There
are variuos adapters around which work with Linux. My choice would be
based on the following:

- Relatively cheap, around $100/EUR100
- 32 bit/33MHz PCI compatible
- Low cpu usage
- Busmaster DMA
- Opensource Linux driver
- zero-copy capable
- etc.

What card is best? 3Com, Intel or National Semi based?

Thanks,

Jurgen
