When enabling "Networking support" it does build. 

I don't have networking support enabled since I build this kernel quite
often against various patched and unpatched sources just to check if there
is any version out there that makes my SATA disk (AHCI) not freeze after
resume. So I want to build it quickly. (Till now, including this -rc1
kernel, no kernel "worked").

I attached the two .config files (with and without networking support).
