Hello Linus,
The i2c & lm_sensors group would like to submit these 9
patches from our stable 2.6.3 package.

This group of patches adds hardware sensor for boards and
chips.  They are considered stable and have been in use
since March 2002.

Over the next weeks we will be updating the kernel with our
beta release 2.6.4 and documentation patches.
Thanks,
Albert

+I2C mainboard interfaces
+CONFIG_MAINBOARD
+  Many modern mainboards have some kind of I2C interface integrated. This
+  is often in the form of a SMBus, or System Management Bus, which is
+  basically the same as I2C but which uses only a subset of the I2C
+  protocol.
+
+  You will also want the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
+  in the lm_sensors package, which you can download at 
+  http://www.lm-sensors.nu
+
+Acer Labs ALI 1535
+CONFIG_I2C_ALI1535
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the Acer
+  Labs ALI 1535 mainboard I2C interface. This can also be 
+  built as a module.
+
+Acer Labs ALI 1533 and 1543C
+CONFIG_I2C_ALI15X3
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the Acer
+  Labs ALI 1533 and 1543C mainboard I2C interfaces. This can also be 
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+AMD 756/766
+CONFIG_I2C_AMD756
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the AMD
+  756/766 mainboard I2C interfaces. This can also be 
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+Apple Hydra Mac I/O
+CONFIG_I2C_HYDRA
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the 
+  Hydra mainboard I2C interface. This can also be built as a module 
+  which can be inserted and removed while the kernel is running.
+
+Intel I801
+CONFIG_I2C_I801
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the 
+  Intel I801 mainboard I2C interfaces. "I810" mainboard sensor chips are
+  generally located on the I801's I2C bus. This can also be
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+Intel I810/I815
+CONFIG_I2C_I810
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the 
+  Intel I810/I815 mainboard I2C interfaces. The I2C busses these chips
+  are generally used only for video devices. For "810" mainboard sensor
+  chips, use the I801 I2C driver instead. This can also be
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+Intel 82371AB PIIX4(E) / ServerWorks OSB4 and CSB5
+CONFIG_I2C_PIIX4
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the 
+  Intel PIIX4 and PIIX4E and Serverworks OSB4/CSB5 mainboard
+  I2C interfaces. This can also be
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+Silicon Integrated Systems Corp. SiS5595
+CONFIG_I2C_SIS5595
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the 
+  SiS5595 mainboard I2C interfaces. For integrated sensors on the
+  Sis5595, use CONFIG_SENSORS_SIS5595. This can also be
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586B
+CONFIG_I2C_VIA
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the VIA
+  Technologies I2C adapter found on some motherboards. This can also 
+  be built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the 
+  kernel is running.
+
+VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C596, 596B, 686A/B
+CONFIG_I2C_VIAPRO
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the VIA
+  Technologies I2C adapter on these chips. For integrated sensors on the
+  Via 686A/B, use CONFIG_SENSORS_VIA686A. This can also be
+  be built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the 
+  kernel is running.
+
+3DFX Banshee / Voodoo3
+CONFIG_I2C_VOODOO3
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the 
+  3DFX Banshee and Voodoo3 I2C interfaces. The I2C busses on the these
+  chips are generally used only for video devices.
+  This can also be
+  built as a module which can be inserted and removed while the kernel
+  is running.
+
+DEC Tsunami 21272
+CONFIG_I2C_TSUNAMI
+  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the DEC
+  Tsunami chipset I2C adapter. Requires the Alpha architecture;
+  do not enable otherwise. This can also be built as a module which
+  can be inserted and removed while the kernel is running.
+
+Pseudo ISA adapter (for hardware sensors modules)
+CONFIG_I2C_ISA
+  This provides support for accessing some hardware sensor chips over
+  the ISA bus rather than the I2C or SMBus. If you want to do this, 
+  say yes here. This feature can also be built as a module which can 
+  be inserted and removed while the kernel is running.
+
+  You will also need the latest user-space utilties: you can find them
