The only problem with posting the full headers and source of the email, is
you might confuse Dave with the facts.  Remember:  We hate anything free
that isn't software, or anything "commercial" and will tar and feather you
until you comply with the will of The Party.  Dave will be around next
week to install your telescreen...

another former prole
