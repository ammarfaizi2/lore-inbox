Just got a Tyan Thunder K8W 2885 mobo with dual Opterons set up last
night, and mostly everything works in 32-bit mode, as I have not yet
done the research on how to get a 64-bit toolchain onto the machine.

One big problem, though: the kernel appears unable to assign virtual
memory to one of the memory mapped regions of my second (PCI 5V) video
card, an nVidia GeForce2 MX.  This results in its running in PIO mode,
which gives me, oh, about one frame/second when watching DVD's on that
display. :)

  PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 0000:04:0a.0
  PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 1 of device 0000:04:0a.0

where said resource regions are:

  Region 0: Memory at fb000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=16M]
  Region 1: Memory at b0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=128M]

I'll include the full dmesg and lspci dumps below, along with the
kernel config.

Just to head off the obvious first suggestions, I have indeed tried
booting with acpi=off and setting the BIOS to do different things (PnP
on, PnP off; ACPI on, ACPI off; I/O APIC on, I/O APIC off) and I
always get the same result, though there may be a combination I didn't
try that would fix the problem.  Nonetheless, I suspect there is
something more subtle going on here.

As a final point of information, the nVidia proprietary driver
rev. 4496 that I'm using doesn't recognize/can't use the AMD-8151 AGP
bridge on this mobo, so I'm using the AGPGART implementation instead
for accessing the first video card, a GeForce FX 5600.  The AGP
implementation I'm using, of course, has no effect on the PCI card,
but I figure some of that information might be helpful.

Anyway, the aforementioned dump comes after my sig.

BTW, I just wanted to say I've come here with plenty of problems over
the last 9 years and never walked away disappointed.  You guys rock.

Cheers,
Kyle
