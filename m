Sorry, wrong answer, but thanks for playing.

When Multics was developed, (early 60s,) DEC equipment wasn't even
interesting to much of an audience.  The original equipment Multics ran on
was build by one of the "seven dwarf" computer companies, (GE) which was
soon to get out of the computer business altogether.

I would suggest Organick's book, if I could recall the title.

Relating some "nine goals of 'Enterprise Computing'" to Multics is
the bullshit. When Multics was being developed, the singular goal
was to make an operating system that worked on DEC Equipment without
having to use DEC software. The emphasis was on trying to make it
work period.
