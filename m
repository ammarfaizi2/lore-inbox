Hello,
I saw that last month ,  9/2003 , a new book named :
Linux Kernel Development by  Robert Love  (SAMS) was published.

As I saw it also deals with 2.6 kernel.

If any of the members of this forum had the opportunity to
read it or part of it , I would appreciate if he would share his thoughts
on it in this forum. (especially comparing to other available books on Linux 
Kernel , which
their number is not large (especially the number of updated ones).

regards,
sting
