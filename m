Hello all,

This is my first post to the group and i would like some assistance with a 
question about kernel compilation....

I have an AMD K6-2 500 w/ 256 MB RAM, RedHat linux 7.2 and Kernel 2.4.16

When i try to re-compile my kernel it dosn't work unles i include SMP 
support.... any ideas why ? a few of my mates have the same problem !! 
(unsure of their system specs)

Any help appreciated..

Neil Stone
