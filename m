That's not true.  Section 1 of 'SubmittingPatches' is entitled
"Creating and Sending Your Change" while section 1 of your
bk bullshit is called "Bitkeeper Concepts."

All of section 1 is an advertisement for using bk...including
directions on how to setup your own clone.  Those are _clearly_
bitkeeper directions and have nothing to do with how to submit
patches.

Delete sections 1 & 2 and make section 3 the gist of the document
and _then_ you'll have the bk equivalent of 'SubmittingPatches.'
