I am a bit confused. Could you please comment on the following, as a
common test steps?

I am not sure how you wrote the above characters. According to UTF-8,
characters with codepoints above 0x79 require two bytes so that to be
valid. When you compose "รถ" (you press something like ";", then "o") in
the console?

For simplicity, let's assume you do something like
% loadkeys --unicode
keycode 53 = 0x0d2f
compose '/' 'q' to U+00F6
compose '/' 'w' to U+00F7
compose '/' 'e' to U+00F8
compose '/' 'r' to U+00F9
compose '/' 't' to U+0100
compose '/' 'y' to U+0101
keycode 2 = U+00F6
keycode 3 = U+00F7
keycode 4 = U+00F8
keycode 5 = U+00F9
keycode 6 = U+0100
keycode 7 = U+0101
^D
% 

Dead key (due to "0d") is the character "/" (0x2f).
Keycodes 2-7 are keys for numbers 1-6.
To test, I type
% cat > test.txt
<we try out all key compositions to generate U+00F6-U+0101>
^D

When we try keys 1-6, we get
% od -x text.txt
0000000 b6c3 b7c3 b8c3 b9c3 80c4 81c4 000a
0000015
%
which is correct.

When we try using the dead key "/" and q-y, we get
% od -x test.txt
0000000 f7f6 f9f8 0100 000a
0000007
% 

To get the keyboard in a sane mode, "loadkeys --unicode -d".

>From here we see there is no conversion to UTF-8 whatsoever.

In the second case, the kernel cannot return the full character when it
is in Unicode mode.

Good. I hope more people raise their hands for this.
