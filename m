Agreed.  Except maybe that one dollar sign is too much :)

This is misleading.  Revenue has nothing to do with whether the software
is open source or not.  Look at Digital's and IBM's billions that they
made as a service organization, where often there "proprietary" software
simply existed as a loss leader which opens doors to new service
contracts.

There is a pool of money that businesses have, that can be spent on
total IT.  At the end of the day, businesses don't give a damn whether
they are spending 80% on service, 10% on hardware, and 10% on software,
or, 10% of service, 20% on hardware, and 70% on software.  As long as
their business needs are met within the given budget, they're satisfied
to let the engineers dicker about whether OSS or proprietary software is
better.
