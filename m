Not much help here with the latest BIOS.  There is actually a release
1004 version today on the ASUS web site.

Pretty much in the same board as you Brian.  I will call ASUS today and
see if they can help me out.  I have an open Case with them(#44951),
maybe all you K8N-DL owners can start calling in and get some kind of
traction on this issue...Or at least talk with their Linux folks.
