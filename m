It won't. Because AI is handwaving patch over hack with the odd kludge for
lack of a decent, structured solution. If the problem is important, some
solution is found eventually, and the area doesn't qualify anymore ;-)

Happened to "automatic programming", to get a program written from a
high-level specification was an AI problem, until compiler technology was
born and matured. To be able to manage a computer system required a human,
until modern OSes. Today you have machines reading handwriting (sort of) as
part of PDAs, there is even some limited voice input available. Automatic
recognition of failed parts from video cameras is routine, work is
progressing on face recognition. It just isn't called AI anymore.
