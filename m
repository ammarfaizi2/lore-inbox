Trying to boot 2.2.22 on HP Vectra 90/5 gives and endless stream of these:

CPU0 Machine check exception 0x  10E2C0 (type 0x    09)

2.0.35 does boot just fine.

If I optimize for i386 instead of Pentium, I get a different MCE, but it
doesn't boot.

Compiled with
kgcc --version 
egcs-2.91.66

The /proc/pci, dmesg output from 2.0.35 boot are attached as is the .config.
