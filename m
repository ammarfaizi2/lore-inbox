A snippet of the Plan 9 license....


2.0     GRANT OF RIGHTS
2.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement and to third party
intellectual property claims, Lucent grants to Licensee, a
royalty-free, nonexclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to
use, reproduce, modify, execute, display, perform, distribute and
sublicense, the Original Software (with or without Modifications) in
Source Code form and/or Object Code form for commercial and/or
non-commercial purposes.  This grant includes a nonexclusive and
non-transferable license under any patents which Lucent has a right to
license and which, but for this license, are unavoidably and
necessarily infringed by the execution of the inherent functionality


The Plan 9 License was modified to resemble the GPL around Jan 2000 or so,
as was Kermit. I posted to linux-kernel on the matter at the time. These
two events changed the open source landscape substantially.
