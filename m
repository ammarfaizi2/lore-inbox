Come back when you are in position to make demands.  Until then, feel
free to bugger off.

Arrogant demands are _not_ going to impress anybody - $DEITY witness,
arrogance is not in short supply around here and with waay better
credentials to back it up.

If you are willing to help EVMS folks - go ahead and offer them your help in
cleaning the codebase up.  _That_ can change situation.  Public wankathlon
will earn you a warm spot in killfiles and fail to affect any merges in
any direction.
