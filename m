We (Lycos-Europe) are running Debian on several hundred Servers and as far
as I know the Woody Kernel's are not usable on most of this Servers.
So we are using a 2.4 vanilla kernel with some patches on these Systems.

I used the buzz word cause it was the standard answer if somebody asked.
I think there are many Admins who have to find a good 2.6 Release
and have than the work to maintain it. 
Doing it together will save a lot of time.
Only a idea, at least my english is not good enough to realize this.
