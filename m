I understand that users want to see these messages and I want them to
see these messages. (I did not emphasize this but I believe I never
stated something else.)

The problem is that TIOCCONS causes security problems.

Please rehash what I wrote in the thread. Essentially, these are my
points (citing myself here):

    the ioctl TIOCCONS allows any user to redirect console output to
    another tty. This allows anyone to suppress messages to the console
    at will.

[and in a later mail:]

    Changing the ownership on /dev/console causes security problems
    (that user can usually access the current virtual terminal anytime,
    and the current one may not belong to him).

Also I refered to a security advisory for SunOS which describes one of
the problems (hijacking):

http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1990-12.html

And I said that there are alternatives to /dev/console, and a commonly
used one is /dev/xconsole (see below how to use this). It does not have
the security problems and has other advantages (configurable via
syslog/syslog-ng). But it also does not receive the messages that are
simply written to /dev/console.

The latter problem still needs to be fixed, but is seldom a real
problem. AFAICS nowadays only scripts that run at boot time write to
/dev/console. The user has several ways to look at these messages
already (including watching the "console" window during boot or looking
at /var/log/boot.msg).

If you want this problem fixed, consider copying messages to
/dev/console with a demon to a logging facility. Have a look at
bootlogd/blogd.

All this can be done by using /dev/xconsole.

Changing ownership of /dev/console is part of the security problem. But
you can do that with /dev/xconsole.

Lars reported that xconsole breaks and proposed to simply revert the
kernel patch. His patch does not fix the security problems, it just
reverts to the old known-broken state.

Xconsole fails because by default it tries to use /dev/console. You can
avoid that by setting the resources to point to another file, e.g.
/dev/xconsole:

/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XConsole:
XConsole.file:          /dev/xconsole

Alternatively, you can use "xconsole -file /dev/xconsole".

When my TIOCCONS kernel patch is applied, xconsole should never try to
use /dev/console. We fixed this by putting the code that checks for
/dev/console into an #if in xconsole.c:OpenConsole():

#if !defined(linux)
           if (!stat("/dev/console", &sbuf) &&
               (sbuf.st_uid == getuid()) &&
               !access("/dev/console", R_OK|W_OK))
#endif

Later on in the code we use /dev/xconsole as the default.
