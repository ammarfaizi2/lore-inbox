Hi Folks: I have been trying to make the docbook documentation in the
2.5.3 tree but have run into a problem not having fig2dev.  I do not
seem to be able to find this utility or any reference to it.  It does
not appear to be in my docbook utilities at any rate.  Any suggestions
would certainly be appreciated.

  Kirk
