I have a Via KT266A motherboard with 2 integrated UHCI USB HCD's.
On an SMP kernel or with IO-APIC on UP enabled, they fail in the
following way:

usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=3D2 (error=3D-110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-1, assigned address 3
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=3D3 (error=3D-110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-2, assigned address 4
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=3D4 (error=3D-110)
hub.c: new USB device 00:11.2-2, assigned address 5
usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
usb.c: USB device not accepting new address=3D5 (error=3D-110)

With 'noapic', or with the IO-APIC disabled in BIOS, this works
fine.  This applies to 2.4.20 and 2.5.63 with the same results.

The system also generates fairly regular APIC errors 01 and 02,
which I posted about in a previous message, but results from=20
other operating systems make me disinclined to believe that the
hardware is broken.
