Dear all,



Well,
I've been receiving quite lots of nice and *warm* and joyful 
email for the thread ;-)

Some quite of enlightnment (including your email, Theo, it 
gives me lots of enlightment, you surely is a funny guy ;-)

After also lots of google clickings, I think I get the big 
picture of it now. And I've also made my decision. For now, 
I'm going to stick w/ Linux Kernel. And see how much can I 
give in till I give up ;-)

Thanks for all of the answers.
Special thanks for Rik van Riel and Bill Studenmund for your 
kind insights and supports :-)

There's a saying in Java-nese (not *that* Java) language:

Mangan ora mangan kumpul.

Which means, Have something to eat or not Have something to 
eat, the important thing is to stick together. Forever.

And that's what I felt about Linux Developers... if you know 
what I mean :-)

See you.

Best Regards,
arief_mulya
