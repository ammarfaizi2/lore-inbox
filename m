	If you do not agree with the EULA, you cannot and do not acquire lawful
possession of the work.

	Right, and normally the way you become bound by the GPL is if you do
something that you could not acquire the right to do any other way. That's
why GPL issues frequently hinge on whether you could not acquire the right
any other way. Possible other ways include first sale and fair use.

	Right, again, that's why it's important to look at whether they could have
acquired the rights any other way.
