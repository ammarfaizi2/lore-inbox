	Bullshit.

	This is a wake up call that admins need to keep installations up
to date.  When a security hole is found, I DON'T CARE if it's in a package
with a good security record or a poor security record.  It has to be
fixed and you can't put it off.  Certainly not in the current climate
with script driven worms like Ramen and 1i0n.

	Having a poor security record is a warning to the developers that
it's time to clean up their act and do better.  Sendmail use to be the
bug of the month club.  Hell!  It use to be the bug of the week club.  Last
couple of years, it's been pretty solid.  If you only went on security
track record, we would all be using MMDF, which is still arguibly the most
secure mail transport around.  MMDF has had what?  One advisory in something
like 15 years of deployment?  It was the default MTA in SCO Unix for
years and was mandated at military installations for a long time...  Still,
when that one advisory comes out, you better update or you are toast.

	You don't solely rely on packages that have "good security records"
never getting broken and then become complacent.  Sites that do that are
what we call "Warez" sites.  :-/
