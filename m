I was marvelling at the IBM Eserver ad in USA Today that mentions
UNIX(TM), a trademark of the Open Group, and does not mention Linux. A
handsome Arab-ish looking woman in a drab grey suit was raising her fists
while brandishing an Eserver. The suits seem to be winning. The phone
rings. Really. It's Verizon DSL with the deal of the century. Me "Does it
work with Linux?" Him "What's that?"

Me "Uh, it was an OS that showed a lot of promise for a while, but the
Beast bought it."
