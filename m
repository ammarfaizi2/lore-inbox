Marcelo,

Thank you for stepping forward to be the maintainer of the 2.4 tree.  This 
is a very valuable and important service for use Linux users.

Also, thank you for releasing 2.4.16.  I have it building on my linux box 
as I write this message :-)

Over the last few days, there have been lots of messages regarding "Kernel 
Release" and "-preX vs. -rcX".  You, as the official maintainer of kernel 
2.4 are the person who actually creates the release policy and makes it happen.

Would you care to share your thoughts on this matter?

David
