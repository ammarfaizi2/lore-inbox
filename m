Linux Capability FAQ v0.2 is available from

ftp://ftp.guardian.no/pub/free/linux/capabilities/capfaq.txt

Changes from v0.1:

  * Added Q6: How can I use capabilities to make sure Mr. Evil Luser
              (eluser) can't exploit my "suid" programs?
  * Added Q9: I noticed that the capability.h file lacks some
              capabilities that are needed to fully emulate 2.0
              securelevel.  Is there a patch for this?
  * other questions rewritten + spelling fixes
