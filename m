Dave, I have to tell you I don't like your attitude shown in this case. Surely
you can argue Rick does not really stay on a specific topic, but on the other
hand he does not really flood the list, does he? I mean, compared to (name
deleted)s' PR bubbles he is really low volume.
Besides I have not read any complaints (1 pro) - only yours. Which leads me to
think you kill him only because you don't like the man - and not really because
of his writing - and because you _can_. This does not feel alright for me.
Don't get me wrong, I am no Rick-fan, I don't know him and have no idea why he
is really talking about his favourite topics. But I honour his right to speak
up just like anybody else, even if it looks more like a "brainstorming" than
constructive talking.

Regards,
Stephan
