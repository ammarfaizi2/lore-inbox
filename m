I didn't see the previous patch either, but I wouldn't send
a patch for X11 support and anyone who does should be paying
attention to similar/other X11 patches, not necessarily all
lkml email.

Yes, Christoph must spend as much time per day as Alan does
on lk email and patches, but that's a good thing.
I certainly don't spend as much time as they do.
