Your architecture is i386? *Ad-hoc* solution is linking libgcc, 
thus you designate the following parameter during linking time:

	`gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

In addition, some architecture (sh, parisc) links libgcc.a.
Look at arch/{sh,parisc}/Makefile. (I heard such architecture's
gcc need libgcc for the basic calculation.)
