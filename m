	Hello. Since 2.6-preX series we are using XFS filesystem in the Spanish
 Debian mirror. The machine is under load most of the time, and I think that
 our periodic crashes (most of them occur only after some hours of operatio=
n,
 some in a couple of days) could be related to the main data filesystem.

	For example, today I rebooted the server. All is working, well, with FTP a=
nd
 HTTP concurrent access, and then I run the periodic script to sync up with
 official Debian mirrors. It is a recursive rsync over the whole tree, over=
 96
 GB of size. Now it's running 2.6.6 vanilla. The crash is:

	After that, the XFS fs is unmountable.

	The only remarkable thing is that the fs is on top of a RAID0
across two 180 GB IDE disks.

	I checked the filesystem with xfs_check 2.6.5 without errors.

	What I fear is that the kernel dies under XFS pressure. But I don't
have relevant info against that, mainly because the FTP/HTTP mirror
is the only source of pressure (i.e. concurrent accesses) in the machine.

	The data access pattern is ~200 users downloading big (~650 MB)
files (in fact, almost all the users try to download the same 3
main images).

	Other data:

Intel P4 2.5 GHz
512 MB RAM

	mount:

	I attach my kernel config.

	Am I overlooking anything? The box ran a complete memtest86 test
last month without errors...

	Many thanks in advance,
