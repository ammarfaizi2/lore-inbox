Subject: bk pull from bkbits screwy?

I sent a patch a while ago to change the bk:// to http:// in the docs,
but was told bk:// was working again.  Just did a bk pull again right now,
and bk:// doesn't seem to be working, whereas reparenting my repo to http://
and doing a bk pull works.  Am I missing something?
