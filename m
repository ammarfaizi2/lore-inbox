Hi!

I'm currently trying to get two Arlan 655 cards and an Arlan 630
access point up and running. Up to now, I failed. Unfortunately,
there's not much documentation available, the web sites mentioned
in the driver's sources are off the air since long...

Does anybody still use this old card? I'd like to get your config
(esp. module parameters) and maybe I'd scribble some small
./linux/Documentation/networking/arlan.txt ...

Up to now, the arlan.o module seems to detect the card, but card
and access point seem not to find each other.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,
	Jan-Benedict Glaw
