I'm sorry, owing to interference from the American Institute of
Parapsychology, the telepathic patch transmission service into the SCSI
tree has been discontinued.  The upshot is that if you apply a patch to
your tree, it doesn't actually appear in mine unless you actually send
it to the SCSI list and shepherd its progress.
