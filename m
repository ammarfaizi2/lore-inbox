Hi,

sorry for the late reply since I've been on vacation.

These messages are scary.  It means that the communication between the
controller chip and the codec chip doesn't work, usually incorrect IRQ
handling, and often due to broken BIOS or ACPI support.  Any change if
you pass pci=noacpi or acpi=off boot option?

Anyway, you can try alsa-git patch in mm tree.  It's a better support
code for Acer laptops, and this might work slightly differently.
