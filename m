Would the current state of athlon support be considered stable?
I've got a colleague interested in getting a dual athlon box, and
I'll be making the decision as to what hardware to purchase.  I'm
wondering is dual Athlon viable for a business solution right
now, or is it considered "experimental"?

What hardware would be recommended for a dual CPU system that
needs to be fairly rock solid?  Should I recommend to stay with
the P-III Xeon?  Or something else?  What issues would I expect
to have to deal with if going with a dual Athlon?

Also, what is a good rock solid SCSI RAID controller?  Money is
no object.  Reliability, performance and Linux compatibility are
though.

Chipsets to avoid?

Any experiences/info good/bad would be greatly appreciated.
