Actually, we can, and I will.

I do not look up any patents on _principle_, because (a) it's a horrible 
waste of time and (b) I don't want to know. 

The fact is, technical people are better off not looking at patents. If
you don't know what they cover and where they are, you won't be knowingly
infringing on them. If somebody sues you, you change the algorithm or you 
just hire a hit-man to whack the stupid git.
