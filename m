Hi, I am crrently runnig linux red hat 7.2 with a 2.4.7 kernel ( i havent 
upgraded cause i am a newbie and haven't had he guts to do so ).

However i am trying to configure the kernel 2.4.14 which i actually have even 
acomplished to compile.

I have a doubt though! I have an externel cd-writer ( hp 8200 ) which is 
supported by the kernel, but in the make xconfig menu, that options appears 
in gray ( u can't select it ). As a lot of kernel options need some kind of 
pre-selected items, i am asking anyone who  knows what do i have to 
pre-select so i can choose the module for hp..... support in my usb kernel 
configuration menu.

If i didn't provide enough information plz tell me so!

Crying for help: 

Astinus.
