Have you ever seen a manufacturer not putting his product at the top? 
When Microsoft folks make case studies about Linux+Windows, they come to 
the conclusion that Windows is better.
When Linux folks make case studies about Linux+Windows, they come to the 
conclusion that Linux is better.
Accordingly, a random benchmark picked from the web 
(http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x2100/) shows Solaris at the top.
And it's not surprisingly in general that a lot of manufacturers from any 
industry claim they're world-leading in fact they are clearly competing 
at the same level with a dozen other ones.
