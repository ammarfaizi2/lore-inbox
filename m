Download all the kernels. Be aware they are
	-	Wildly inaccurate
	-	Started becoming accurate later on
	-	Were subject to significant external effects (the RH IPO
		caused people to massively update/send in new CREDIT entries)
	

They still represent a tiny subset of contributors. Especially the thousands
who send in the odd small patch
