I don't know if this is kernel issue,but like to ask whos mintaining iwlib.
I tried to compile progs called wireless-tools and couldn't...Wrote
to program maintainer and got reponse:

"****Argh ! Again some header problem. Until someone fix the
include directives in iwlib.h, I don't know (because it works on my
distribution).****"

So if somebody could point me place where I could send my "make.out"
file for checking.

I'm using Mandrake 8.1 distro with kernel 2.4.16-pre1 and would like
to test wireless-lan and those wireless-tools are needed to get my orinoco
working properly.

Pse kind information....
