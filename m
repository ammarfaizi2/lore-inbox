Yup - just as they would have to hire programmers to port any program.

"There is no such thing as portable programs... only programs that have been 
ported"...

Neither has anything to do with Linux itself.. only that M$ suppressed vendors 
of applications...

X is a serious load unless you are expecting to work with multiple hosts, all 
sending windows back to the same server. In which case, nothing else works as 
well, nor as portably. Any standard X application can display to any 
reasonably standard X server.

And the problem is ????

The long development cycle has a lot to do with the lack of specifications for 
the hardware.

If the job says UNIX it implies Linux.. or so the ones I have been looking at.

So what.. I do interfaces using Motif. Can work fine on Linux or SGI...
GNOME/KDE is not quite as portable.

not true:
2 for "X Window"
10 for "X Windows"
13 for Motif

And that after only three shots... 25 total (I'm assuming there aren't any 
overlaps for the moment).

none of the located jobs are distribution suppliers.

The projects currently underway for doing the desktop haven't asked for R&D 
funds, to my knowlege.

HOWEVER - there were 15000+ workstations that converted to StarOffice last
year (DISA - a government agency). Since StarOffice works on both Linux and M$
I see that as a win. And there are a LOT of OpenOffice (the free version) 
installations.
