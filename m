Essentially it said:
"SCO=A2s lawsuit against IBM does not involve patents or copyrights. SCO=A2=
s
complaint specifically alleges breach of contract, and SCO intends to
protect and enforce all of the contracts that the company has with more
than 6,000 licensees."=20

Meaning after they shot themselves in the food, Novell told them "no no,
that won't work", they try to shoot the rest of it off, too.

However ..somebody must have realised, that this was nonsense and
removed it from the site.
