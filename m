At least with Linux, if something is *slow*, it generally works *perfect*
or damn near close to it.  I'll take that; over Microsoft's being slow AND
buggy AND just fucks me up.

I've lost soo much data on my disks - but ONLY on my MS partitions and
running an MS operating system.  Granted, I don't use Linux to access
ANYTHING that is FAT based (unless I use mtools).

I'm running with a VIA board, and I'll be happy to have something slow and
reliable, than really fast and really able to fuck my data up.  ;p
