I guys, i am not being able to put my externel hp to work!!!

I have compiled the new 2.4.16 kernel and made sure i selected scsi support 
and the specific hp82xxx suport from the text box in menuconfig!

But i have no clue how to put my cd writer to work under linux, at least to 
work as a cd-rom!!!!

can any of u give a clue where to read something about it ( linux doc has got 
NOTHING ), or even explain me slowly :P how to put it to work?

well all for now!

regards, Astinus
