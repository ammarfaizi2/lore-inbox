Subject: bkbits.net downtime
X-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Our T1 supplier, Global Crossing, is repairing a router at midnight 
Saturday PST.  Expected downtime is 3 hours but you never know.  If 
it turns out that they screw things up, we'll physically move bkbits.net
to a different location Sunday or Monday.  

Sync those trees...
