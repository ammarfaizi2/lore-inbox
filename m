Just letting you have a little insight into what their position might 
be. It's not bitter, it's
factual, and I got over Novell a long time ago. They will probably 
ignore you for now, but
in the future, if Linux contains IP from sources they consider theirs, 
it would be possible
for them to shut out competitors without a license from them. Not only 
on this topic, but
any other area their employees have contributed for which they hold 
patents. This case may
be a special one, but anytime you use patented materials are even areas 
where there is a doubt
there is exposure. I have a release from them and I can use any IP I 
retained in a non-tangible
form that would have been theirs. So I can use this patent without 
concern of infringement
claims. But since I did not instrument the affinity code in Linux, it's 
not protected this way.
NWFS is protected this way and people can use it without fear of claims 
from Novell.
