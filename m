Yes and no, pulling a modem/lan card out of my machine still causes an instant hardware lockup.  You have put a lot of work into it that I greatly
appreciate, but the 2.4 PCMCIA is still a festering wound for some of the hardware I have.  I'm not whining here, I know it'll take time to get things
working and I have one of the most problematic pieces of hardware in regards to 2.4 PCMCIA.
