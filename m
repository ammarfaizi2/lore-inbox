If an effort in this direction produced a "kernel-tester.tar.gz"
package, I'm sure lots of people with spare hardware would install 
it, and then check it once a day for oops or crashes, and mail in 
the bug reports....

I have the spare hardware, I just don't have the time to constantly
be downloading, compiling, and testing.  I'm sure I'm not unique in 
that respect.  

An automated system would probably bring thousands of new machines 
on board for continuous testing, keeping it a community effort. 

Not that the testing work of IBM, SGI, Red Hat, et. al. is 
unappreciated, but a distributed, open, regression testing package
sort of fits the Linux philosophy and model...
