How does tor.eff.org identify the oppressed users who have no other 
means of free speech from the flaming assholes who disrupt irc under the 
cloak of anonimity? Are you saying that there is no problem on freenode 
caused by these users, and this action is just a block for no reason 
other than a hatred of anonymous users?

In what sense "moved?" There is a channel, there are lots of people 
there, they are discussing Linux, they are making sense... If you mean 
YOU have moved to a channel of the same name elsewhere, or that people 
you think are important, helpful, or whatever have moved, fine. But 
unlike some of the other channels which come up with a note saying they 
have moved, #kernelnewbies continues to exist and be used. By people 
willing to answer a question, even.

Freedom of speech is an odd thing, people think that they have lost it 
if a publisher will not publish their material, however you define 
publisher and media. I don't personally believe it includes the right to 
force me to listen, or disrupt ongoing conversations.

Both USEnet and E-Mail have been flooded by people claiming freedom of 
speech. In the battle to keep the Internet useful, there is collateral 
damage, and it sounds as if this is what's happening. You would be far 
more accurate to say that freenode has made a different balance between 
freedom for people willing to identify themselves and freedom for 
everyone without regard for their content. Terms like "no longer 
supports freedom" are not helpful.
