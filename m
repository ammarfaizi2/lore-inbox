The Nvidia drivers are not open source. Please stop pedalling this myth. All
you are doing is risking confusing other unfortunates into buying nvidia
hardware and finding there is no open 3D support.

So tell me why I keep getting people who remove the Nvidia drivers and have
their machine work. I'm sure some of them are hardware related issues, but
all of them ?
