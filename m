That stuff is wildly off-topic.

Why? Are you planing to take anything from Hurd? Or complain that they
(legally!) are taking GPLed code and use it elsewhere? In the fist case,
discussion about the _technical_ merit of the code to swipe is on-topic,
all else isn't. The second case is none of your business, (unless you wrote
the code and did not GPL it).
