I wonder, did anyone else get this email?
It seems to be a reply to a message that I posted on linux-kernel in 
October 2000(!).

Hi Walter (I am sorry about last email, didn't mean to mess up your
name!), 

I heard that you know quite a bit about kernel stuff, and I was hoping
you might be able to help me out.  I am currently looking for a
performance analysis person who has done kernel tweaking and tuning and
has experience with Spec SFS.  Do you know anyone I could talk to.  This
is such an urgent position, that even if someone wasn't looking, perhaps
I could talk to them more about the position - they might know
someone...  By the way, I also have several different kernel development
roles... if you happen to know of anyone who might be interested at
seeing what is out there right now.  These positions are in the Bay Area
(California).

Thanks for your help!
