Aah. I see. Where was this? I never saw it.

That may be so, so hack up your own OS. It's a MOBILE PHONE, it needs to be
absolutely *rock solid*. Look at the 5110, that's just about perfect. The
7110, on the other hand ...

There are Linux advocates, but I'd say most of us are sane enough to use the
right-tool-for-the-job approach. And UNIX on a phone is pure overkill.

Your sister won't notice much advantage. Linux on a workstation actually has
*disadvantages* (unfamiliar interface, unintuitive same, etc), as opposed to
'Doze on a workstation. Sure it's more stable, and the tiniest bit faster,
but what's that really matter to your sister, if she can't even figure out
how to use it?

-d, who owns a 7110 and can lock it solid, or get it to do funny resetting
tricks, at least once every 2 days
