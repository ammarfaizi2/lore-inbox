	I find quite amusing your notion of reason and balance.  Or
rather sad...

	No.  Reverse engineering is first a way of learning, then a
safeguard... if you need to learn (for there are no docs) and if you
need a safeguard (for you can't trust the vendor), then you need the
possibility of cloning.  Both of these conditions are much more likely
present in non-free software.  If both of them are fulfilled, it is
also very likely one will need to create a clone, but not necessarily
so.

	That you get so jumpy at the mere mention of reverse
engineering should have rang bells everywhere long time ago, not only
at the FSF proverbial HQ.

	I assume you meant copying.

	No one is threatening to copy your source code.  People only want to
create a clone, not a copy: something that interoperates with the same
data structures, perhaps with the same user interfaces.

	Perhaps you are claiming the definition of protocols and data
structures as protected by copyright.  Perhaps, but it doesn't make
cloning less moral.  Laws and morals unfortunately are splitting
farther and farther.
