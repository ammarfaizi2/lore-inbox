huh?  how do you write an ASCII text virus.  if you can do that, I will
give you a cookie.

example, maybe:

email receiver, please forward this message to everyone you know and
then execute as root "rm -rf /"

(if you refer to vbs text attachments, then that is a different story)

said driver writer should not be uploading huge patches to the mailing
list anyways and instead should have a URL that points to the website or
ftp site with the patch on it.  if it is zipped already, then sending in
email defeats the purpose since I cannot view it in my email reader to
see if it makes sense. I have to be proactive about viewing it, so it
might as well be on a website or ftp site.
