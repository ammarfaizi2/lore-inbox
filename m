Again you want this to be generic. Its not nice to throw the scsi layer
an 'ACPI hotplug'. Instead it wants to receive a generic notification
that could also be generated by other events (eg ISAPnP or platform
specific drivers or from an IRQ handler etc). There is going to be more
than ACPI here and things like PDAs that spot hotplug via an io port
register need to work just as sanely.

So you'd want

	ACPI hotplug event
	Parse into generic form
	Callback in terms of device, channel, unit, event type not ACPI

Yep
