Subject: make/configuration/dependency bug in 2.4.20 kernel
Reply-to: shivers@cc.gatech.edu

X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I am not a member of the linux kernel-hackers community, so if this is the
wrong address for this message, please excuse my ignorance.

There appears to be a make/configuration/dependency bug in the
2.4.20 kernel found at
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.20.tar.gz

* Short summary
---------------
The build machinery isn't aware that the driver for the smc91c92 PCMCIA card
    /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/net/pcmcia/smc91c92_cs.o
depends on /usr/src/linux-2.4.20/drivers/net/mii.c.

* Longer synopsis
-----------------
- Unpack a fresh linux-2.4.20.tar.gz
- cd linux-2.4.20
- make clean	(just to be safe)
- make xconfig
- In the xconfig app, make the following changes to the initial defaults
  (I append the resulting .config file at the end of this msg):
  Network device support
    Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)
      EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers -> no [CONFIG_NET_PCI]
    Wireless LAN (non-hamradio) 
      Wireless LAN (non-hamradio) -> y [CONFIG_NET_RADIO]
    PCMCIA network device support
      SMC91Cxx PCMCIA support -> m [CONFIG_PCMCIA_SMC91C92]
  (You have to turn off NET_PCI, or else mii.o will get dragged in by
  that dependency and the bug won't manifest itself.)
- make dep
- make clean
- make 
- make modules
- make modules_install

On the final step, things will blow up with these final lines:
    make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/arch/i386/lib'
    cd /lib/modules/2.4.20; \
    mkdir -p pcmcia; \
    find kernel -path '*/pcmcia/*' -name '*.o' | xargs -i -r ln -sf ../{} pcmcia
    if [ -r System.map ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  2.4.20; fi
    depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/net/pcmcia/smc91c92_cs.o
    depmod:         mii_nway_restart_Rsmp_38badc13
    depmod:         mii_ethtool_sset_Rsmp_016c45d9
    depmod:         mii_link_ok_Rsmp_965e2742
    depmod:         generic_mii_ioctl_Rsmp_3af04aad
    depmod:         mii_ethtool_gset_Rsmp_fa204a84
    #
 
* Workaround
------------
If you compile for a notebook that doesn't otherwise need mii.o, turn off
support for smc91c92 PCMCIA cards and hope you don't have to use one.

* Request
---------
If y'all figure out a patch, you could send me email, so I can kill this
limiting workaround?

My .config file follows.
