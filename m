It's both.  We all know Linus doesn't have the time to keep
forward-porting our hundreds of patches so he can only include
patches into his kernel that apply to the exact same tree he
has at that day.

This (and the fact that Linus gets far too much email and patches
to look at old ones) is bound to make the Halloween deadline stick
for both submission and acceptance.

I hope.

Rik
