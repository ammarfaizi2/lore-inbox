hello all
i'am new to linux kernel
I have the following doubts with respect to integrating the code with linux kernel.

(i) Suppose i have a code which is generic and doesn't use any linux related buffer mangement like skbuff or kernel calls or timers.
Is it possible to integrate this code with the kernel.

(ii) is there any good web site which gives details on integrating with linux kernel

(iii) what are some standard methods for integrating a generic code into the kernel ?

Thanks a lot
regards
bobby
