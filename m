On the other hand, Linux is about freedom, even if it's the freedom
to shoot yourself in the foot.

I really don't see that we need to do much of anything to change our
development scheme.  I think that James Bourne's -uv patch series
is all that's needed, and that the only thing we need to do is make
sure there's resources available to keep it going (find it a home
on the www.kernel.org server, provide a link for it so people can
actually *find* it, and somehow provide for continuity in case James
gets hit by a bus or something equally unfortunate.
