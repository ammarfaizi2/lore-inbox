Sorry, I resisted for two days but can't anymore...
Should I start by saying "You are all wrong" to match the style of your
signature? Just kidding, no offence, please.

The reason of my email is completely different. It's just after you said
the word "offensive" I remembered some tale whereby a sheep was trying to
argue with the wolves and the wolves were trying to pretend the sheep has
the same rights but after a while they got so annoyed that they told the
sheep "you are really rude and offensive" and ate it justifying it as
a "self-defence".

How can a sheep argue with the wolves (even if they themselves used to be
sheep not so long ago but now having become wolves are quite happy with
their position).  There are two solutions: 1. for a sheep to be promoted
into the status of a wolf or 2. for a sheep to be eaten. Daniel, which one
seems more desirable?

Regards,
Tigran
