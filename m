Thanks for testing.

It would appear then that ALSA doesn't have a magic solution :)
It'll always treat the codec as a sound card when the sound module
is loaded.

Alan, you seem to be the one who added the original code to
i810_audio to skip the modem codecs.  Does this actually
do anything for OSS? That is, are there any modem drivers out
there that will work with OSS drivers?

If not, then I'd suggest that we simply remove the modem checks
from the OSS Code.

Cheers,
