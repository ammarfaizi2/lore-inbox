Hi Fruhwirth,

I don't want to take 'emotional' sides in this debate, but an
observation:

Re: "Enlightenment is a gift everyone has to fight for on it's own." If
I can contrast, Jari's code gets some good use/discussion because if a
question is raised, it gets answered *in detail* the same day (almost
always - I don't know how Jari finds the time). Now I am prepared to
accept your philosophy on life (to each his own) but OSS (open source
crypto even more so) lives (or dies) on the ability of the community to
support the software - and they will only do that if it can be
communicated effectively to the *users*. Now having been through your
web site (and most posts), I can see your interest in the subject, but
comments like this just don't help that communication!

I use loop-aes, and despite reading this debate each and every time it
comes up, not been convinced to change yet (still hoping for a
resolution and mainline merge though :-)).

Daniel.
