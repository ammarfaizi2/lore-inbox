Note the "relatively" in my statement. The UK is a _lot_ freer than other 
countries are now / used to be... Heck, as you say the UK is freer than US 
now (for how long is another question)!

And just ask us people coming from eastern European countries (I am born 
Bulgarian) what used to happen to people who spoke against the former 
communist governments when they were still in power... - Disappearing for a 
few months into a working camp without any notification to relatives or 
disappearing for ever without trace were not uncommon occurrences. That 
doesn't happen in the UK (AFAIK)...

And yes, the UK isn't completely free, but then there is no such thing as 
absolute freedom or you have anarchy. The only country that came close to 
political freedom (well, for mature men anyway) was the ancient Greek 
democracy...

But I am getting seriously off topic now so I will shut up.

Anton
