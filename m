A number of people have written and offered assistance with
kernel.org.  I appreciate it, however, we have in the past found that
it is more work for us to support a "helping hand" than it actually
*does* help... basically, if you're not willing to plan to spend some
considerable time on a daily basis, please don't even ask.  If you
are, and are willing to make it a long-term committment, then drop me
a note...
