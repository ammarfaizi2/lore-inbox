There is a fourth choice. For more than a hundred years of commercial
endeavor in the US and perhaps longer in other areas of the planet, the
solution to technically restrictive law has been to invent something
entirely new that implements the desired result in a way that falls outside
of the classifications written into the existing law.

It's the classic Church-Turing game. Writing a law necessarily creates an
explicit instance of a more general concept. These are inherently vulnerable
to sufficient creativity. 

Best to invent under the umbrella of a respected university and publish only
in obscure journals to maximize the other side's response time. 

Creativity is power.
