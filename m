>  Complain to nVidia.

yeah i did think about that, except
"
NVIDIA provides superior 3D graphics processors to the computer industry's 
leading add-in card manufacturers and PC OEMs. We do not sell any products 
directly to end users so we do not have a staff dedicated to end-user 
technical support. If you are having a problem with any NVIDIA-based product, 
please contact either the PC or board manufacturer of your product. 
"

So who writes the drivers??
