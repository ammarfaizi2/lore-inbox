Will Jens Axboes patch for CD packet writing for CD-R/RW make it in
before the feature freeze? I know Jens Axboe is busy with more basic I/O
stuff, but i sincerely hope it can be squeezed in before 2.6/3.0 is
released.

Most new machines are fitted with a CD burner and some have finally even
dropped the floppy drive!. Good desktop support is not only about
low-latency and scheduler issues (Good work though!).

Looking forward to 2.6/3.0 (or whatever the name may be ;-)
