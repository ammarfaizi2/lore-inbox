Maybe. I'm not sure how simple it will be to adapt, since there are several
"clocks", and the setting changes the ratios between them.

It's quite complicated. There are 16 clock ratio mode settings, a bus speed
doubler and a raw clock speed indicator. The mode table varies from CPU to
CPU, and not all modes are available on all CPUs.
