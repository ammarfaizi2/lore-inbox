What's "obvious"? Which part of HTTP download don't you understand?
http://www.aero.polimi.it/RTAI/

Get the thing, untar it, patch the kernel and off you go. Nothing's
missing here.

Or maybe you prefer CVS:
http://cvs.rtai.org/index.cgi/

Please, point me to the missing files or tell me that the above
sites don't give you packages you can download/compile/use to obtain
real-time. I've been using and coding in RTAI for the past 2.5 years
and I've never heard about this before.

Or maybe both Wolfgang and I misunderstood your explanation and you
were actually refering to RTLinux?
