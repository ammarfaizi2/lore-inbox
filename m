Ok, no problem.

Anyone not prepared to say their name obviously doesn't care enough about 
the issue therefore their needs need not be considered (pun intended). 
Considering you are speaking for others who as we said before do not care 
enough you don't speak for any one who cares anough so you should stop now. 
Sounds harsh? It's the truth. Think about it. At least you claim to not be 
an anti-bk person but that you speak for the many anti-bk people. I have to 
still read from a single line from one of those imaginary figures you have 
in your head...

I didn't say anything stupid. You did. And your reply is out of context 
because I am talking about disconnectedness.

I click URL and wait and wait and I get "could not contact server". No 
internet connection damn!

There are people who work without an internet connection and just carry a 
floppy around to internet cafes / work, etc. On occasion they use a CDR. I 
know people who do that. I do that when I go on holiday. Last holiday 
before leaving I burned the bk tree on a CDR and took it with me together 
with my laptop.

I worked for two weeks completely disconnected. The only means of 
connection would have been going to an internet cafe and using a floppy. I 
chose not to go into an internet cafe, I wanted piece and quiet for two 
weeks. Going to lookup a URL would have wasted time and money. If that 
isn't an inconvenience I don't know what is...

If you can't see how disconnectedness can be a problem perhaps you don't 
take enough holidays? (-;

Best reagards,

Anton
