It is not clear from their website that any products exist to be
supported.  Also, unless they are totally braindamaged, I would imagine
that all of their products will appear to the PC to be just like regular
ethernet network cards, but use a different physical transport layer.

Hmm, I wonder if I will be able to run tcpdump from my electrical outlet
and listen to my neighbour's network traffic, and take over their X10
appliance controls ;-).

Cheers, Andreas
