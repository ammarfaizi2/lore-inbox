Is there any effort being made to update the stuff in the Documentation 
directory?  Most of the files in there are massively out of date.  I'd 
like to work on it - but I didn't see an entry for documentation in the 
MAINTAINERS file.  I googled around for mailing lists for kernel 
documentation, but the two I found have been dead for some time.

I think the whole directory needs an overhaul, but there's a lot of 
people's work in there (and I'd hate having my work torn to pieces by a 
rank amatuer), and I'd like some feedback on where to start, what to 
leave alone, what's there for historical interest, and what is 
critically needed.
