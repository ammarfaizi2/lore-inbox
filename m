No offense, but you need to learn to quote relevantly, and snip where
appropriate.  

Also, the FAQ to the LKML specifically says to write your message below
the text of what you quote.

Anyway, I'm here to discuss the kernel.  The issue at hand was whether
the kernel should be renamed.  I didn't bring up the topic, I was only
chiming in with an opinion.  As the topic went on, things got further
off-topic as can happen.

"renaming of a kernel" is a topic relevant to a kernel mailing list.
