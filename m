Maybe you misunderstood who "he" refers to?

I took it as referring to the Alan Brown (the ORBS maintainer), rather
than to to Ron Guilmette (who doesn't want his DNS server to be used). 

I know that isn't what a literal reading of the quote and Alan's reply
suggests, but it seems to make more sense to me.

Alan can you clarify this please? (I know that this isn't particularly
on-topic, but now that it's been said ...).
