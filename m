Hi,

I am getting some problems with kmalloc. If I tried to
allocate more than certain memory then the system is
hanging while booting with the changed kernel. Can you
suggest me how to come out this situation. Can't I
allocate as much I want when I want to allocate in the
kernel. 


Thank you,
Chiranjeevi
