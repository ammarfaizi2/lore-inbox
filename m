Wouldn't it be nice if somebody could collect this sort of information for 
you?

I.E. patches get dropped, even when there's intense interest about them, due 
to sheer frustration burning out the patch's maintainer, and scaring away 
other potential maintainers.  (Is this NOT the case?  I could be wrong.  
Please point out the flaw in my logic...)

job of doing that...
