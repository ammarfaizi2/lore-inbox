Andrew Tannenbaum said the same thing in the early 1990s. That we're
here still having this discussion >10 years later is telling. Dr.
Tannenbaum might have been acadmeically and theoretically correct,
but, with a nod to OS X, the Linux kernel has proven itself by
implementation and has proven to be remarkably adaptable.

Check back in ten years. Or just come back when you've completed
implementing all the beauteous features you're selling.
