I hate to jump in here but this is just too much!

Hans, I remember well the bellyaching you did when you insisted on the
Linux developers merging Reiserfs V1 into the kernel. Did you not learn
from *that* experience? You have taken *some* criticism here which may
*not* have been flames at you until you flamed *first*. You have been
told by at least 2 developers here what you must do *first* before
consideration of merging V4. As of this writing YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED!
You obviously have not even read all articles posted here. When Jeff
Garzik said "I've already listed two rather large technical reasons."
You answered "They are?". You just continue your insane bickering, now
followed by picking up your marbles and leaving. Grow up.

BTW, I could care less whether V4 gets merged or not as I am *not* a
developer.

Bob
