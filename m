Hrm..  hehehe, well, it may be confusing, but I've accepted the public's
unwillingness to use the real term.  I am pretty flexible when it comes to
how people address things and just go with the flow.  If it's disc in
Linux, let it just stay that way, 'cuz that's what I'll use.  Otherwise,
it'll break when things start to use disk.
