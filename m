Someone's going to get sued over BK use eventually. (Probably not until
after Larry retires). But I don't want it to wind up a 'scorched earth'
mess where nobody can 'legally' use BK or develop on the kernel for it
while some messy lawsuit is going on.

But until Larry retires, I have found it much easier to think of the 
Bitkeeper license as the "don't piss off Larry license". Don't antagonize 
Larry, or directly mess up his business model, and you'll all get along 
find ;P
