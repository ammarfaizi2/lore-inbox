Go away. I will tell you one more time: it is _fine_ that you don't use 
BK. Nobody has ever asked you to, in fact.

So don't use it. Please. You don't like the license, and what it means. 
Agreed. That license is a legal document. Agreed. BUT THAT ISN'T THE 
ISSUE.

And that was NEVER the issue, even though you keep bringing it up. Again
and again. 

The issue is that you should not complain about other peoples choices. 
They are not _your_ choices. Never were, and never will be.
