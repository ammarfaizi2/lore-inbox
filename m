Sorry to bother you again with this issue, Alan... by 'AMD chipsets'
you mean BOTH north and south bridges (eg. 761 + 766) or does it include
also AMD NB + VIA SB combo?
AMD 761 + VIA 686B based MBs are quite common this days: are they "safe"
(do you have failure reports)?
Thanx a lot (you may guess, I'm about to buy some MBs) B-) ...
