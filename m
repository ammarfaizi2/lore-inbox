Does anyone have pointers to information on how to add support for a
network protocol to the kernel?

http://www.csn.ul.ie/~heathclf/fyp/fyp-final/fyp-final.html looks like
it may be helpful, and I'm studying include/net/*, and net/*.  I didn't
notice anything useful in Documentation/networking, but rub my nose in
it if there is...

If there isn't something useful out there, I'll try to take notes as I
go. 

Suggestions/questions/comments/complaints (mostly) welcome.  ;)

TIA,

Eli
