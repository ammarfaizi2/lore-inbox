Sure you can guess. That's all you'll be doing though.
As a representitive of a corporate entity it is important
that I not make promises that I can't keep. I would like
to provide all facilities under GPL or more liberal terms.
We have to deal with potential legal encumberances, and
that's a fact of corporate life. I can say that I want
to use GPL, that I plan to use GPL (which is true) but
I am required to provide notice that I may not be able
for legal, copywrite, or corporate poliy reasons to
commit to doing so. This is one of the disadvantages of
being a wage slave.
