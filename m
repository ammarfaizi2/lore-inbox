??? You tell us that this list is only made for official kernels?
In this case it would not flood my mailing box, no -ac, no -arca/-aa,
no -dj, no..., no ide-2.4, no experimental patches... NO DEVELOPMENT!

NOO. This list is also for bug report of RH/Debian/SuSE/connectiva... kernels.
The pourpose of lkml is not only the development but also to find the
stablest kernel. The errata of RH (and other) will help Marcelo and Alan
to find the right patches to include in the official kernels.
