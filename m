Now that on-board ethernet on the lp486e (also known as
lpe486 and as elp486 and as PWS and as `Reuters') works
out of the box under 2.2.19, people started asking about 2.4.
A patch is found at
 ftp.XX.kernel.org/.../kernel/people/aeb/lp486e.c-for-2.4.4
It works (has gotten all of two minutes testing).
Comments are welcome.
