Now i'm completely mystified.  Since I'm a member of BugTraq, 
I get full disclosure of the bugs that make it there.

Including the recent kernel bugs.

Since I'm in the position to see the problem before the solution,
I'd be happy to repost a summary of security-related changes
to vger, provided of course that I'm able to correlate the changes
with the advisories posted on BugTraq.

Of course, if Alan wanted to cc me on the kernel updates with the full
text of the changes, or if I had access to this new website, I'd still
be willing to repost.

Once a security issue is published to the global internet community
(via BugTraq, vger, or any other method) with regards to the open-source
componant of the linux kernel (i can't speak for non-GPL'd stuff of course)
in a manner consistant with full-disclosure, then I see no legal issue
with posting information that informs users of what fixes are made.
