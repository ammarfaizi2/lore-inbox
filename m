Subject: 2.6.15-rc1 fails to boot on eMac
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Linux kernel 2.6.15-rc1 (vanilla, not patched, compiled with
gcc-3.4.4) refuses to boot on my Apple eMac (1.25GHz G4). After
yaboot has loaded the kernel the output on the console is:

===snip===
Welcome to Linux, kernel 2.6.15-rc1

linked at	: 0xc0000000
frame buffer at	: 0x9c008000 (phys), 0xd0008000 (log)
klimit		: 0xc0242858
MSR		: 0x00003030
HID0		: 0x8410c09c
===snip===

and then the machine hangs. Normally the next line would be
"pmac_init(): exit", but 2.6.15-rc1 never gets that far.

2.6.15-rc1 does boot OK on my Beige G3 (w/ G4 upgrade card).

The build was done on a ppc32 host, so the new-fangled arch/powerpc/
shouldn't be involved except when there's new references to it from
arch/ppc/.

My eMac's .config is below. It's a 'make oldconfig' starting from
my working 2.6.14 .config, plus I've disabled a bunch of stuff that
shouldn't be necessary for booting.
