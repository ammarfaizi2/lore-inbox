Where can I get gdbserver source or binary package ... its not included with
Mandrake 8.1

On the web we can find 1000+ page talking about how to use it ... but I cant
find a place from where to get it.

thank you

If you can see it, but it's not there, it's virtual. 
If you can't see it, but it is there, it's hidden. 
It you can't see it and it isn't there, it's gone.
