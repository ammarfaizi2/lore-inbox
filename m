But I don't sell service, or support. I sell *software*

Oh. But I don't give you the source code to my game. Crikey - How are 
going to debug it if it breaks??? Am I bad again ?

Gosh, they are naughty aren't they. But I can't release the source 
either, because little jonnie and his mates will all copy it and I'll go

Am I a bad man ?
