If you're planning to make money off of any code developed based in  
part off of the Linux Kernel, you should definitely contact a lawyer  
familiar with the linux kernel and ask them.  Any advice you get from  
this list should probably come prefixed with "IANAL", and as such  
isn't worth terribly much.
