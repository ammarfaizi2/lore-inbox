But that's exactly my point. These companies are (in the long run) just 
shooting themselves in the foot.

Sure, they still exist. But they are a niche market (and, btw, you can 
almost always tell which programs still do it: overpriced products for 
niche markets that don't have enough competition).

Any area where there has been even an _ounce_ of competition has dropped 
the DRM crap like a hot potato, because users wouldn't stand for it.
