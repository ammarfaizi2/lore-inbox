I mean, that it looked all good, the driver seemed to be operational,
but I did not get any Sound out of it. I stress, that this only happened
when everything was compiled into the kernel. Therefore, I did not use
a special modprobe.conf or such.

Now that it works, I can try again to compile everyting into the kernel
to do a second check. I will do later today and let you know the
results.

at first none, and now this:

	# This file was automatically generated by alsa-base's debconf stuff
	alias char-major-116 snd
	alias char-major-14 soundcore

	options snd major=116 cards_limit=4 device_mode=0660 device_gid=29 device_uid=0

	alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
	alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
	alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
	alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
	alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss

	alias snd-card-0 snd-via82xx

	alias snd-slot-0 snd-card-0
	alias sound-slot-0 snd-slot-0
