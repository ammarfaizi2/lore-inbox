Hello to all

I think, this is interesting

# queso microsoft.com:25
207.46.197.100:25       * Novell Netware TCP/IP

This is piracy or Microsoft buy licensed Novell?

And what it mean - that Microsoft can't guarrantie even himself 
against viruses, hackers etc., so used no his own IIS, but Novell? 

In any case, I think that this fact can be exellently used for 
Linux Public Relation and advertizing.

Best regards,
