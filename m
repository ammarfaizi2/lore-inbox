Almost got the new kernel working fine... ( am sending this from a pc
running 2.5.73 now )

One of my main problems now is strange behavior from the cdrom...

As reported by the startup:

Scsi0 SCSI Host emulator IDE ATAPI
Vendor: Memorex 48MAXX 2448AJ Rev SWS3
Type CDROM

appreviated from the orignal text:

fstab has entries for /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom when viewed under
2.4.22-pre1, and mounts fine.

When I boot 2.5.73,  /dev/cdrom and /mnt/cdrom disappear. I can manually
mount a cdrom to a new mount point using /dev/scd0 and can then view the
cdrom normally.

However, if I mkdir a new /mnt/cdrom, and even if I can fstab to make a
new entry that uses /dev/scd0 instead of /dev/cdrom, /mnt/cdrom still
disappears next time I reboot, even if I go right back into 2.5.73

Any ideas? This is really strange, and while I can work around it, a lot
of programs like wine can't work without /mnt/cdrom and /dev/cdrom.

Help!

PS Next problem is getting ALSA to find my C-media 8738 sound card...
