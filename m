Hello all,

I have had some mysterious errors that aren't totally fatal in 
themselves but have led me to reset my machine whenever it happens.  I 
decided to investigate further by using a seperate console to examine 
things when it happens.

My system:

ECS K7SEM w/ Athlon XP 2100+
512 mb pc133 sdram
WD800-JB hard drive  (hda)
Acer dvd-rom  (hdc)
Kernel 2.4.22-pre8

My problem is easily repeatable while watching dvd's through mplayer but 
has also occurred using xine and with high bitrate vob files (on disk as 
well).  I'll be watching something and then at no spot in particular in 
the movie(s) mplayer begins to freze and page.  At this time I get these 
messages on the console:

hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x21
hda: error waiting for DMA
hda: dma timeout retry: status=0xd0 { Busy }

hda: DMA disabled
ide0: reset timed-out, status=0xd0
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }

hda: drive not ready for command
ide0: reset timed-out, status=0xd0

end_request: I/O error, dev 03:01 (hda), sector 2360

end_request: I/O error, dev 03:05 (hda), sector 27514
<more...>
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:01 (hda), sector 196650
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,1)): ext3_get_inode_loc: unable to read 
inode block - inode=24699, blo
ck=98325
Aborting journal on device ide0(3,1).
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:01 (hda), sector 550
Remounting filesystem read-only
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:01 (hda), sector 2
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,1)) in ext3_reserve_inode_write: IO failure
EXT3-fs error (device ide0(3,1)) in ext3_dirty_inode: IO failure

I have seen similar DMA errors on this list lately but none exectly the 
same or with my drive / ide chipset combination.  I am fully willing to 
experiment here and if you would like more information just say the 
word.  I thank you all for your help!
