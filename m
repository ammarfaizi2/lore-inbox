Is there a script people can run which will dig all necessary system 
informaion out of /proc so that when one wants to report a bug, they 
just run the script and dump the output into the lkml email?

I see lots of bug reports which provide very similar kinds of 
information.  It seems to be so common a thing to do that it should be 
automated, no?
