Hello,

I'm having problems booting linux on my IBM Thinkpad A20 laptop.

Having got the machine working nicely with Debian "woody" I decided to
upgrade to 2.4.5 - which caused no end of problems, as it would fail to boot
correctly.

It would freeze at:

Freeing unused memory 242k ...

So, at the point I upgraded to -ac23 which worked fine.
So then 2.4.6 comes along, and I have exactly the same problem.

Are the 'ac' release not incorportated into future releases?

Thanks for any help in advance.

Chris
