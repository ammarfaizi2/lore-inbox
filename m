You can do reliability analysis in mechanics (given the necessary data
are available). But you can't do so in jurisprudence. There are
differences between jurisprudence and mathematics and physics.

Of course somebody doesn't need to consult lawyers if he doesn't have
doubts about his compliance to law or if he can live with any such
doubts. The original poster seemed to want to clear up doubts.
