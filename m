[Please Cc: me in your replies because I am currently not subscribed
 to linux-kernel.  Thank you!  :-) ]

Hello Alan and others,

Thanks a lot for the 2.4.2 kernel and the latest patches.  I really
appreciate all your hard work.  :-)

I just upgraded to 2.4.2-ac8 from ac6, but to my dismay, my PS/2 mouse
stopped working.  (i.e. "cat /dev/psaux" would give a "No such
device" error message.)  Either the kernel couldn't detect it, or the
driver wasn't loaded?  Not sure.  Anyhow, I rebooted my machine to ac6,
and my mouse works again.

I have attached my .config in this message.  I have CONFIG_PSMOUSE
turned on, so I guess I didn't misconfigure it?  Dunno.  :-)

Thanks,

Anthony
