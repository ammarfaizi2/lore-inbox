Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas account($2,000.000.00 USD) 
Two million United States Dollars) from a Bicici Bank here 
in one of the Africa countries, I want to ask you, If you 
are not capable to quietly look for a reliable and honest 
person who will be capable and fit to provide either an 
existing bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can 
serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain 
honest to me till the end for this important business
trusting in you and believing in God that you will never 
let me down either now or in future.

I am the Auditor General of one of the Bicici banks
here in Africa, during the course of our auditing,I 
discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank 
in 1996 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account 
again,after going through some old files in the records I 
discovered that the owner of the account died without a 
[Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not 
remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for 
nothing. The owner of this account is PEDRO F. BONNER a 
foreigner,a great industrialist and he died since 1998.No 
other person knows about this account or any thing 
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that until his 
death he was the manager GOLD ARK.

We will start the first transfer with One million
[$1,000.000] upon successful transaction without any
disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount to your account.

The total amount involve is Two million United
States Dollars only [$2,000.000.00]. I want to first
transfer $1,000.000.00 [One million United States Dollar] 
from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad 
before the rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only 
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be 
approved to a local person here, without valid 
international foreign passport, but can only be approved to 
any foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c because the money is in US
dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner too, 
and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together when we meet face to face after the first
transfer of $1 Million before transferring the second
part of $1 Million. I am revealing this to you with
believe in God that you will never let me down in this
business, you are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business, so please reply
urgently so that I will inform you the next step to
take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together
immediately after the first transfer before we fly to
your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this
business. I need your strong assurance that you will
never, never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank
official can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account that you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
Will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence you can call me for heart to
heart discussion through my email
address:marybangura@libero.it or call on +225 0747 3798
which I secured for the security and safety of this
business as you know that this business is
confidential.I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from
the relevant ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.

Yours truly,

MRS.MARY BANGURA.
