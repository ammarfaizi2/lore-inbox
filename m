It is a huge environmental problem if you're burning fossil fuels to
generate that power.

Anyway I didn't mean there's no point trying to save power on the
desktop, just that it doesn't seem to be a big concern on LKML.  100% of
the arguments I've heard (before posting the above comment) were from
the laptop perspective.

Now that it's clear that dynamic tick will be ready soon, this thread
has outlived its usefulness, I'd like to let it die.
