really strange, me too.
now...hm, it all started when i upgraded from kernel 2.4.19 to 2.6.0 in late decemeber, the system worked very fine for a week or so (having great response times!) but then all of a sudden the problems started. 2 disks died. then my gigabit network card was only able to transmit 200kb/s (but this was really a hardware problem, a new card is working fine again, well...). a week later the next disks are having problems and i have yet to RMA three disks. and now the next two disks..., i'm getting insane ;) i can't see any EXT3 error anymore *g* the next disks will be reiserfs only to see other error messages ;) well, but that doesn't solve the problem of 6 disks within 2 months...this is so unlikely.
