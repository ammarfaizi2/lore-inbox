I've tried to come up with an idea to automatically
benchmark user interactivity with the machine and
have put this idea in the Linux-MM wiki.

http://linux-mm.org/wiki/moin.cgi/UserInteractivity

If you have any comments on this proposed method or
would like to volunteer for coding it, please add
your comments in the wiki or respond by email ;)

regards,

Rik
