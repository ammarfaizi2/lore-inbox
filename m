Yes. We JF Project (Japan) is still keeping translating Configure.help
into Japanese for the stable kernel version 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4.

We have some interest in distributing our translated-Configure.help,
but, such distribution needs so-high-precious technical translation.
I think to leave quality control of Configure.help from developer
is not good, we have to be so careful, and it's a big problem.

In addition, I think we need a framework for keeping up to date with
the latest Configure.help against translated Configure.help.
Consistency between original Configure.help and translated-Configure.help
must be kept. IMHO, for example, if CONFIG_FOO is changed between 2.4.16 
and 2.4.17, then (translated-)CONFIG_FOO must show in original English,
even if we have only 2.4.16-translated-CONFIG_FOO, and so on.
