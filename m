Rather, they have not rebelled *successfully*.  The country
is in civil war.  The Taliban are not regarded as a legitimate
government.  Until shortly after 9/11, only three governments
recognized the Taliban diplomatically -- the Wahhabist Saudi
Arabia, the militarist Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
(The standing representative of Afghanistan in the United Nations
is *not* of the Taliban.)

Finally, Afghani women have risked their lives and been beaten and
killed for their protests and activities.

I witnessed a film just this weekend of an Afghani woman being
shot to death by a member of the Taliban.  The film was taken
by a woman who herself risked her life by carrying a video camera
under her clothing.

So, infer what you will about Mr. Cox's statement, but don't
breezily justify the death of innocent civilians (Afghani or
otherwise) in part by disregarding such all-too-inconvenient
details.
