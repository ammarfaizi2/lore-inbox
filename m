.. and then what does that mean? It means that we try to say that people 
cannot do what they LEGALLY can do? 

In other words, it means that we are pushing a agenda that is no longer 
neither a technical issue (it's clearly technically _worse_ to not be able 
to do something) _nor_ a legal issue. 

So tell me, what does the proposed blocking actually do?

It's "big prother, FSF style". And I say NO THANK YOU.
