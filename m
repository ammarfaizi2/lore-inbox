I sold the 1GHz, so I can't tell anymore.  I have a huge heatsink with
a Papst-fan. I have to admit that it was sold to me as being good
enough for 1.33GHz (by the manufacturer himself), but that shouldn't
be the problem, see below.

(If someone wants to know exactly:
http://www.tiger-electronics.de/english/cooler2.htm and look at
PDA38000BC, for a picture look at cooler1.htm SDA38000BC and pretend
you see the Papst-Fan on the top -- the pages seem to be outdated, the
invoice says the fan is good for a 1.33GHz Athlon).

Here's the data from the PSU's label:

Model: EG465P-VE
DC Output: +3.3V: 38A
           +5V  : 44A
           +12V : 20A
           -5V  : 2A
           -12V : 1A
           +5Vsb: 2.2A
     +3.3V & 5V : 220W max
    total power : 431W

I just switched the machine off for about 10min, and for good measure,
jumpered the board to 100MHz FSB, so the CPU runs at 1050MHz (thus
being well below the spec for the heatsink). It may have gotten a tad
further in the boot process, but if so, not much. Luckily, it never
reaches the point where filesystems get mounted rw...

Without the optimisation the machine runs smoothly with steady
cpu-load generated by a distributed-net client.
Currently I added a burnK7 and a burnMMX to the load, I'll see if the
machine is still alive in the morning...
