My Dear, 

After a discreet but thorough investigation 
at the foreign affaires office of the Lome chambers of 
commerce,I with absolute confidence in the legality 
of your company and Intergrity of your 
person essentially,the business I am about to commence with you fundamentally based on trust and sense of purpose. 

Briefly I am Mr. Alfred Dadah director in charge 
of auditing and account section of INTERNATIONAL 
BANK OF AFRICA LOME-TOGO. 

With due respect and regard,I have decided to 
contact you on a business transaction that will be 
very beneficial to both of us at the end. 

During investigation and auditing in this bank, 
I came across an amount of money 
belonging to a deceased couple, who died on EgyptAir 
Flight 990 plane crash of 31st october 1999. No body 
was recovered from the crash site. his is the website. 
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html 

This fund has been dormant in their account with my 
Bank without any claim of the fund that is in our 
custody neither from his family or relation before 
my discovery to this development. 
Although personally, I kept this information secret 
to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable 
successful during the time of execution. 
The said amount was $10 million US dollars(Ten 
million US dollars). 
Meanwhile all the arrangement to put claim over 
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the 
deceased,To get the required approval and transfer 
this Money to a foreign account has been put in 
place by me. Also directives and needed information will be related to you as soon as you indicate 
your interest and willingness to assist me in this issue. 

In fact I could have done this deal alone, but 
because of my position in this country as a civil 
servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my 
side during the time of transfer because I work in 
this bank. 

This is the actual reason why it will require a 
second party and a foriegner who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to 
the Bank, and also present a foreign account where 
he will need the money to be re-transferred into on 
his request as it may be after due verification and 
clarification by the correspondent branch of the 
bank where the whole money will be remitted from to 
your own designated bank account. 


I will not fail to inform you that this transaction 
is 100% risk free.On smooth conclusion of this 
transaction, You will be entitled to 25% of the total 
sum as gratification,while 5% will be set aside to 
take care of expenses that may arise during the time 
of transfer, while 70% will be for me and my investment purposes which you will also assist me. 


Please, you have been adviced to keep this as top 
secret as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service, after concluding this deal 
with you.I will be monitoring the whole situation 
here in this bank until you confirm the money in 
your account, and ask me to come down to your 
country for subsequent sharing of the fund according 
to percentages previously indicated and further 
investment. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. 

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible, 
Stating your wish in this transaction. 

Yours faithfully, 

Mr Alfred Dadah 
(+228902-6091)
