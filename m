This C|Net news article says the SCO Group claims to have found many instances
of copyrighted UnixWare source code being inserted verbatim into the Linux
kernel:

	http://msnbc-cnet.com.com/2100-1016_3-999371.html

I can see a Linux developer copying copy from one of BSDs (which is cool), but
UnixWare?!?  Come on.

If there's UnixWare source in the Linux kernel, a SCO Group employee put it
there!  After all, who else would have such easy access to UnixWare sources?

If a SCO Group employee put the UnixWare source code into Linux, that begs the
question:

	Did the SCO Group conspire to plant copyrighted code in the Linux
	kernel so they could sue IBM for US$1 billion?

I believe the Justice Department calls that fraud, and that's a crime that CEOs
go to jail for.  Are you listening Darl McBride?
