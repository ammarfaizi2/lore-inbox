In the US, you cannot be made complicit by such an instrument.  If you sign
an NDA, and your boss murders someone and this murder is, strictly speaking,
covered by the NDA, you're still guilty of being an accessory if you don't
report it.  It's one of those little annoying differences between civil and
criminal law...

seriousness.

You can not talk about what you see or hear.

What is not clear?
