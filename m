Dear Sir/Madam,

I represent GLOBAL IMPORT/EXPORT COMPANY based in the UK. My company exports 
cocoa and other goods/services for world trade. What we really require is 
someone who can represent this company in Europe and America We have been 
having problems with clients in these regions because they are politely 
refusing to pay for shipments on one excuse or the other so we need a 
representative that can assist us in clearing our money in their respective 
countries.

Most of our customers pay out in cheques and we do not have an account in 
your country that will clear this money.


It is upon this note that we seek your assistance as our representative in 
your country.


Be informed that as our representative, you will receive 10% of whatever 
amount you clear for the company and the balance will be paid into an 
account we will avail to you. The second thing required of you would be for 
you to establish a relationship on behalf of our company with other cocoa 
industries in your country so that we can have new ideas and directions.

This job is rather easy and does not require a lot of expertise.

If you are interested in this business offer, please email me on this email 
address below:
(jg_jamesgrisham@walla.com)

Very Respectfully,


Mr. James Grisham,
President,
GLOBAL Import/Export co.
Goods for Import/Export
Freight Fwdg. Svcs.
