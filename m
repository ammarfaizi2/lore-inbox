What someone does in the privacy of his home is outside the scope of the 
GPL, this means the kernel repository is the private toy of Linus and he 
leaves the decision who may play with him to Larry.
This is also means that Linux history recorded in bk is not part of the 
public record. This is an unfortunate fact and not a complaint BTW, but 
Larry has not much use for facts anyway, when I try to summarize the facts 
around the publicly available information as best as I can, Larry doesn't 
even try to prove me wrong and instead continues to attack me personally. 
I don't really care about the latter, but that he gets the support to do 
so is the personally very disappointing part. :-(

bye, Roman
