I'm currently putting together (ordering parts for) another machine. It
will be a AMD64 X2. Now I'm looking into a video card for this.  Up till
now, I've always used NVidia.  But I also want to test 3D acceleration
under Ingo's -rt patch.  So now I need something that does not have a
priority module.

I'm not much of a gamer, although I do play every so often. So I don't
need the highest quality card, but I also want something that is still
pretty good. For example, I currently have a NVidia GeForce 6800 GT
card.  So I'm hoping to get something equivalent. 

I'm looking at the ATI Radeons.

Any recommendations? (links to info would also be nice ;-)

Thanks,

-- Steve
