In a lot of cases (like O_DIRECT) its cleaner to simply break the API
in a way that will spew warnings if people miss changes than mess around
with extra methods that instead break drivers that forgot to use C99
initializers.

I plan to carry on breaking the kernel internal API when I have to
and its easy to fix up the few affected users. I broke all the audio
drivers between 2.4.21->22 but that was worth doing for example.
