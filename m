Hmmm... Like I once told you, I felt like you were trying to sell me
your car, but you seem to have maintained it in very good state so I
am confident it will not break after a few miles. I still hope that
if I have any problem with it, you will come with your breakdown
truck to rescue me :-)

I hope I will get criticisms if I do things wrong. It's frustrating
to work without feedback (either positive or negative).

Best regards,
Willy
