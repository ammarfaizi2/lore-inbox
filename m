Subject: [PATCH 5/11] Entropy fixes - untrusted sources
Message-ID: <20020911051809.GT31597@waste.org>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.3.28i
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This makes irq and blkdev interrupts untrusted and does away with
their superfluous state initialization and tracking.
