though probably not always that enlightning as announced, I certainly would 
not consider those artices 'off topic'. - i fact, despite i don't understand 
a word of those silly idiomatic texts, sometimes, i found the latest one 
quite interesting and, tightly reated to 'assembly' . any attempt to trying 
to documenting on the rsp. cpu should be regarded "on-topic", what else...!

and, no #reader# (as opposed to some until now un-known, sort of 'maintainer')  
seems to have felt offended so there is no reason to that rude admonition.
for instance, i would find those overly repeated, stupid questions about some 
obscure 'real mode' in linux (or for access to #the# graphic memory) much 
more annoying and accordinly "off topic" - if i would, at all.

or, were you trying to cut down a bit on the tremendous traffic in this group?
what a great relief...

thanks + regards,

	hp
