Hi,

I am working on rebuilding a modified kernel. This is for version 2.2.18 and
on Slackware distro.

I have been looking for the command "sysctl" in my */sbin directories and I
can't seem to find it. Is this something that is an independent program that is
compiled during the kernel build? I do see a few SYSCTL options in the the
xconfig session. Is this command distro specific?

Thanks for any info or pointers.
