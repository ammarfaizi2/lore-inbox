this is the mysql/sap db way of making money, btw. You publish libs which
are needed to ship with your product under the "free" GPL, and sell a
commercial license for all others. This does work good, as long as you do
not accept major contributions which are not reassigned to your copyright.

Sorry for the OT but I guess the whole thread is :(
