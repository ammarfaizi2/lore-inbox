A bit of a historical note is in order.  Jeff used to work for Novell... 
And had more than a small dispute with them over some linux code he did 
that allowed linux to, as I recall, do things with netware 4.x.  Novell 
took exception as at the time the only other code that did it was closed 
source distributed through Caldera.
