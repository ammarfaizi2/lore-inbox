Nope.
It means within 30 days of you giving them notice, they'll give you a 
license to do whatever you want with your stuff in terms of *use*. They 
aren't giving you back *ownership*.
It's not a copyright transfer, it's a license.   It gives you much the 
same rights, but you don't get the legal protection remedies and 
whatnot that are in the copyright statute.
They'd have to reassign copyright back to you to get it.
Copyright transfers must be explicit, and in writing (mumble mumble as 
with all of law, there are a few small exceptions mumble mumble).
So if it doesn't look like a copyright assignment, and you can't tell 
if it is one or not, it's not one.
