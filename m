I don't give two hoots about the money or the open/closed stuff in the
context of "Is it the right thing to do?" or "What should nvidia do?"
nvidia's drivers have developed a bad reputation, at least in my mind,
and I don't want their bugreports (even though RH was hurt worst here),
and I don't want my betatesters adding that unknown into the equation.

Supposedly they've improved lately, not that I care. One only need be
bitten once.

Maybe having no way to prove a bug's fixed is a downside of binary modules.
