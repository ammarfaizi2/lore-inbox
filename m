Andrew, 
please listen to me ,
I think 
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_ENABLE(PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_ANY_ID, quirk_via_irq)
is wright if interrupts are in XT-PIC mode, If we disable APIC or/and
Local APIC, yes we have to quirk the VIA PCI interrupts, ok ?

if not, if we have IO-APIC enabled (with ACPI I guess, ACPI knows make
IRQ routings ), we don't need neither should quirks the VIA PCIs.
This is my opinion base on some emails from Alan Cox , Bjorn Helgas
etc.. and for now is the best shot we have.


Thanks,
