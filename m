Hi Ivan, All

First, sorry for the cross posting...

After long sessions of patching, recompiling, and testing I finally
found the cause of my problems. XFS people, please read:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108047692409817&w=2
and
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107910319729364&w=2

After reverting 1.1608.29.12 all is fine again.
Interestingly, this patch was listed on bkbits between 2.6.3
and 2.6.4-rc1 but was added to the source tree between 2.6.4-rc1 and
2.6.4-rc2 :-( Again something learned for the future...

Ivan, I think your new semaphore code is still ok because it doesn't
matter if it is the new or old code. Both versions have a problem with
the xfs-patch.

For further questions you know how to reach me:-)

greets

Marc
