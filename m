Subject: Problems with sound in 2.4.x (.7 and .8 definitely) with CS4248

Whether it be MP3, OGG, or whatever, I cannot play sound
without getting the following message in 2.4.7 and 2.4.8 (I
don't believe I tried any other versions).  However, I
believe it works (unless hardware failure has happened in
the past 6 mos) in 2.2.x.

Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?

My hardware is a CTX EzBook 800 series laptop with a Mobile
AMD 300 MHZ K6-2 with 128 Meg of memory (EDO I believe). 
The CS device is built in.

Sorry that I cannot provide much more at the moment.  This
problem does happen with 80%+ of memory free and nearly
nothing in swap.

My heat sink goop has dried out and I will be replacing that
in about 4 days, however, I am not sure this is the problem.

Any questions I will answer... so please don't ignore me
because I didn't have too much I could offer, but with help
I can answer.

Trever
