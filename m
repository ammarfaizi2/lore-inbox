I tried the 2.6.1-mm2 tree and changed the 84 to 43, but that doesnt
help my USB keyboard. Showkey does still show 84.

static unsigned short x86_keycodes[256] =
...
         80, 81, 82, 83, 43, 93, 86, 87, 88, 94, 95, 85,259,375,260, 90,
...

Maybe adbhid needs a similar tweak? I could not find the place, yet.
