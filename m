SCO moved to Linux a long time ago. This must be from some joke-troll.
The SCO-Unix just wouldn't hack it and before the Santa Cruz Operation
started to supply Linux to their customers, they were in serious trouble.
Caldera/SCO/LinuxWare -- they are all the same company now, are they
planning to sue their divisions???

This just doesn't make any sense and seems to be some garbage invented
by media-hypes, err types.
