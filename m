Hi !

I am looking for a gfx card to purchase for use with Linux.

Requirements :
 - working TV-out ( S-Video or composite-video ), I mean really working
   and supported in linux, not "it works if the BIOS initializes it and
   Linux doesn't touch it"
 - video support ( in HW and linux-SW ) is desired ( color space conversion,
   video overlays and stuff )
 - PCI interface ( I plan later to multihead with another AGP card and also
   want to keep the price low )
 - 3D acceleration welcome ( with XFree86 support ), but not that important
 - low price :-)

( message posted to linux-fbdev@vu.union.edu, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
  and to linuxconsole-dev@lists.sourceforge.net mail lists , please CC me
  the replies and excuse me if some of them are inappropriate  )
