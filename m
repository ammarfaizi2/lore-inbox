*Strong medication*. Very strong. Now with added eucalyptus! It'll make
removing all that code easier. Ya know, you don't like cdrom support in
your kernel (and claim it corrupts memory on your SuSE box...that's
cute) but I've never much like memory management or CPU support in my
kernel. I say you rip out everything under kernel/ and mm/ just in case.
After all, Novell operatives might have secretly corrupted it, eh? ;-).

I meant that too. Just think about it - with the number of contributors
in the kernel you'll have to offer a lot of money before even a few of
them start to hear cash register sounds in their head. I expect it is
graphable, but I've never actually that eye-rolling-dollar-sign thing
that happens in the various cartoons. By the time it's diluted down, is
the guy entitled to 0.05 cents really going to be suddenly convinced
that all this time he was secretly after money but didn't realize it?

| Not for a license to a single snapshot of a single 2.6.X or 2.4.X
| version.

I'd argue that the kernel is entirely priceless. It's better than that,
more advanced, now extra-caffeinated with added pro-V complex!

| I agree this isn't about money.

...oh but you think this pointless endeavour of yours will actually get
you somewhere other than in even more killfiles. I really shouldn't feed
the troll but it's oh so hard to resist. I mean, you seem like a fun
crazy sort of guy. So far I've seen:

~    *). Intense bitterness at Novell.
~    *). Signs of paranoid delusion.
~    *). A fundamental missunderstanding of the GPL.
~    *). Various other random craziness.

Tell me, Mr Jeff, of various mail domains (does that make you feel
bigger and better than the rest of us?) are you funded by Microsoft to
suggest this stuff or do you truly believe it? Really? Truly? I mean,
I'd much rather hear you're being paid to say this shite.

| It's about control and using the GPL to control what happens.

...by undermininging it and opening the floor to bribary. What would
those damn Novell snipers say about that?

| The offer is for real.

I doubt that greatly. Actually no, I don't. I believe there are crazy
people in the US with lots of money who'll think this is a good idea.

Jon.
