Hello.

In the recent kernel 2.4 I can't find the module rtl8139.o.
And I chose <M> on the realtek part in menuconfig.
I need that driver for my networkcard that is a little old and there
isn't any other drives for it I think. 
In 2.2.* it could be found but not in 2.4.* so maybe you've change name on
that module or sth?
Please help me.

/Jeck.
