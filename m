Well, actually I am not sure whether it says it. Unfortunately I don't
know the English terms. As far as I have understood it: This was just a
"quick" decision making, a "real" court case comes later. So far the
court finds it reasonable to enforce the cease and desist letter until
the final decision comes, as the "probability" is high, that the GPL is
compatible with German laws and even if not, the company wouldn't be
allowed to use the GPLed software.

bye,

Prakash
