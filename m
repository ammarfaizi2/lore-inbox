I wasn't talking about you.  They know who they are.

I think I have.  All the references to T10, all the pictures
to the email you replied to which you deleted, all the words.

Well, the T10.org reflector is open to everyone.

Of course voting-membership is expensive.  And it should be so.
They don't want every "Joe" (no offence to Joe or to LKML or LSML
participants) to participate.

If you are a voting member then you really have a reason, you really
know what you're talking about and voting for and you really are
serious. It means that you or your company care.
It also becoms quickly enough obvious if you know your stuff
after a meeting or two.
