Hello,
	Sorry for the somewhat off-topic post, but I was wondering if anyone 
from l-k will be at Supercomputing next month (www.sc2000.org)

If so, would anyone be interested in having a BoF session? I'd be
particularly interested in knowing if any of the people working on big
iron machines are going to be there, and would maybe be interested
in making a short presentation.

If there's any interest, please respond to me off the list. I'll drop one
more note to linux-kernel if anything becomes of it, but otherwise this
will be the last message I subject most of you to.

Thanks!

-Erik
