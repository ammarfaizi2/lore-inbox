The "Wrong map file" was reported because, based upon your command line,
it looks like readprofile used /usr/src/linux/System.map rather than the
System.map from your Xscale/ARM system.  If you have the map file for
your ARM kernel, you could try using the -m option when invoking
readprofile to specify a path to your ARM's System.map.

	./readprofile -m /specify/path/to/arm/System.map -p ./my_profile

That is possible.  Unfortunately, I don't have my StrongARM-based
handheld running a modern kernel, so I can't offer much help here.
