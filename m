Hello,

Please cc me as I am not on this mailling list.

I have been researching the 4g patches for kernels. 
Seems there was a rift between people over this.  Is
there any plan to resume publishing 4g patches for
developing kernels?

I am currently trying to get 4g to work with 2.6.6-mm5
but of course running into issues,so any help on this
would be great!

Thank you for your time.
Phy
