I have identical behaviour here, though not on the VAIO. This is a
no-name laptop that I got from QlTech, so I'm not completely sure what
the hardware is (I'll append below what information I can glean about
it).  I've been running 2.4.23 with the ck low-latency patches with no
problems (except that there is no power-down on shutdown). The
distribution is also Debian testing.

I've tried disabling ACPI with acpi=off, but that didn't help. 
I've also tried disabling ISAPNP in the kernel config, but that didn't
help either.
