That's extra overhead for scripts and such like which I'm unable to
ensure is safely implemented.  Sorry.

Look, I _am_ taking the easy way out of this by completely avoiding
the issue by eliminating or munging email addresses such that they
can't be read as such.  The alternative is that patches go into the
BK tree as "rmk@flint.arm.linux.org.uk" - but people don't like that
either.  So the munging is a compromise to keep people happy.

If people find that unacceptable, here's what those people can do:

 If someone wants me to change this, go find a UK solicitor who is an
 expert in this area and who is willing to provide his services in this
 area for free (hey, we're talking about my _personal_ activities here
 after all which are _completely_ unfunded) to answer questions in this
 area.  Alternatively, the people with a problem can fund such a solicitor.

Anything short of that are just random opinions and carry no weight
what so ever, and I will not change my activities in a way which I
personally believe will infringe UK law.

(PS, bkbits itself seems to munge email addresses.  Maybe someone
would like to complain to Larry about that?)
