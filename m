Hey Gang,

I need to find an updated or some good articles on how to tune the linux
kernel for a system that is using a 2-4G of memory, and a lot of memory
reads.  I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm not finding
any new relevant information on 2.4.x.

If anyone has any experience tuning the kernel could you please reply to
this email to my email address, as I am not subscribed to the list.

Thanks,

- John
