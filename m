Probably. I freely admit I didn't follow the whole discussion. But the
example quoted strongly hinted at fudging timers in case of DST, which
would be very bad if done systematically and not on explicit user request.

What I meant to write is "do not assume any random clock adjustement
should change timer duration". Some people want it, others definitely
don't.

I case of kernel code legal time should be pretty much irrelevant, so if
24h timers are adjusted so they still go of at the same legal hour, that
would be a bug IMHO.
