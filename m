'get stuck' is really some good wording here I have to say.

The point of most of the ones who angrily replied to your original post was,
I believe, that you're obviously not in a position to make remarks about the
quality of the new build system.

Sorry, but the opinion of someone who complains about having to switch to
"make install" instead of "make oldconfig dep clean bzImage modules" (the
new command even being much simpler for chrissakes) and admits that that's
the only problem they can see, isn't of much value here.

Just a side note:
Why exactly are you upgrading your kernel every time a new release is out,
when you don't have a need to do so? I honestly doubt you're waiting for
a particular fix.

Man, no offense meant here, but has it ever occurred to you that the clock won't ever
stop and one has to keep learning new things every day? From what you have written
it seems you can be in serious trouble each time your favorite grocery store closes
down and you have to go round one more corner to get your bread and butter.
