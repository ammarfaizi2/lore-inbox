hi 
im looking for some documentation about the scsi subsystem in 
kernel 2.4. i found some realy incomplete documentations about
the old one and some words about differences between the old
one and the new one. but that all dont help. i'm looking for docs
that describe the the internals since i'm planing to write a scsi 
driver for a NIC.

thanks for any hints
