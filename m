I have a matrox G550.  Not known for the best 3D performance,
but it is good enough for tuxracer which is my heaviest 3D app.
It is supposed to be good at 2D.

It should be fine for a non-gamer, one of the things matrox does well
is a nice sharp flicker-free picture.  (A feature that don't require
any os support either!)  The picture is certainly better than the
radeon I use at work, that one has some flickering in high-frequency
images such as the default X background.
