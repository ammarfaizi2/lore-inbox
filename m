FWIW, Red Hat ships the CIPE kernel module (VPN), so the US export issues
have already been looked at by them.

The US regulations can be found at:

The Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for the kernel IMHO would
be "NLR" (No License Required) because of the license exception for source
code found in ยง740.1(e)(2).
