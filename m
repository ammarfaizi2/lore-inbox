Hello, good work with 2.4.x, but I miss one thing. in early 2.3.x the MS 
keys, you know, two flags and one "properties" key worked as navigation 
keys in the console.

The flags get you to the "left" or "rigth" virtual console, and the 
"properties" key put you on the last console you where before.

This was very useful when working in the console, I use the console 
sometimes, and I miss these feature.

Is there a plan to put back these keys to work, or there was a problem 
of some kind and this feature got dropped?
