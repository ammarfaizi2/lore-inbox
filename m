Subject: ide-cd still borken for me in 2.5.45

I have been building my system to use ide-scsi for ages now because of 
reqiurements for cdrecord.  With the announced intention to get rid of 
ide-scsi in 2.5.44 I have started trying ide-cd with no success.  I 
previously reported this problem for 2.5.44 and 2.5.45 continues the 
issue.  My system is based on RedHat 7.3, with an A7V133 motherboard and 
an Athlon 1.3GHz processor.  

Building ide-cd monolithic (or modular and attempting a modprobe) gives me 
endless streams of the following error messages (hand-copied from 
console):

hdc: irq timeout: status=0x90 {Busy}
hdc: irq timeout: error=0x01IllegalLengthIndication
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset timed-out, status=0x80
ide1: reset: success
