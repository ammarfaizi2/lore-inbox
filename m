Hmm interesting, that Microsoft has no 800dpi mouse.  Glad I picked Logitech 
then.  I assumed they were equivalent resolution since most reviews give the 
Intellimouse the nod, but I don't know how the heck a 400dpi can compete 
with a 800dpi.

Running the Logitech @ 800 on a black surface, it's flawless.  I just can't 
get it to fail a twitch test, despite having fewer pictures per second.  I 
did notice it doing a little pixel dance one time on a blue pad, but it's 
not ever done that with my black vinyl surface.
