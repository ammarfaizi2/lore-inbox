If you decide to use it as such, yes. I have actually done such in the past, 
since I needed to find some use for the box once the media was removed.

And anyway, you did state, as pointed out by someone else, that "smake may be 
used as a Makefile validator" Since you advertise such a fact - that it works 
as a Makefile validator - does that not make it such?

I realize you'll just deny it and don't know why I bother even looking in the 
folder your mails get sorted into. Maybe I just have a masochistic streak...
