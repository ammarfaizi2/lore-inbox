I have one such built in in my Dell Inspiron 8200, which is why 
I'm following this thread with particular interest.

The strange thing is that under Windows the modem is configured 
as a Conexant thingie ... or is the problem that I have both 
and the Conexant thingie is the one connected to the actual 
modem plug? Is there a way to know this (other than having a 
look inside my laptop, that is)?
