Read the GPL :)  The source code "preferred form" is clearly not an
on-disk kernel tree with no information about the changes [patches]
that were processed in a specific sequence, to produce that end result.

Anyway, I would rather the thread die, since it is clear that they are
_not_ in violation of the GPL, and the source code is available.  :)
