Eh, come on Larry.  You're too smart for this crap (as are others, your 
straw just broke the camel's back).  Linus was just using an analogy to 
illustrate some very valid points.  All analogies break down when 
applied to the nth degree.  Insulting Linus because you've found a spot 
where the analogy breaks is just ludicrous.
