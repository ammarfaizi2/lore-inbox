Would everyone that complains about 11Kb (4683 bytes bzip2 compressed)
when downloading 144Mb (26Mb bzip2 compressed) please stand up, and leave
the room.

Seriously, you're trolling.

BTW: why no rightous indignation about the "Hideous Commercial Pitch" in
fs/reiserfs/README?  Code in that directory is dual licensed under the
GPL and a strictly commercial license, similar to BK, and is actually
_included_ with the kernel, as opposed to BK which is merely useful with
the kernel.
