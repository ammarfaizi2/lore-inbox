I do recognize the surprise this urgent but confidential letter will bring to you especially as it came from a stranger, but rest assured that it came with the best of intentions. I am Mrs. Catherine Apepe, from the Diamond-rich district of Sierra Leone and my late husband was the former Special adviser to the ousted Head of State of Sierra Leone, Major Johnny Paul Koroma. I got your email address from a friend who works at the International Chamber of Commerce here in South Africa.

During the war between our forces led by the Ex-Head of State, Major Johnny Paul Koroma and the West African Allied Forces (ECOMOG), my country relied heavily on the foreign earnings generated from diamond trade. This money was personally kept by the then President Major Johnny Paul Koroma since our banking system had collapsed during the war. However, as the war progressed, it became apparent that we were going to loose the war to the superior and better armed West African Allied Forces (ECOMOG). At this point, my Husband Mr. Luis Apepe starched away the sum US$30,000,000.00 in a security and storage company here in South Africa for safekeeping and to avoid being traced. Unfortunately on his return to Sierra Leone he was murdered.

Right now my son and I are in South Africa to claim this money and we need a trustworthy individual or company that can help us proved the important instruments that we will need in transferring and receiving the fund abroad for purpose of investment as South Africa is not conducive for us to invest this fund as we are presently refugees, if you are willing to assist we will offer you 30% of the total sum.

God bless you as we wait for your immediate response, please do include your telephone number, you can also call me or my son or email me,
 mrapepe@walla.com Mr. Peter Apepe on +27 724340319  

Regards,

Mrs. Catherine. Apepe
