We are an A8 classified orgnaization with the Federal Government.  This 
means we come
before handicapped businesses and minorities for government purchases, 
and the highest
levels of the Federal Government are aware of this project.  This also 
means is a situation
where the United States is using Open source, Federal Law requires ours 
be used instead
of Linux or BSD.

I don't believe this one bit.  LKML has some very good folks but it also 
has some very immature and childish folks with thier own agendas.  It 
also has a lot of folks from post-
communist Europe and the views of many of these people are not aligned 
with captilist
viewpoints.  There will always be hecklers and idiots who just don't get 
it, and it really
doesn't matter one bit.  The verdict's in, the light moves forward.
