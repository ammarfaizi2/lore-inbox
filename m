Hi,

When you'll have to connect through a NAT wall to a server, you'll be damn 
ot of luck. And the possibility to achieve something in a weird way 
through a ten thousand of backdoors does not justify the dismissal of a 
cool technology that would make it just too easy to handle. Not to 
mention IPv4 is far too dangerous. I've had to write heaps of reports 
saying that you can spoof a personality using IPv4 security holes, just 
because some person was under accusation of things he's never done. 
Remember Rubin Carter, 1976?

I'm getting through with bind9 pretty well, actually.

Well, one can argue about the advantages of extended technology, but as 
long as they can save lifes (philosophically speaking), no way to argue 
with me. I'd never let people get arrested because I don't have ganas to 
introduce newer technologies! Do you understand my point?
