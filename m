My opinions only!!

With CVS, probably -- it's open source and rather universally known.
With the version control *process* ... well ... I personally favor a
full SEI CMM level 2 or even level 3 process. Whether there are open
source tools to facilitate that process is another story.

There is, as it turns out, a tremendous *amount* of documentation,
although it is not as centralized as it could be. Again, I favor the SEI
CMM model.

Absolutely! Bug tracking and source / version control ought to be
integrated and centralized.

Well ... peer review / code walkthroughs are part of SEI CMM level 3
IIRC, and peer review is an important part of the scientific process. We
all have our opinions and our reasons for being here and levels of
contribution we are willing and able to make. When all is said and done,
more is said than done :)). A lot *is* getting done! The only things I
would change about this list are a reliable digest, a *vastly* better
search engine and a better mailing list manager than majordomo.
