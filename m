Whoohoo!  Here we go.  Someone please rattle his cage about the BK license
and we can keep this going for months!

This reminds me of soc.singles, a venerable hangout for weirdos of all
kinds, yours truly included years and years ago.  I once posted some
inflammatory statement and disappeared to Japan for several months
(installing a supercomputer at Tokyo Institute of Technology, look at
the acronymn, gotta love it), and then came back.   3 months later.
Read soc.singles.  They were *still* arguing about it.

Then and now, the thought that occurred was "get a life".
