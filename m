Obviously it would be in everyone's best interest to set a position of
live and let live.  Everyone assumes they are going to do the wrong thing,
and that shows how the general community is thinking how do I get my piece
of the pie.  I guess we have reached the level of BSD now.

Maybe people should give then the benefit of the doubt; othewise, where do
we start the forks we have already, but not officially labelled as such?

$DISTRO-linux

This is what the larger business interests are hoping for the lemmings to
run off the cliff.  If they (UBL) is successful in fragmenting the
community then that interested party(ies) will be able to morph
GPL->BSDish and the game is over.

$0.02 and keep the change!

If you are a (UBL) interest holder, up yours dude!
