This has been made clear to Eben and the FSF, for a long time.  The
FSF has simply chosen not to listen to Linus and other members of the
kernel community.  In fact, I've never seen any interest in a
dialogue, just a pseudo-dialogue where "input is solicited", and then
as near as far as I can tell, at least on the anti-Tivo issue, has
been simply ignored.  But in any case, it should not have come as a
surprise and should not have startled anyone.
