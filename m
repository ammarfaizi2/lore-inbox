The Pike patent from the USL acquisition is the one Microsoft most 
wanted to get their hands on, as well as the SMP
patents.  The Pike patent controls overlapping Windows.     M$ has 
wanted to get clear of it for some time.  With the
cross license from Novell, they are home free.  Novell has a large 
number of networking and directory patents. 

Not quite 1000, but they have some very good ones on SMP, clustering, 
and form the USL acquisition.
