I suggest taking this slowly; just like no one here would like a bunch
of lawyers breathing down their necks for something I'm sure their guys
won't either - and that should probably be a last resort after people
have tried a few friendlier contacts.

In the case of busybox I guess they are just using a standard unmodified
one; so in principal all they really missing is an acknowledgment
pointing to its home page.

In the case of the kernel do we know they've actually made any
modifications at all? Or is it just a standard distribution from
someone else?  Perhaps they've contributed changes back?
