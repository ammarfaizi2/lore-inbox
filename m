Sir

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me, since you do not know me personally. I 
am Matt Tobi   the son of  Mr. Simon Tobi who was recently murdered in the land dispute in 
Zimbabwe.

I got your contact through network on line in search for a reliable and reputable person to 
handle a very confidential matter which involves transfer of fund to a foreign account. 

My late father was among the few rich black zimbabwean  farmers murdered in cold blood 
by the agents of the ruling government of  president  Robert Mugabe, for his alleged 
support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean opposition party  controlled by the white minority.

Before my father's death, and like he had already foreseen the looming danger in 
Zimbabwe, had deposited the sum of Eight million five hundred thousand united state 
dollars (US$8.5 million) in a Trust and Finance company oversea till normacy return to 
Zimbabwe.This Fund was supposedly meant for purchases of new machinery and chemical 
products for Agro-allied farms and for the establishment of new farm in 
Lesotho. 

This  problems arose when President Robert Mugabe   introduced a new land  act  that  
wholly affected the rich white farmers  and some blacks vehemently condemned the 
"modus operandi" adopted by  the  government wich resulted to rampant killings and mob 
action by the war veterans and some political thugs. Precisely more than three thousands 
(3,000) people have so far been killed. Heads of  governments from the west, especially 
Britain and United states have voiced their condemnation of Mugabe's plans to no avail.  It 
is against this background that I, as the eldest son of my father, and having made some 
reasonable contact with the Trust company where the fund currenetly is, decided to seek a 
genuine foreign partner who can assist me in  transfering  this fund from the Trust company 
since I have all the documents that relates to the 
fund. 

I am now looking for somebody on whom I can entrust this fund, and help invest this fund in 
a risk free and profitable ventures.I am ready to offer you 20% of the fund, if you are ready 
to assist me. And I await your response to enable me give you the full details of the 
transaction.

Best Regards,

Matt Tobi
