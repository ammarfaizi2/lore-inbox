I can.  Two IDE drives from one of my machines:

    hda: Conner Peripherals 210MB - CP3201F, 203MB w/64kB Cache, CHS=684/16/38
    hdb: WDC AC2170M, 162MB w/32kB Cache, CHS=1010/6/55

The Western Digital drive was bought with the PC in January 1993 (486sx24
later upgraded to 486dx30), so has reached 9 years old.  The Conner is
a year or two younger.

The machine spent most of the time initially constantly on, had a idle
period for several years, and is now on full time again as a DNS server.
