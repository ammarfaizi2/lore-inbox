    Sure, but then if Linux cannot (for either legal men-with-guns reasons
    or technical reasons) utilize this content, you lose at the desktop. 

    And if Linux cannot serve this traffic, you lose at the server. 

    And then you lose the critical support many of the people working on
    it who need to do this stuff to make money. 

    If this becomes law, Linux in some fashion will support it. IBM and
    the like are (or will be) making too much money off it not to.
  
    And if the government tells you how or what to do with the contents
    of your computer, you will because if the financial interests are
    strong enough, the laws will get passed, the constitutions will get
    modified, and the courts will accept it. 

    And then you have two choices.

    Do what they tell you, or go to jail. (Well, there is a third
    choice, but it would best not be discussed here).
