The attached .config file created a working kernel
for 2.4.2.  Now, with the one compiled from 
2.4.5pre2aa1, it only gives kernel panic during boot
with the following message:

Kernel panic:  Attempted to kill the idel task
In idle task -- not syncing


This happened on LX164 with AlphaBIOS running
SuSE-7.0, gcc-2.95.2-136.  Almost identical .config
file created a working kernel for UP2000 SMP.
So, what is wrong with LX164?  Should I dump this old
ALpha now?

Andrea told us that he will not care for anything
compiled with gcc-2.95 or version lower than that.
However, it seems that this kernel panic has anything
to do with gcc-2.95.

Anyway, gcc-2.95 is still the official release of gcc.
Even SuSE-7.1 has this version only.  I wish SuSE puts
something higher than 2.95 in their web site somewhere.

Best regards,

Hugh
