LORINA LANGLOIS
ABIDJAN-IVORY COAST.
WEST AFRICA.

Dearest One,
Good a thing to write you. I have a proposal for you-this however is
not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against
your will.
I am Lorina Langlois, 22years old and the only daughter of my late parents

Mr. and Mrs. Langlois .My father was a highly reputable business magnet-(acocoa
merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his
days.
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during
one of his business trips abroad on the 12th.Febuary 2000.Though his sudden
death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an
uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the
truth!
My mother died when I was just 8 years old, and since then my father
took me so special. Before his death on February 12th., 2000 he called his

Secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he
has the sum of two Two-million Four-Hundred-Thousand United State
Dollars (USD$2.400,000) left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading
banks in Africa.

He further told me that he deposited the money in his name, and
finally issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in
possession of all the necessary but legal documents to this fund and the
bank.
I am a university undergraduate and I really don't know what to
do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. This
is because I have suffered a lot of set-backs as a result of incessant
political crisis here in COTE D'IVOIRE, and the death of my father
actually brought sorrow to my life.
I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regard. Your
suggestions and ideas will be highly appreciated.

 Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
 1. Can you honestly help me as your son?
 2. Can I completely trust you?
 3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you
    after the money is in your account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

 Thank you so much.
 My sincere regards,

 Lorina Langlois.
