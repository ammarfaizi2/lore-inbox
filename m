Not watching Hollywood movies sure won't end my life. I can do without
them, and I'm sure eventually many other people will realize they can
too. I already know many that stopped going to movies when the price hit
$6.00 (it's $8.50 here now), and several that stopped buying and renting
them as well.

There are, after all, many more far more useful things in life. Hell, I
have 3 boxes of books I can read (or am I going to have to pay some
publisher somewhere every time I read one?! :) But, now this _IS_ OT. :)
