I just bought a Sony Vaio GRV550. So far I have not had any real
problems with it. There was an issue with sound in 2.4, but fixed in
2.5. Talking with some people, we came to the conclusion it was just a
bad merge, and no problem with the hardware being supported. The Radeon
card works great in X11, although has issues with the framebuffer in
2.5. PCMCIA works great, currently have 802.11b working. DVD/CD-RW drive
works great. Pretty much everything else is detected and supported,
although I have not tried to get the built in 56k modem working. The
screen is big (16.1"), and at 2.4ghz it is rough on battery (about an
hour and a half for a full batter).

Other than the frame buffer in 2.5 and sound in 2.4, it works great.

Matthew J. Fanto
