Hi everybody , and sorry for my english.

I am under debian sid and i have installed the kernel 2.424 . After few time i 
noticed that the new kernel-image on the debian apt tree was available. So i 
decidede to install it. (For the 2.4.24 i did with the kernel sources and 
make dep etc..) I have installed it then i reboot.
On the reboot i have a kernel panic due to a eip problem.
My mother board is a p4p800 and the kernel version i've installed is the 
2.6.2-smp. (i have a 2.6 ghz intel cpu with hyperthreading.) 

Have someone an idea? 

thanks a lot 

Manu
