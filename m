hi,

i would like to know if isn't it possible to implement a hot kernel
change, i mean, without reboot. i would do it myself if i had the knoledge
to do it but i'm starting with kernel-level programing now. i think it
would be possible if we make something like M$'s OS do when it hibernates,
copy all the memory, registers, etc to the disc and then put all back
again.

am i dreaming or this is possible? :)

Greetings,

Carlos "r3pek" Silva
