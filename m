Subject: Repeatable hard crash with 2.6.0.test[123]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have been experiencing hard system lockups with 2.6.0-test[123].
One application will reliably cause the system to crash when it exits
"normally".  If I attempt to kill the app with
    kill -9 pid
it does not crash, and exits correctly, but
    kill -HUP pid
will also cause the system crash.  This app worked fine and exited correctly
in all 2.5.[67]x kernels.  I also noted one system lockup when the app
was not involved, but this specific app will ALWAYS pull down the system.

The app is a java "jar" file that runs under X.  It is a complex app, but
in simplest form it just displays a menu with a "quit" button (and other
stuff).  If I immediately click the "quit" button, without doing anything
else with the app, it will crash the system.

This app is also available as a run-time downloadable java app for mozilla.
When run this way, under mozilla, it also causes the crash.

Once, I started the jar app in X, then switched to a console vt.  When I
did "kill -HUP" to the app, I got this output:

        (unknown output at beginning)
[<c01cb601>] exit_io_context+0x21/0x90
[<c011a717>] printk+0x107/0x140

[<c0115960>] do_page_fault+0x010/0x43e
[<c0109155>] error_code+0x2d/0x38
        (repeat about 1000 times)

Code: 8b 43 10 85 c0 74 07 8b 50 04 85 d2 75 29 89 1c 24 e8 69 ff
 <0> Kernel panic: fatal exception in interrupt
In interrupt handler - not syncing
        (machine dead now)

If anyone can suggest some additional tests, or maybe give me some patches,
I can help test and debug this problem;  So far I have not been able to
get any info from alt-sysrq or any kind of usable register dump....

ps=  My machine is Asus A7M266 mb with Athlon 1.2, running redhat 9 with just
the few changes needed to get the 2.[56] kernels running.  My 2.6.0-test3
.config file is attached....
