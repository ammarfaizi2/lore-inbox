I sometimes use it as a desktop. Thing is as I never took the time to
try to make work sw suspend, I'd rather have it running all the time
than to restart it every now and then.

While looking for a replacement disk, I've seen that some new disks
were "designed for continuous, 24/7 operation".

E.g. http://www6.tomshardware.com/storage/20030813/mini-harddisks-01.html

Not sure how good that is, but I will sure look into it...

Thanks for all who answered. If you want to further the talk, it maybe
better to take this off lkml now.
