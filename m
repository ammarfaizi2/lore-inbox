The GPL gives me the right to distribute modified versions _only if I
comply with the GPL_. And GPL forbids further restrictions when
distributing.

If your bizarre interpretation was right, no software licence at all would
have any validity. In particular, I'd be more than very surprised if the
GPL was so sloppily written. It was written with the input of eminent
lawyers, after all.
