I'm about to write a (IR) KEYBOARD device driver. I guess I'm better off
using the existing work on the USB-path with input core etc that appeared
sometimes around 2.2?

Is there ANY documentation/schematics on how this works or is it 'Read The
Fantastic Source' and/or e-mail Pavel Machek that is my way to go?

_Any_ pointers is of interest.
