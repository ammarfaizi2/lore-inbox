It's much smaller if you didn't know that it was at most 7 characters
long.  However, if you did know the upper bound, or you were just
brute forcing all passwords starting from 1 character, then the
difference is relatively minor.  This is because

n + n^2 + n^3 + n^4 + n^5 + n^6

is much smaller than n^7 where n is something like 62 for a reasonable
password.

So if your password was broken using this method, then it's probably
too short anyway.
