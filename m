Hello!
after a reboot, i have full access to a working sound config and no
problems whatsoever...

when the system has run several days, the sound disappears..... whilst
the devices all remain, thus the whole system sitll thinks sound is
working.....

i checked it out, sound is somewhat working, but to hear anything i
have to connect the system to a HIFI amp and push the amplification to
max, then i hear a faint sound corresponding to what i would expect to
hear....

i suspect the APM system to produce this....

i don't know what extra data i can send to make my problem appear
clearer.... there's nothing in the logs....

i am running a debian system with a 2.2.17 kernel...
and the OSS drivers

if anyopne has an idea..... its real cumbersome to have to reboot the
machine peridocally to reget working soundsupport
