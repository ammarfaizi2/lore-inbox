This is just a notice to everyone that Adrian is going to now be taking
over the 2.6.16-stable kernel branch, for him to maintain for as long as
he wants to.

He will still be following the same -stable rules that are documented in
the Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt file, but just doing this for
the 2.6.16 kernel tree for a much longer time than the current stable
team is willing to do (we have moved on to the 2.6.17 kernel now.)

So, if you have any patches that meet the -stable requirements for the
2.6.16 kernel, please send them to him, and not the stable@kernel.org
account, as we will just delete them.

And I'd like to offer my best wishes to Adrian for doing this work.
Personally I don't think it can be done for all that long of an amount
of time, and I will be very happy to see him prove me wrong :)

thanks,

greg k-h
