Well, certainly makes more sense when you consider how hard
it is to make ice at intellectual centers like Alexandria and Cordoba.
I suppose that if you lived in Iceland, then you'd have a ready
reference. ;-)

Ha.  The point is that it's easy to halve and quarter something while it's
much harder to one tenth something.

I don't recall that God ever made any special mention of three, but he
did mention seven.

My point is that HUMANS cannot accurately measure temperature, so it
makes more sense to use a fuzzier system.   Unless you are an android
with a 555 timer chip embedded in brain, you are a "fuzzy" thinker on
things which are continuous in nature.

But then again, I suppose that we should legislate exact frequencies
of light so that no one can make any mistake as concerns what is
yellow and what is lemon-chiffon.  And if your eyes are test and
are found to be out of spec, you'll be subjected to psychotherapy
sessions because you obviously have personnal issues which
are preventing you from seeing colour properly. ;-)

Look, just so that you all understand, I'm pro metrics.  I'm just
saying that they were not all totally crazy.   It's not like before
1790 all the people who had ever lived were morons.   Indeed,
after further reading, I found that Jefferson rejected the French
version of the Metric system because he though that their
measurements were not accurate enough (and less accurate
than many Greek and Egyptian mathematicians had made
millenia before.)
