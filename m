The GPL provides is a very _specific_ kind of freedom. It has its own
restrictions -- in many ways it's less free than if we were to just
release our code to the public domain, or under a BSD-style licence.

That is intentional.

Again, that is intentional. People are free to go use BSD if the GPL is
not compatible with their desires. Or Windows, perhaps.

People seem to be whining that Linux is released under the GPL instead
of a BSD licence. Perhaps the users concerned should be gently
encouraged to go elsewhere?

Linus was _joking_ when he said 'world domination'.
