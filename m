I'd be willing to bet, that since bathing in creosote is extremely
unhealthy, the courts might well find that that restriction was
nonsense.  This being the case they might decide that taken as a whole
the license was a fraud and grant the public the right to unrestricted
use of the product in question.  Especially if the defendants lawyer was
particularly good.
