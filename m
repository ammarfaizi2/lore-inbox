What is the 2.4 kernel that works best for SPARC?

The machine is a SPARC Ultra 10 3D creator with RedHat 6.2, now running some
old 2.4 kernel (cannot check right now).

I would also like to test some low-latency stuff if possible, and it is very
important that rebooting/powering off works 100% as it's an remote machine.
