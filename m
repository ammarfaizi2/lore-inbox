And they're the same. Novell acquired it from DR around the time it
was famously killed in the marketplace by Win3.1 compatibility
bogosity and Win95 bundling of DOS. Then they sold it to Noorda's
Caldera, who used it in their famous antitrust suit against Microsoft.
By this time it was already positioned as an embedded MS-DOS
replacement as Microsoft had EOLed its DOS offerings and there wasn't
any use for desktop DOS at that point.
