your analogy is false because in the case of the bitkeeper documentation
it explains an alternate which accomplishes something the same as
SubmittingPatches (some would say more, i.e. changelogs).  however Windows
does not accomplish the same as Linux.  for example, i can't run windows
on ARM (i take it from your mail address that ARM is of interest to you).
