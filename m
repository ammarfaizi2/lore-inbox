Subject: What is 2.4 Linux networking performance like compared to BSD?

I have a client that wants to implement a webcache, but is very leery of
implementing it on Linux rather than BSD.

They know that iMimic's polymix performance on Linux 2.2.* is half what it is on
BSD.  Has the Linux 2.4 networking code caught up to BSD?

Can I tell them not to worry about the Linux networking code strangling their
webcache product's performance, or not?

Hans
