This is why I have less and less intrest in listening to most of the
people who are around here.

They are either technically uninformed, personal offensive or obviously
not interested in a solution.

Well, once the people here express real interest, things may change.

As for now, it looks like I may make the following conclusions:

-	Linux was helpful and interesting between 1996 and ~ 2001

When looking at the current discussion, it seems to me that most people
here are still not interested in a fix.
