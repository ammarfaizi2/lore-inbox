Hi all,

The kernel I have working is version 2.4.21-4.EL and I
can still boot up to that. I compiled a 2.6.0 version
and installed it in exactly the same way that the old
version is, just appending 2.6.0 to the end of the
file. so when I reboot I get a boot screen that shows:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS (2.4.21-4.ELsmp)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux As-up (2.4.21-4.EL)
Red Hat linux (2.6.0)

Enterprise linux still boots up fine but when I try
and boot up Red Hat linux (2.6.0) I get some ouput and
then a kernel panic with this message:

<snip>
Software Suspend has malfunctioning SMP support.
Disabled :(
ACPI: (supports S0 S1 S4 S5)
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
RAMDISK: incomplete write (-1 !=32768) 4194304
VFS cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or unknown block
(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(0,0)

I am running Linux Enterprise Edition version 3.0 on
my server. It has 2 Xeon processors and 1 U360 scsi
HD. The whole reason behind my compiling a kernel is
trying to get support for high memory (this 
machine has 4 gigs of ram) and multi-processor
support.

I'm pretty sure I selected all scsi and driver support
because when i run the same kernel with RedHat Linux
9.0 in same machine it works fine. Everything is
compiled in and not as modules.

This is snip of my grub.conf file:
# grub.conf generated by anaconda
#
default=0
timeout=10
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm
title RedHat Enterprise Linux AS (2.4.21-4.ELsmp)
	root (hd0,0)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.21-4.EL ro root=LABEL=/
	initrd /initrd-2.4.21-4.EL.img
title RedHat Linux (2.6.0)
	root (hd0,0)
	kernel /linux-2.6.0 ro root=LABEL=/
	initrd /initrd-2.6.0.img

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in
advance,

Neel
