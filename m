Hello List,

Since I don't know who the admin is (I thought Larry?) of vger.kernel.org, I'm 
sending this mail here.

Since yesterday eve, 19PM GMT+2, I stopped receiving emails from linux-kernel. 
Today, I investigated on the issue, and found (using mxverify) out that 
vger.kernel.org has been listed in the blacklist of spamcop.

http://www.spamcop.net/w3m?action=blcheck&ip=67.72.78.212

Unfortunately, all the email addresses I have are 'spamcopped' by the 
respective ISP's.

Can action be undertaken by the admin so that all the world can once again 
have the full gory^Wglory of LKML (and the other mailling lists @ vger)?

Thanks,

Jan
