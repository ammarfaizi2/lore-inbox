Complete with "Patches only against 2.4.17 through 2.4.19", "Doesn't
compile con ARM with CONFIG_FOO", "Works fine on AXP"?

Looks like a _HUGE_ ammount of work...

Again, as was discussed here: PLEASE do save the complete message. Oh, BTW
the following thread might have caveats, fixes, and important comments.
