Long long ago, before Red Hat or any other distributions, people installed
Linux using a pair of floppies called the boot disk and the root disk.  This
was how I first installed Linux, using the 0.11 or 0.12 kernel.  It was
pretty easy to install a minimal self hosting Linux system using these disks.
If you can find someone with a set of these disk images for 0.11 and the
associated gcc disks, you can probably get a very early linux system up
fairly quickly.  I dont know who might have a set laying around, but I
hope this mail generates some comments from people who do.

Thanks,

Jim
