  Hello,

  I'm getting an oops when I try to connect my Zaurus (SL5500). When booting,
hotplug brings up usb without problems:

  However, when I insert Zaurus into the bay...

  The kernel survived, though (I'm writing this mail on it yet, at least :).
After removing Zaurus from the bay, it normally emitted

Aug 31 13:50:04 machine kernel: usb 2-2: USB disconnect, address 2

  but it ignores any further events generated by Zaurus - it does not react to
further inserts or removals (I have no other USB device available).

  I'm using:

Linux machine 2.6.0-test4-mm4 #1 Sun Aug 31 12:25:56 CEST 2003 i586 unknown

  The USB controller is:

  Bus  0, device   7, function  2:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies, In USB (rev 14).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      I/O at 0xd400 [0xd41f].
  Bus  0, device   7, function  3:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies, In USB (#2) (rev 14).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.
      I/O at 0xd800 [0xd81f].

  (I've chipset VIA82C686 Apollo (it's a crap ;).)
