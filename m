Won't work. MS would immediately report the true amount of new code in the
protected stuff includes 90% of the code in the old stuff, and therefore still
protected. The 10% of unprotected stuff would be the interfaceing code already
released (system calls, include files, library calls ...) plus a few drivers
for hardware no longer available. And removed comments...
