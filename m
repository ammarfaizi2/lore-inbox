I almost guarantee you that they get word docs in email.  And I bet you 
that most of them have been hit by the microsoft scripting viruses. 
 Even if they don't use outlook, they still get hit by the mails of 
those who do.

It kind of is the fault of MS.  That is why they have so many marketing 
people.  Remember the DR-DOS thing where you'd get misinforming errors 
if you didn't run MS-DOS, inmplying that anything but was inferior and 
was gonna cause you all kinds of hell?

Of course, if you knew anything about it, you knew that it was bullshit. 
 But you expect the entire world of non-computer people to know this??? 
 What kind of crack are you smoking?

It also isn't "your own free will".  Remember the licensing agreements 
where the royalties paid to Microsoft were based on the number of 
computer systems sold whether or not they had windows on them?  So if 
you bought a computer system (95% of the end users out there buy them 
pre-built) you paid for windows whether you used it or not.  And if you 
wanted something else you paid for TWO operating systems.  Even now, it 
is quite a challenge to purchase a computer system without buying a copy 
of windows.

The point is,  . . . that money came from somewhere . . . . .
