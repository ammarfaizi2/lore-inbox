VMware, an EMC company, is headquartered in Palo Alto, California.  VMware is
virtualization software that allows you to run multiple operating systems at
the same time. VMware software is used throughout the enterprise -- from the
desktop to the data center -- to minimize total cost of ownership of
computing infrastructure by maximizing its manageability, flexibility, and
efficiency. By running services in virtual machines spread across one or more
PCs, VMware software helps businesses save money while gaining greater
flexibility and control over their computing resources.
