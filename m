Given that using recent firmware and drive software works and stock
doesn't, I personally have a hard time saying that the configuration is
wrong. Being old-fashioned I conclude that the thing you change to fix a
problem is most likely the thing that caused the problem in the first
place.

can't speak to the 2100, I have a 2200, and with the current firmware and 
driver it works.

While an unsigned integer can never be negative, it can be less than zero 
for sufficiently large values of zero.
