Subject: What patch to get stable IDE in 2.5?

A while ago a few people posted a few different patches that purported 
to patch a stable 2.4 IDE system into the 2.5 code tree...but as I 
recall other people pointed out problems in those patches.

Is there a consensus on how to get a stable IDE subsystem in the 2.5 
series kernel?

thanks

eric
