Hi, I have P4 1,4 running on Garibaldi Intel board. Can compile and boot
the 2.4.7 kernel without problems (writing this message from the 2.4.7
kernel). However, when trying to boot the 2.4.10 or 2.4.12 kernel, it
hangs directly as booting starts.  The same hard drive transferred to an
AMD athlon 1GHz boots up perfectly, even though the kernel is compiled
for Intel P4!

Please can someone help me, I need to get 2.4.10 or 2.4.12 running asap!

Thanks.
