You sound about as pissed off as you do in a random thread about
somebody who violates the GPL, only now you're on the other side
of the fence.

If you don't like the new bitkeeper license, don't use bitkeeper.

If you feel _really_ strongly about it, help the subversion people
to build something as good as, or better than, bitkeeper so you
can convince kernel hackers to switch.

Rik
