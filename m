Dear sir,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday. My name is IDRIS UMAR a merchant in
Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has
defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a
few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly
lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even
myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was
always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the
only thing I cared for.

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than
just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when
God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a
different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have
willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and
extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to
give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money
which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them.
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of
eighteen million dollars $18,000,000,00 that I have with a
finance/Security
Company abroad.

I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.


I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.

God be with you. IDRIS UMAR.

N.B
PLEASE I WILL APPRECIATE THAT YOU REPLY THROUGH MY PRIVATE EMAIL
