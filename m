Hey! Don't forget UKC ;-) Cut my teeth on pdp11 v6 and VAXen BSD 4.1 once I got
away from the dreaded EMAS. Edinbugh Multi-Access System was the pitts.

Great days.  The business was so incestuous.  We seemed to swap engineers on a
regular basis.  Hacking drivers without kernel source and documentation that
always seemed at least a release behind.  Still keep a WY60 manual on my book

And the trouble we had explaining to customers that they had to buy a separate
SCO TCP/IP networking package just to hook up the IOLAN.
