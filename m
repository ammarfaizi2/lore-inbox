Except for some corner cases, ALSA is capable of emulating the 
in-kernel OSS.

And considering the low number of applications that are still OSS-only, 
I doubt it's really that important improving the OSS emulation even 
further.

But this is open source software, so feel free to send patches.

This is not how open source software works.

If you think something is missing, you have to implement it.

If you spend your "very little free time" on such discussions instead, 
you are not only wasting the time you could spend on implementing what 
you are thinking of but also the limited time of other developers.
