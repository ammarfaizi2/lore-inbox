This one did not mount root.  I got:

Can't open root dev "831" or unknown block(8,49)
Please append a correct root= boot option
unable to mount root fs from block(8,49)



Now 2.6.14 works with exactlï¿½y the same lilo.con,
where I have root=/dev/sdd1  (SATA drive)

The only changes from the 2.6.14 .config were a different
framebuffer font for the console (which worked fine) and
a change from voluntary preempt to fully preemptible in the
hope of running flash games and niced compiles together.
