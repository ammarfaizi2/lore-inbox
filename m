   No.   If you look carefully, you would be surprised at how many are
   using OutlookSExpress to handle their email.

   Of course in case of Viruses using OE security bugs, we all are seeing
   the distilled evil.

   It is analogous on how I am seeing the UNRELIABILITY of people's email
   systems.   I see only failure cases, never succesfull deliveries!


   If you want to discuss on how to put stricter filters of things
   into VGER's Majordomo, you can do that with <postmaster@vger.kernel.org>

   Doing it at lists is waste of time, and misses *MY* attention!
