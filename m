Starting 'zapping' (Gnome TV application, Version V0.6.6-1 from Debian 
unstable) gives the following error and an immediate X restart.
The overlay window is corrupted afterwards till next reboot.
Don't know, when this was introduced - it was the first time I ever 
started it, but there weren't any changes lately so I suppose this was 
in longer. Xawtv is working fine.
Linux is latest 2.5.65 from bk.
Is there anything specific I could try?

Greets,

jan
