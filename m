These folks are good at what they do and the code is GPL.
It is worth starting to consider whether this code, or code
from one of the other security-enhancement projects, should
be included in the standard kernel for 2.6 or 3.0.

A more secure Linux would be great for a lot of people, but
we need to look at the trade-offs. Does the approach damage
usability? Are there better ways? ... ?

That won't, and shouldn't, stop anyone having a good look.

So people looking at it may find bugs and vulnerabilities the
implementers hadn't considered. Great.
