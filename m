Maybe it would be a good idea to make the standard-links on www.kernel.org point to the bz2-archives?
Most people have bz2, it's smaller, there would be less traffic on the ftp and people would download faster.
(I know that I can get the bz2s in the ftp-directory, but I think most people use the links on www.kernel.org)
