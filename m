I see in the archives of this mailing list that someone was working on the
aacraid driver for the 2.4 kernel however that post was almost 2 months old.
I know Alan Cox denied inclusion of the driver due to the poor nature it was
written for the 2.2 tree. Every post that I have seen so far has just said
that Adaptec is working on it. However, I am sure there are many people out
there like myself that have to support this card in enviroments that would
be benifical to upgrade to 2.4 kernel. I am not a part of this list however
have been scouring through geocrawler.com archives of this list everyday for
the last month hoping and waiting.

Does anyone know the status of the driver or even the possibilities of it
getting included into the next kernel version (2.4.2)?

Please CC me on any replies that you may send.

Thanks for you time..
