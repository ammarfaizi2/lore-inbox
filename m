Huh? Nobody is getting blocked. Sometimes certain repetitious
"you are screwed up..." messages get deleted by the list owner,
but usually the first one-hundred or so get through.

Many bug posts don't get handled because it's expected that
you should be able to fix the bug and send a patch. That's what
the Linux-kernel list was started for. The rest of the
complaints, bitches, and noise are just the icing on the cake.
Wake up and smell the flowers --and send your patches!

Also, a lot of bug fixes get handled off-line. Only yesterday
I reported a problem with a motherboard. I have over 20 off-line
(mostly helpful) responses. Even the designer is going to try to
find the problem.

Cheers,
Dick Johnson
