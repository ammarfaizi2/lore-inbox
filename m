Building a Sparc64 kernel with the .config given below leads to these
errors at depmod time:

depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/ide/ide-mod.o
depmod:         __flush_dcache_range
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/drivers/ide/ide-probe-mod.o
depmod:         ide_xlate_1024_hook
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in /lib/modules/2.4.20/kernel/fs/binfmt_elf.o
depmod:         mem_map_zero

Exporting those symbols seems to fix it, but feels like a kludge.
