Looks good.  If Marcelo wants to alter his changelog format,
I'd vote for what Linus is doing now.  The long changelog
with email snippets is helpful.  The short format is popular.
Linus kindly gives both.

I'd like to find Alan's changelogs in his kernel.org patch
directory.  Then they would be easy to grab with ac patches.

Longer Andrea changelogs are at:
