We tried, but the last time we had something to say about your
code the message wasn't allowed on your list.

Now that the code is in the kernel, we are of the opinion that
it is no longer acceptable to censor messages when they are too
critical about the LVM source code. This beast is in the kernel,
now we'd better be allowed to talk about the source code and
maintain the thing.
