peetoo: Intel SE440BX-2 with pII 400/100/512/2.0 CPU/FSB/L2/Vccp
512MB SDRAM on 440BX + PIIX4

silly: EPoX EP-61LXA-M: Intel 440LX chipset with Celeron/333 (Mendocino)
on 66MHz FSB (5 x 66) with 192MB SDRAM

tosh: Toshiba 2210-XCDS Intel Celeron (coppermine pIII) 500MHz with 192MB SDRAM
 on Intel 440BX/ZX + PIIX4E

later: Gigabyte GA-586TX3: Intel 430TX chipset with AMD K6-2/400 on 66MHz
FSB (6 x 66) with 64MB SDRAM
