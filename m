That sounds strange to me as I have never had any problems of this kind with
swsusp and I sometimes have RAM almost 100% full before suspend
(there's 1.5 GB on my box).

First, have you tried setting the size of the image using /sys/power/image_size?

Second, the swsusp's memory shrinker has been reworked recently and the
patch should be in the latest git.  Could you please check if the problems persist
with the newest -git kernels?

Greetings,
Rafael
