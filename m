> I hope nVidia releases real 2.6 drivers soon.

its not a 2.6 issue.. its a ANY kernel with ANY driver with ANY card i
can get a hold of..i just it doesn't work.

i know the feeling. its like having a porche parked out back (back in
the AGP slot :o) ) and driving it around like a Kia Sephia. it works,
gets you around, but its something about having so much power being
unused that makes me feel back.. ( i dont even do anything 3D, or care,
this is pretty much for my opengl screen savers.. and the principle of
it )

luckily... i found  SOLUTION! im selling this NVIDIA card and getting
myself a ATI radeon 9000... if the close sourced ATI Drivers dont
work..... i can always fall back on the open ones... even if they are
not as optimized.. at least i have a choice eh?
