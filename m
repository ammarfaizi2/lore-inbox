The pnpbios driver which was being developed in the 2.4.x-acy kernel
series is now available as a patch against 2.4.17-pre4:
  http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/patch-2.4.17-pre4-pnpbios_1

A link to the patch can be found at:
  http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/tp600lnx.htm

Interested parties: Please test and report back.

Because this is the first cut of the patch and because the
driver hasn't been tested in the non-ac kernel series before,
I recommend caution, especially to Sony Vaio and Dell laptop
users.

Thomas Hood
