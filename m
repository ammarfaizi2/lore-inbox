Dean,

I do not want your help.
I do not need your help.
I would not take your help.
I would never hire you.
I will never be an associate of yours.
I will deal with my customer's needs.

No, you will not be allowed to be my customer.

So do you have the balls to step up and sue me ?
So do you have the balls to step up and sue others like me ?
So do you have the balls to step up and sue Silicon Valley embedded ?

Come on big boy, bring it on.

You wrote a TEN DOLLAR check, with only a PENNY ass to cash it with!
