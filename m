What do you think about individual email (non-list) using a confirmation
based spam blocking system.

I currently use spamassassin to filter my messages, but I saw recently a
project that asks you to reply to a confirmation message if you're not
already on the white-list.

I'm not sure how acceptable it would be, and this is a little OT, but I'm
wondering if I should spend the time testing that for my corp.
