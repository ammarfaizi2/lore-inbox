The binary drivers on Promise's website are not for the ASIC solutions 
from what I've gathered. The supported controllers are:
pdc20318
pdc20375
pdc20618

The 376 isn't listed, and I can't get it to show up when I install any 
and all of their drivers. If I am wrong, then maybe someone could help 
me here. :-)
