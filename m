When I first looked at the query form, I was overwhelmed by the
list of states.  Clicking on the link above the list takes you to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/queryhelp.cgi#status
which helps a bit.  (I'm kind of used to a shorter list of states, e.g.
"new / assigned / verifyfix / closed", but bugzilla's list doesn't
look *too* complicated.)
