Hello,

I've read in some posts to this list that there's a bug in kernel 2.4.19 
stable regarding the use of bonding.

I've setup bonding myself yesterday with the patch from 
sourceforge.net/projects/bonding and everything works as it should be

bond0 is bringing up both my nic's eth0 and eth1.

Is this because I use an external patch? Or can someone give me more 
explanation about using bonding in kernel 2.4.19. Or should I wait till 
2.4.20 is released (does someone know when this will be? +/-)

Regards,
Lao
