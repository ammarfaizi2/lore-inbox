hi,

i have a ati rage128 m3 and with the current (2.4.6) kernel X doesn't work 
together with the aty128fb framebuffer. (very strange effect, looks if only a 
very few amount of the memory is used and this is mapped!!)
with the aty128fb code from 2.4.5-ac18 X works without any problems.
at the moment i use the aty128fb code with 2.4.6 without problems.

since alans looks newer and better, will it include in 2.4.7?

greets philipp, and sorry for my bad engish ;)
