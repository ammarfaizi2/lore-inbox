Great work, the people who have systems they'd prefer not to update every
other week thank you.

Marc, I was wondering whether you had any comment on the refusal of the
debian security folks (Who I recently, and amusingly, heard described
as crack-smoking monkeys) to consider releasing an updated or patched
kernel for the latest mremap() bug which they do not believe 2.2 is
vulnerable to.

thanks,
