You could try guevenbay@tharidium.de but i don't recommend
anyone else doing so.

Documentation in languages other than English is dependant
on someone stepping forward and not only translating but also
committing to update the translation with every update of
the original.  Failure to keep the translation up-to-date is
worse than no translation.  I suppose you could ask SuSE but
they discourage even doing your own kernel build so i can't
see them dedicating the resources.
