Thanks Marcelo.  If anything needs clarifying just let me know,
or if you have specific requests for XFS changes (provided they
don't compromise "super-maintenance mode" of course).  Christoph
is also very familiar with XFS now, he might be willing to help
out reviewing that too.

cheers.

ps: thanks to everyone who chimed in with a kind word for XFS!
