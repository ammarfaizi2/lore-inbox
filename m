And remember that other companies have been doing similar things since  
just about forever. It's not as if MS invented this thing.

Or maybe I have to take that back. The "must not modify" clause certainly  
seems non-standard.

AT&T Unix source didn't carry a "must not modify" rider.

IBM's big iron OS source certainly didn't carry a "must not modify" rider.

In fact, making modifications was very much the *point* of this excercise.

Yet again. Microsoft is copying something yet failing to realize the  
point. Am I surprised? Nope.

Which is, of course, the exact opposite of what they _are_ doing.

That's a new one for me. I certainly never heard an argument for SE that  
was even remotely in that area.

I'm not so sure about that. If they really did, why would they need to  
resort to unfair tactics so often? It's not as if a 1000 pound gorilla  
couldn't easily survive a fair fight, if he wasn't a complete idiot.
