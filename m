It might be more productive to provide patches or at least generate 
constructive ideas as how to fix these problems, as you are obviously quite 
capable of doing so. Digging through the code and sending a new email to this 
list for every few flaws you find is doing little good, and your personal 
attacks on the maintainer are even less benefical. Cooperation will get you a 
lot farther than conflict.
