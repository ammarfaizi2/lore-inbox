>From my distant and peonic vantage point,
I don't see what the big deal is; Eric's messages
look perfectly fine.  Perhaps he should have cc'd linux-kernel,
but you could also argue that kbuild-devel was
exactly the right place to post discussions of
the kernel build system.  Eric is at worst guilty of
a minor misstep.  Don't pillory him; he really is simply
trying to do a good job.

Besides, it's not smart to insult a man who carries a gun :-)
