Hi all.

Now that feature freeze is just around the corner I would like to ask 
you if we will get support for packet writing in the 2.6/3.0 kernel. It 
would be especialy nice to have support for Mount Rainier which enables 
easy use of CD-RWs and that would help people (especially newbies) that 
use CD-RWs a lot.

There are some patches from Jens Axboe that are available here:
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/patches/packet/2.5/

Are patches these OK for this or would support have to be completely 
rewriten?

Thanks in advance for any information about this important feature for 
many people.

-- 
Live long and prosper!
