    Hi all :)

    I recently put a Voodoo3 2000 (AGP) card to my home linux box,
and now I have a problem in the console. When switching from X to the
console, some chars dissappear, or appear cut, etc. I've googled for
this, but with no success. Is this a known bug? Maybe an X bug?

    Sorry if this seems offtopic, but since I haven't found any
information in X forums, I think I may need some some think in the
kernel configuration (maybe DRI, who knows, I'm really lost with all
that graphics cards crap...).
