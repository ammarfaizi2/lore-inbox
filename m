Sorry, they don't _sell_ it, because this is a GPL violation. They may
distribute it. And thats about it.
And _after_ it is distributed they would have to prove the same in-depth
knowledge about the product and its source that you have being its author. Do
you think you have problems explaining your service will be better if your name
/ your companies name is written everywhere in the source (which everybody can
take a look)? Not very likely I guess.

Hm, very likely I cannot explain my point to you. My simple point is this:
The "business folks" (as you call them) have no need to change, as they mostly
act towards the needs of their respective employers. I am trying to tell you
that there are other possibilities to get into business than the one you are
preferring. There is nothing wrong with you going that direction and me going
in the opposite one, only you sound like denying that my way _exists_. And this
is wrong. Plain and simple.

Stephan
