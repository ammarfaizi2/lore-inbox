Hi,

I am trying to get 2.5.x to boot on my new Athlon 2400+ MP box. For some
reason, the kernel doesn't progress beyond

Uncompressing Linux...Ok, booting the kernel.

Complete lockup.

I am not compiling for a wrong processor architecture. I
have also tried compiling without preempt, ACPI. I have also tried passing
nomce and acpi=off. Can someone help me to figure out what is wrong ? I
could get 2.4.21-pre6 as well as the updated RedHat kernel to boot on the
same machine without any problem. 

This machine has a Gigabyte 7DPXDW-P motherboard with on-board RAID-0 and
both the disks are sitting on the Promise PDC20276 controller set to
function as a ATA/133 IDE controller.

I should also note that this machine has something wrong with the hardware
or BIOS (I don't know which and the sucker cost $2000 :-(). 2.4.x prints
out an error message saying that the MTRR settings do not match between the
two CPUs and the kernel is working around this problem. One more warning I
get with 2.4.x is that the BIOS failed to enable PCI compliance (???) or
something on those lines.

Will enabling PnP BIOS or using BIOS EDD to determine boot disk lead to
this ? I didn't want to do a binary search of options which are totally
unrelated while trying to track this down. I have attached my .config and
here is tool information:

equus % sh ver_linux
