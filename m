Fully agreed, it went through because of a lack of hours
per day and the fact that the priority of developers was
elsewhere.

For me, for example, the priorities have mostly been with
bugs that bothered me or that bothered Conectiva's customers.

If you _really_ feel this strongly about the bug, you could
either try to increase the number of hours a day for all of
us or you could talk to my boss about hiring me as a consultant
to fix the problem for you on an emergency basis :)

The other two alternatives would be either waiting until
somebody gets around to fixing the bug or sending in a patch
yourself.

Trying to piss off developers has adverse effect on all four
of the methods above :)
