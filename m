I like the VM and low latency proposals, I would really like to use ALSA
as an inducement to get people to go to 2.6. And that goes for other
filesystem types as well.

I'd like to see performance stuff in 2.4.23 for sure, since 2.6 is
probably not going to be stable or complete enough for general use for a
while.
