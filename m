Hi

Is Generic Packet tunelling in IPv6 (RFC 2473) implemented in any of the
latest linux kernels? If not, could I get it from somewhere else?

I have seen in Linux-IPv6 HOWTO that at the moment, such tunnels are more
used in test environments. And no further information..

Any pointers would be very helpful.

thanks in advance.

regards
Madhavi.
