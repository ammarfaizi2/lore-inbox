This is not a direct question about the kernel itself, so if u don't want to
help me with this just ignore it!!!!!

well, i m about to invest in a new machine, in which i will only run one of
linux distros ( haven't decided which but probably suse 7.x or red hat
7.x ).

I talked to some guys, and came up with this machine:

        Motherboard => Intel D850GB Al ( with network and sound )
        Processor => Intel P4 2 GHz
        Hard Drive => Seagate SCSI Cheata 10 000 rmp ( i think it is written
like this: Cheata ) with 16 megs of cache
        Scsi controler => adaptec scsi ultra 160 whith two channels
        Ram => 1000 mb ram 2x 512 rims
        Video card => (haven't decided but probably a geforce 2 with 64 mb
ram )

Well these are the main components that i am thinking to use for building a
new machine.

I would like u to tell me if it is a good choice, or if i should buy a dual
xenon processor machine instead.....

Also if one of u kernel hackers/and any other ppl who  has the knowlege and
patince to indicate me alll the main components of a good machine i would
appreciate that.

I am also trying to build a machine that won't give me problems with the
kernel itself... like hardware imcompatibilities..... and so on!!

and one last thing, what kind of computers do u guys use?? Tower ones as
this i am about to buy or laptop ones.

I find the laptop a funny toy, though i am not sure if it is a good
investment....

Plz some one... give me some advice so i can choose the best set up machine
possible ( and that i can affor ).

If u want to know, this machine set up  i posted plus taxes and cd-rom, and
cd-writter, costs arround 8 500 dollars i think.

I live in Europe.. and thing s tend to be more expensive than in the states.
