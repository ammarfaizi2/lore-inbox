Hi all,
in the past I've run a lot of tests against 2.5.* kernels and posted the 
results to
the list. I think they were usefull, but at the moment OSDL is doing much 
more tests
and in a much more professional way.

So the question is,
is there any kind of test that I could run ?

Thanks.

Ciao,
                        Paolo

P.S I'm not subscribed anymore to the list, so please cc me if you wanna 
reply.
