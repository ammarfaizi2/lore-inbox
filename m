There are a lot of people who don't know how to use Linux/Unix.  Windows is 
much easier for them and has more applications.  They practically have no 
other choice if they have to use a computer in their jobs (maybe they can 
Macintosh).

One of my dreams is someday Linux can really be a great desktop operating 
system, but you know that's not yet real now.
