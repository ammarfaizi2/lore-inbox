	The transmission of radio waves (any frequency, any device) is
highly regulated (FCC in US, ETSI in Europe, ...). The US governement
can't stop you from building it, but can legally prevent you to use it
and to distribute/sell it.
	Otherwise, why do you think the Ham people would bother
learning morse code ?

	Yep, some fundamental parts of 802.11 are covered with
patents. Patent search cost money, so you are on your own... In 10
years, all the patents on basic 802.11 will have expired, so you can
just wait.

	Good luck...
