	IMO, the person who makes the decision to cancel automatically takes the 
responsibility for ensuring the cancellation doesn't suppress legitimate 
content. If you don't have the time and energy to do it right, then don't do 
it.

	Spam is bad, but suppressing useful legitimate content because of 
unsophisticated spam-checking algorithms is worse. Especially in this case 
where it's not difficult to develop a more sophisticated algorithm, for 
example, one that exempts posts that started on the mailing list.
