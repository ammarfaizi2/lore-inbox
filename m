This thread seems to be related to a slashdot story about a 
mis-formulated epoxy-b that went into production circa 18-20 months 
ago.  It contains a time bomb chemical reaction involving trace 
anounts of red phosphorus, and is said to be the reason all HD makers 
went to a 1 year warranty.  You may have to google for the story now 
as I don't have a record of the link, sorry.
