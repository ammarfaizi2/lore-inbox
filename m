Hi,

where's the source code to the aurema ressource mangment modules
localted for which hooks appeared in suse's kernel tree recently?

Any module using these hooks is clearly a derived work of the
linux kernel and thus needs to be distributed under the GPL aswell.

For the LKML readers, the patches are
at:http://people.nl.linux.org/~hch/suse-crap/
