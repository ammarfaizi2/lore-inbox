Hi,

I got randomly mc hang with preempt enabled kernel.
How could it  possibly be? 

Kernel 2.4.10-pre15 and it happened both in light load
and heavy load. Anyway I have not tested this kernel
without preempt yet, so I can not say it is because
preempt feature but it is likely to be . Under heavy
load all other programms behaves so well !
