I've been mostly away from the kj mailing list, but I'm still a
janitor at heart, thank you Max for the excellent work and welcome
Domen as the new maintainer.

I'm really glad that something that I took part in starting is
having a healthy and prosperous life, with enough people to do
needed work and even volunteering to take the burden of maintaining
lots of patches, lets keep up with our collective work and continue
providing an easy and welcoming starting point for new kernel hackers!
