Hi all.
I was wondering, what module should I use for a microsoft wireless notebook
adapter mn-520?  I've tried loading orinoco_cs, as stated in a google
search,
but when I do : ifup eth0
It doesn't do anything, saying it can't find the interface.  Can someone
point me to the right module/procedure I need to use?
Also could you please send all replies directly to my address?
Thanks,
Ameer
