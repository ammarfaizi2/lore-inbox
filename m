	In other words, information does not want to be free. You shouldn't use
code the way you want to use it but the way the authors want you to use it.
After all, they didn't have to give it to you if they didn't want to.

	However, Richard Stallman does not agree with this view. It's his view that
if the authors chose to give you the code, you can use it any way you want
to, regardless of how the authors feel about that type of usage. This is why
he created the GPL.

	If you really believe that the Linux authors wished to continue to control
how their code was used, you have to think that they were stupid to release
the code under the GPL. After all, the whole point of the GPL is to prohibit
such restrictions. The reason Linux is under the GPL is so that developers
*can't* put restrictions on how the package can be used. That's the "open"
in open source.

	The person who tries to put other people's GPL'd works under his license
restrictions is the asshole. I have contributed code to the Linux kernel
under the GPL license (bonus points to anyone who can find my 25 lines of
code or so). It is nobody else's right to add code to my code and add usage
restrictions to it. The GPL expressly forbids this.

	I'm just baffled. You don't seem to understand at all why the Linux kernel
is organized under the GPL. It's precisely so that some developers can't
hijack the project and encumber the growing source base with usage and
distribution restrictions.

	The asshole is the person who thinks that they have the right to change the
express wishes of all the other contributors to the kernel who chose to
contribute to a project that operates under the GPL license. The GPL license
is about there being no restrictions on usage.

> In short:  Be honorable.

	I am. The hijackers are not.
