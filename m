Cute Teen At Home Shows Tiny Tits & AssNude 18yo Brunette With Tattoo Giving Head

God has given us two hands, one to receive with and the other to give with.
It is only the unimaginative who ever invents. The true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes.

Happiness depends more on how life strikes you than on what happens.
Who practices hospitality entertains God Himself.Fate leads him who follows it, and drags him who resist.
