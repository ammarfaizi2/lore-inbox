Interesting BUG() on boot up.

Seems to be new to 2.5.60, 2.5.58 works fine, 2.5.59 got much further
along before dying due to module problems.

The system is /quite/ dead after this, there was never a Code line
printed.

As this is all typed, I did not get the whole Call Trace, let me know if
it is needed.

First the BUG trace, then the .config
