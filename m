The URL for the linux kernel bzip2 compression support patch has changed.
Check out http://www.websamba.com/chrissicool for new versions of the patch.
The most recent version by now is 1.5.

I am still looking for people porting the kernel compression part to other
architectures, since this part is only for i386 based PCs by now. People who
are interested, please mail me.

Have fun,
