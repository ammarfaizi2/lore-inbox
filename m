	No matter how many proofs you have or how good they are, I won't believe it 
because this fails the giggle test. Here's a simple counter-proof. I want to 
write an SQL server from scratch. I create two teams, one with $50,000 and 
one with $5,000,000. You can honestly tell me that it's equally like that 
either team will produce a higher quality SQL server?

	This reminds me of the proofs that supposedly showed that locking up 
convicted criminals for longer didn't lower the crime rate. Are we honestly 
supposed to believe that otherwise honest people commit more crimes to make 
up the difference?
