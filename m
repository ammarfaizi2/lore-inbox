hi,

i put some gifs describing linux. they're in uml.
linux doesn't have class, so i tried to capture every
struct (struct is kinda class in c++) related to task_struct.

why? it's a school project. but it turned out to be a help to
understand the kernel. maybe the kernel could use more object
oriented design, like the inode?

anyway, i need some pointers and comments.
