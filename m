well, I do not know a lot in kernel ( only know compile process )
but I saw a problem there now
some hardware driver in kernel that are not stable ( Alan try to port emu10k1 driver into kernel, but got a bad result )
so I would like to suggest that to add a part to ac kernel -- driver testing kernel
and people can report bugs , complain, ..etc
after test completed, we can ask linus to add to standard kernel
I think it's better than before
maybe it's named ac1-driver1 ?
:-)
