No.  It's about recognizing the needs of more people than just the few at
the top.  Besides, with a free tool at the Head, bk could continue to be
used underneath by Linus and anyone else.   And others in the community
could use their preferred tools too.

It's not a choice between BK or nothing.   Much of the improvements you're
attributing to BK would have been realized with any other SCM system too.
