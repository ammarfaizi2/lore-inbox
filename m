Take it the other way around: 

Forgive if other people don't want to mix _your_ practices in theirs.

Not everyone wants a "giant software company", not everyone wants to compete 
againts the big players, not everyone wants to have employees or earn insane 
amounts of money. Furthermore, "giant software houses" are not going to save 
the world.

Lot of people think that a free BK _will_ be created sooner or later if it's 
needed, with or without Larry McVoy. In the same way TeX was created, or 
TCP/IP, or DNS, or smtp, or http/html... all of them were disruptive, very 
innovative, free and without any big company or lot of money to do "the real 
innovation".

BTW, for some people, ReiserFS is quite innovative, it comes from a small 
company doing services, it's free, and it seems that Hans is reasonably happy 
:-)
