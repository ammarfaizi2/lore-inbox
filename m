hello guys,

While working in X on kernel 2.4.17 on an IBM Thinkpad T20, sometimes 
the mouse pointer would just gravitate all by itself, without my moving 
the mouse or pointing stick, upwards. The first time that happened, i 
was coding in an xterm when suddenly, window focus shifted to another 
window and i noticed the mouse pointer was moving upwards by itself. 
Anyone else notice this?

Oh, and i've seen this happen too on my desktop PIII 800, but on that 
machine the pointer wasn't moving upwards, more like it was moving down 
and to the right. Weird.

Adrian
