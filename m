   The thing is, this discussion has _not_ been exactly neutral. You may have 
   said "could" or "might" or whatever, but clearly people are trying to 
   pressure hpa into going to GPL. It's the whole tone of the thread.
   
   Or would you disagree with that?
   
The tone of parts of this thread, sure.

Did my intentions match this?  Absolutely not.

I couldn't justify my use of bitkeeper if I didn't believe in
personal choice about licenses.
