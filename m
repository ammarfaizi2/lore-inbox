Hi All

I am currently planning to learn more the Dynamic power management
support of the Linux kernel.

For that am planning to write a few energy aware applications to see how
things work. But googling around dint give me much result. I read
through the Documentation folder but could not get much info.

Could some one please point to me some location where I can find
information about how to write energy aware applications? I want to
learn more about the PM subsystem of the kernel especially Dynamic power
management. Any pointer towards more resources would be a great help
towards me.

Thanks in advance
Biswa
