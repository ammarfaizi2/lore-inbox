No, a source code *offer* must be made to anyone, period.

Section 3(b) of GPLv2 says "Accompany it with a written offer ...  to give
any third party ... [the] source code".

If the source code is actually distributed with the object code, then
they need only make it available to those who obtain the object code.
Of course those folks are free to redistribute to anyone, if they want.
