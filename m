amateur, n, One lacking the skill of a professional, as in an art.
(thanks to dictionary.com for exact definition)

Now, if being able to utilize someone's style gives me the skill of a 
professional programmer, then I'm the best programmer there is, because, 
by god, I can imitate anyone's style there is. Granted, I am a skilled
professional programmer, but I've been able to do that for years. I'd go 
as far as to say that when I was learning to program, I could do it. That 
didn't make me any better at it.

I still don't see how coding style and effectiveness/correctness/usefulness
of code are related; non sequitur (it does not follow).

Anybody in my company can (and does) do that. In fact, it's a 
*requirement* here. We're required to use the same style as the author did 
in their code. In fact, there are times where I have looked at a source I 
wrote several years back, and glance over parts of it, not remembering 
that I wrote it, but nonetheless it's in my (obscure but highly readable) 
coding style. 

all goes to say that code is just another type of art form, but as with 
any art form, it can be imitated, and is imitated frequently. I still 
don't see how ability goes with coding style.
