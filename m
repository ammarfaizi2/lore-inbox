On the list above, to where OSS (hw specific) codes come?  Into a
single directory, sound/oss_native?  Or both ALSA and OSS drivers are
mixed into drivers/sound/*?
I'd like to see ALSA and OSS codes are separated into different
directories...  Otherwise it's too confusing.

And how about drivers/sound/generic for generic hardware codes such as
ac97_codec.c?

Agreed.  The hw specific header files should be bound with *.c code
together.
