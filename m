Subject: linux 2.4.20 internationalization question

Does the Linux kernel 2.4.20 support internationalization ?

If not what are the patches needed to specifically support 
internationalization for CJK locales
on linux terminals and serial consoles ?

I have been thro Markus Kuhn's UTF-8 & Linux article that points to some 
patches for the
keyboard driver. It also points to this linux console tools project which I 
understand is some
rearchitecture of tty and keyboard drivers. But I am not sure if the linux 
kernel 2.4.20 uses
these ?

I would appreciate if some one could help me in this regard as to what needs 
to be done
if at all ?

Ofcourse, I am a newbie to the kernel and am not familiar with it.
Thanks,
Shesh.
