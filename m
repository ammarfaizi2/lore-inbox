That makes perfect sense. If it helped to articulate and understand your
ideas and concerns, this is certainly an important starting point.

Great! However, I suggest that you should explore this idea yourself.
Only you can eventually articulate the requirements and solutions in
your code; you cannot expect others to go look at it and guess them.
