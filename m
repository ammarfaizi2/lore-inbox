Attn Sir/Madam,

My name is Ben Egobia, i am the managing director of Prudent Bank PLC  here in Nigeria, on 20th Novmber 2004 MR. Haryanto Tomo from  indonesia, deposited the sum of U$10million dollars with our bank here in Nigeria, up till then i did not hear from him not untill when i received a news that there was a tsunami in asia that killed thousands of  indonesians, including one of nigerian Prudent bank customer, Mr.Haryanto.
 
Right now i am contacting you to know if you can help me to receive the money over there as his relatives or next of kin, since all my effort to locate his family with the telephone number he gave me (62853700612) proved nothing, if you are willing to do this deal, you should not in any reason tell anybody about this transaction untill you confirm the money in your account/home, because all we need is to get the document of  (change of onwership account from the federal high court) on your behalf. Always call me on my direct line+ 234-80-2433-6966 for  security reasons or email me on:  ben123451@indiatimes.com
               
Waiting for your call now
Ben Egobia
