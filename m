Hi,

At least there are some trees which already include it. Maybe there will 
be some more people using kbuild-2.5 in their trees within a few 
weeks/monthes, and maybe one day - may not be today, may not be tomorrow - 
but one day it will get into the common tree.

Anyway, he shouldn't be. There are lots of people appreciating his work, 
and many of us are very grateful for it. So am I. It's going to be a long 
way, but finally kbuild-2.4 can't stand while kbuild-2.5 (hopefully) goes 
on. So we'll get it in by some time in the future.

Regards,
Thunder
