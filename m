I don't understand why BK is part of the conversation.  It has nothing to
do with it.  If every time I post to this list the assumption is that it's
"time to beat larry up about BK" then it's time for me to get off the list.

I can understand it when we're discussing BK; other than that, it's pretty
friggin lame.  If that's what was behind your posts, Alan, there is an
easy procmail fix for that.
