I just upgradede my system to an 1200Mhz AMD Athlon Thundirbird (266Mhz FSB) processor  / 512Meg of RAM, and an Asus kt7a motherboard.  

It is oppsing left and right.  I recompiled the kernel with Athelon as the CPU but keep getting these oopses..

I also get these same problems while trying to install RH 7.1

Anyone know is this a supported processor / MB and has anyone had these problems?

Joe please cc me as I am not on this list.
