We have 8 running dual-Athlons which are basically Einux 1200s 
(http://www.einux.com/A1200.html).  We have our first pair of MP1700-based 
systems going in this week, so I can't say much about those yet.

We had some trouble with a couple of bad boards from Tyan's first batch or 
so.  Also, more than 2 Kentron 256MB modules didn't work well together.  
Those first couple weeks were rough, but we switched to 512MB modules and 
they have been rock solid ever since.

The XP processors may or may not work, but I would have a tough time 
justifying it to customers if we had system problems from us cheaping out 
on unsupported configs.
