This is actually terribly OT, but have you tested with a different MTA?
I'm using Postfix in production and most of my clients like running the
latest and "greatest" Microsoft has to offer and so far so good. Regarding
"hidden" emails, i think its called spyware ;) But IMO if your MTA is
spewing chunks under load then its an MTA problem, however if your OS
spews chunks in the process then its obviously an OS problem (e.g. your
W2k box BSODing).
