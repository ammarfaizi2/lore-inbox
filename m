You see, it's people like you that actually further along projects such
as that.. "oh, it'll never work! blahblahblah!" well gee, X _has_ been
around for years....... but so's microsoft........ so we've all gotten
into this paradigm that linux is THE end solution for microsoft users...
got news for ya bud, Linux is great, it's dope, but quite frankly, if u
put all yer eggs in one basket, you become blind to everything else.... 
and bill gates likes that......... but WAIT! someone ELSE comes along with an
open project.... and what do you do? u take a hateful stance to it... do
we see a pattern here?  you'd have to be pretty blind not to.
