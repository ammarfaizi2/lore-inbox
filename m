If you wanted to add a feature which would overwrite the file when 
removed or truncated I'd be happy. Yes I know about attributes and dban, 
and I have a version of rm which does that if people use it, but would 
be nice to have it on the whole filesystem. It's not proof against a 
TLA, but nice for casual snooping.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
