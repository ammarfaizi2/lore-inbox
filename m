 it's not a buggered piece of overgrown sh*t like GNU emacs.  There.
 I've said it. " (Linus Torvalds, 1 Dec 2000)

"I use "microemacs" (which has got nothing to
 do with "real emacs" other than having keybindings that are close enough
 to be confusing)." (Linus Torvalds, 23 Apr 1998)

"I'm distrustful of projects that do not have well-defined goals, and
 well-defined interfaces.  They tend to bloat and do "everything" over
 time.  This is what gives us horrors like GNU emacs and Mach: they
 don't try to do one thing well, they try to do _everything_ based on
 some loose principle" (Linus Torvalds, 26 Mar 1998)

"First off, I don't like a lot of the elitism that does on among Linux
 hackers.[...] If you think using Un*x makes you some kind of super
 genius who should be feared by mere mortals and
 end users, either get over it or start using *BSD. *BSD users (and
 developers) are all complete jackasses, so you'll fit right in."
