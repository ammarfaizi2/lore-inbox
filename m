Sorry to interrupt but I wanted to mention that if the code you are refering to
was writtent by a NIST researcher it should be copyright free (aka public
domain).  Works such as code created by a United States govenrment agency are
not copyrightable as the government is a public agency and therefore "The
People" own whatever they create.
