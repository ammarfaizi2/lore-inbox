Please leave as a reminder to me and anyone else about what can happen if
civility (sp) is lost.

He had good intentions, and was as bull-headed as me.
What one admires and hates in the same thought.
I wish I had time to look at what he did, and invite him back to express
his ideas again for the next round in 2.7.  It would be foolish to not
consider some of the changes and ideas as positive.

The difference is the knowledge base, and having proven in the past it can
be done, but the rules are freaking ugly.

And they just got worse!

One of the issues we will now be faced once the chipsets are fully modular
is the issue of OEMS refusing to continue to open spec their hardware.
This is the gamble Linux took, lets hope I and others managed to make a
big enough cannon ball splash to scare them into not going down that path.
