The problem is that you can't trust a company. You may choose to
trust people who control or shape a company, but they may lose
that control, and then all bets are off.

Something like the "KDE Free Qt Foundation" may work to protect the
interests of both sides. It certainly looks fine to me, but maybe
I'm just not crooked enough to see the loopholes.

2. Give it away and still make lots of money.

Proving this is left as an exercise to the reader ;-)
