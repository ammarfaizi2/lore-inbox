I do believe that's an excerpt from a line from the movie "Pulp Fiction,"
written and directed by Quentin Tarrantino.

The full line is (if memory serves me right):

"What now? I'll tell you what now. I'm gonna get me some hard,
 pipe-hittin' n***as, and they're gonna go to work on mr.
 soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain
 rapist here with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch. That's what now."

I really shouldn't pollute the list like this.
