	You could do that be means of a contract, but I don't think you could it do
by means of a copyright license. The problem is that there is no right to
control the distribution of derivative works for you to withhold from me.

	Yes, but this would be valid if and only if there was a right to restrict
the distribution of derivative works that was recognized under copyright
law. I can find no record of the existence of such a right.

	Well that's the problem. While copyright law does permit you to restrict
the right to create derivative works, it doesn't permit you to restrict the
distribution of lawfully created derivative works to licensees of the
original work. As far as I know, no law has ever granted this right to
copyright holders and no court has ever recognized this right. And I've
looked. Courts have specifically recognized the absence of this right.
