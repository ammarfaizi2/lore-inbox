Well, since the code Daniel was referring to having debugged (ptrace and
thread debacle earlier) was broken and he successfully fixed it -- he is
welcome to come near code as far as I am concerned.

In short, he and Ingo fixed some messed up code and that is all that
matters.  I do not care if he uses a debugger or a magic ball, so long
as he fixes it.

Personally, I do not use a debugger and it is partly because of the
reasons you list.  But if Daniel can fix a problem (which he most likely
ran into firsthand with his work on gcc and gdb) then he is welcome in
my eyes.

Please, give it up.
