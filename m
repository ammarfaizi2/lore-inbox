  Can't.  We don't have subscribers in   anzeider-luzern.ch  domain.
  Hmm..  We do seem to have   dill_fritz@gmx.net   is that your address ?

  This would be very easily solved, if you could supply me
  (at:  postmaster@vger.kernel.org)  all the  "Received:"  headers
  from a message that has arrived via  linux-kernel   list.

  All emails have those "Received:" headers,  most microsoft email
  clients just make it absolutely horribly difficult to see them.
  There are apparently as many ways as there are software versions:
