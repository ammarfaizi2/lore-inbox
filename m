I had to move my patches off of junker.org and back to http://osinvestor.com/
which also changed the timestamp on the file.  I really have been meaning to
keep the patch updated (and continue working on stuff), as well as submit
stuff for 2.5, but I've just been really busy.  At this point, I'd be quite
happy to let someone else submit my work for 2.5 or 2.4.

Regards,
Rob Radez
