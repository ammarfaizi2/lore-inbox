I do not know about Mr. Hedrick's specifics, but in NDA's involved in
settlement negotiations there are often non-disclosure clauses that are
at least in effect until settlement is reached, and some times beyond. 
I have also had to sign contracts that require I do not disclose
anything I learn on the job, except to law enforcement personnel. 
Andre's situation may be like this.   Sure, he can report it, but he
can't talk about it to anyone else!
