It seems there is some internal communication problem inside your 
company:

This is far from being a "new process", you already offered this for 
some time at http://linuxbugsdb.coverity.com/ (with the exception that 
you stopped updating the results half a year ago).

If you as the CTO didn't know about this it is giving a very bad 
impression of your company.

Some questions regarding this move:
- can you migrate the accounts from linuxbugsdb.coverity.com?
- are the comments Linux kernel developers like me did at 
  linuxbugsdb.coverity.com migrated to scan.coverity.com or was this 
  wasted work?


Another thing you could give a small clarification about:
Your email sounds as if your offer was like a charity offer from 
Coverity, Inc.

OTOH, I remember press rumors of Coverity, Inc getting 297 000 Dollar 
for this from the Department of Homeland Security.

I'm sure you are not silently omitting that you are getting public 
fundings for what you are offering, but an official statement would be 
nice.
