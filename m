Hehe, forgot to specify which kernel source I read
this from.  Well, the first issue seems to be present
in all of the 2.4 kernels, and 2.5 -- I haven't
checked 2.6 yet.

The second bug seems to be fixed in 2.4.9 (and maybe
lower) and 2.5, and probably 2.6, therefore.


If anymore info is needed, let me know.



Thank you for your time.
Shaun.
