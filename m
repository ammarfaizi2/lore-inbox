Rik was more than polite in his response to this paragraph.
My comment would be more to the point of "Don't judge stuff
until you've understood it."

Yes. Serial terminals, telnet sessions, hercules monitors serving as
secondary heads, ... And believe it or not, lots of people prefer the
classic VGA 80x25 textmode to do their work even on high-end 21" screens.
In fact anyone who's tried to convince me that having white background
all over the userland (Hello MS Visual C GUI) is actually _ergonomic_
failed miserably. (Ever had a headache from staring into high res graphics
with bright backgrounds? Suppose you've had, just like everyone else.)
