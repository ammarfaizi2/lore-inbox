Sorry, I had forgotten about the recent changes to the kernel side of the
hotplug interface, i.e. that it now needs a kobject to work.
It used to be possible to just call_usermodehelper() with hotplug_path
as its argv[0], but that is currently being phased out.

You also shouldn't create a class device every time you want to call
kobject_hotplug. Note that every character device already has a class
device associated with it, so you might be able to just use that to call 
kobject_hotplug on it.

If there is no obvious way to do that, just leave the code as it is
for calling the helper.

Ok, understood. I think you should make that an extra patch and completely
remove that feature from the base patchset in order to make it less
controversial.

I don't understand. Does the kernel code need to wait for the helper
to finish while holding the semaphore? AFAICS, the helper is completely
asynchronous, so it can simply do its job when the kernel has given
up the semaphore.

No, probably not. Maybe just remove that sentence from the text.

Yes, that makes sense.

ok.

Hmm. One of us has misunderstood the interaction between 
call_usermodehelper() and acquire_console_sem(). If I'm the one
who's wrong, please tell me where that semaphore is held.

It definitely is. Actually, it would be preferred to have only a single
value as ioctl argument (or even better, no ioctl at all), but if you
need to pass an aggregate data type, it should at least have an identical
layout for all architectures. That means every member should be naturally
aligned and you can't use pointers or other types that have sizeof(x)
== sizeof(long).
