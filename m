Thank you for all your work, its greatly appreciated. I think its time to f=
ix=20
public kernel headers so they can be included in userspace oh well I=20
hear "Don't include kernel headers in userspace" flames already but some=20
things are impossible without including kernel headers ( ide/v4l etc comes =
to=20
mind ).

Regards,
ismail
