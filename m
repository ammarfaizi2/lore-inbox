Subject: [OT] man-pages-1.70, new maintainer
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Just released man-pages-1.70. Find it the usual places.

Due to a decreasing amount of time and increasing RSI,
maintaining the man-pages package became difficult.
Fortunately Michael Kerrisk has accepted to take over.
Send corrections and additions to mtk-manpages@gmx.net .

Andries - that was 9 years
