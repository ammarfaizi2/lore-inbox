I remember trying stock 2.4.7...it was the first 2.4.x kernel I tried
and I wasn't all that impressed (and i had a plethora of problems).  I
didn't like 2.4.9 much either to be honest, but it was a lot better than
earlier 2.4.x releases.  2.4.x is where I learned exactly what Larry
stated earlier in the thread about stable kernels taking a while to
actually stabilize.  But when they do, the result is quite worth it.=20
And for the record, I'm finding 2.6-test kernels more stable than early
2.4.x release kernels, so I think you guys have a come a long way and
done an awesome job.  I think 2.6 is going to be a kernel that blows
away people who whined about 2.4s desktop performance.

Kudos guys for a job well done,

Stan
