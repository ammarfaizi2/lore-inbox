Not anytime soon, methinks.  Verizon was one of the first ISP's to block Gnutella 
on their networks, and are unresponsive to any appeals to unblock it.  I've sent a 
nastygram to their security "experts", and am actively seeking another ISP - I 
think there are 1 or 2 other DSL providers in my area.

It's a shame, really - their field techs are top-notch and I've had no 
connectivity issues in 3 years, but the PHBs who set policy are as bad as my 
bosses at Greyhound - which is a major insult, in my book.

In the meantime, I'll just be a Virginia boy with a .co.uk e-mail address :)
