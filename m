The phrase "get a root" is entertainingly ambiguous in this context, is it not?

Storytelling is the most effective form of exposition.  It's a way to pull
technical issues out of the realm of abstraction, and help designers 
realize that there are (at least potentially) real people involved.

I recommend it.  Not just for communicating with others, but for your
own thought experiments in design.
