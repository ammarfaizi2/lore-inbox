I tried to give you some pointers in a personal email. So it's not true
you didn't receive any response. Also reminded you of the best place to
look for info, namely, that driver's mailing list. You don't seem to
have made any additional attempts at resolving it yourself since you
reposted your original message. Get newer kernel sources, read the
driver's documentation more thoroughly.
