There does appear to be some demand for variants which include things 
like high-performance rendering, ray tracing, etc.  I would enjoy 
working with people who need this sort of thing.

It's "how can we make each other happy".  You're happy with freedom in 
your products, my employer is happy with profit, and I'm happy to spend 
my time being a chip architect.  :)
