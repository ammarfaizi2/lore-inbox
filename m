Debian doesn't seem to care much about the possible legal problems of 
patents.

The firmware issues are an urgent real problem?


Debian should define how much legal risk they are willing to impose on 
their mirrors and distributors and should act accordingly in all areas.

But ignoring some areas while being more religious than RMS in other 
areas is simply silly.

"SCO disaster"?

It is a disaster for SCO.
