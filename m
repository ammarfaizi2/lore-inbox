Forgive me because this is one of my first attempts at anything related to the
kernel, but...

1) How would I go about benchmarking this?
2) If the out-of-line code is executed anyway (since load_pointer() calls __load_pointer()),
would it really effect it very much?

I've been programming as a hobby for a few years, but I never really worried
about inlining my code. Most likely because when I was learning C, I was using
books etc. that were written before C99 was out.

Thanks
