Anybody know where the website to get the patch to use pppd with kernel code 
went?

Apparently, 2.4.1 is still the latest version of ppp...

http://va.samba.org/ppp/

And it doesn't support pppoe.  It needs a patch, which used to be available 
from...

http://www.shoshin.uwaterloo.ca/~mostrows

Which is giving me a 404.

Any clues?

Might be possible to get the patch out of the google cache or the wayback 
machine, wo knows...

Rob
