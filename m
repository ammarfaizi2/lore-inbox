Hi Folks:  I was wondering if anyone knew of any driver support for
the system monitoring functions of the Winbond w83697hf or any of that
family of support chips.

I have done searches on google and through the 2.4.20 source code but
can only find reference to the chip as an identifier in the parport_pc.c
file.  Google finds nothing accept as a component on many mother
boards.

Any pointers would be appreciated.
  Kirk
