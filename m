OK, I hate to CC all these lists, but I guess it would be best
to try and end this thread now ;)

If you want to learn about the structure of the Linux kernel,
you should probably go to:

	http://kernelnewbies.org/
and
	irc.openprojects.net   #kernelnewbies

You can also try the mailing list:

	echo subscribe kernelnewbies | mail  majordomo@kernelnewbies.org

----
And please ... stop this thread on all the other mailing lists,
move your discussions to a more suitable forum and limit it to
that forum.

regards,

Rik
