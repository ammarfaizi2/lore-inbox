A bug tracking system stick you on a bug and makes all this to look like
real work, that's why maybe David does not like it :) Kidding ;) The good
of a bug tracking system against the mailing list is that bugs do survive
in a bug tracking system, while they usually vanish for normal underlooked
posts. Many ppl posting bugs are not members of the mailing list and they
are not usually setting up a repost timer if the bug does not get
answered. I believe that it should be both ways. Posts on the mailing list
helps main maintainers to lower the load by allowing others to take on
bugs, while the bug tracking helps unresolved bugs to stick.
