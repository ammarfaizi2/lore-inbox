Larry, I'd like to remember You that science progress has been made by
people that forced common knowledge, starting from Platone spherical earth
up to Einstain theory of relativity.
A lot of failures sure, but a single success is enough to pay out.
The _main_ difference with the two examples is that earth has always been
spherical and sub-atomic mechanics is always been in that way, while
technology progress could make someone else to succeed where you failed
time ago.
