Yes, but APC UPS have big 3-inch fans blowing air over the batteries  
to keep them from overheating; laptops dont. Besides which, have you  
ever stuck your hand on a UPS while it's running a server on  
battery?  Those things get damn hot even with the fans, not even  
considering the fact that a lead-acid battery is much more efficient  
about storing and using energy than a Lithium-ion battery.

Incidentally, my UPS thermometer tells me that the peak load on- 
battery temp is more than 120 F; would you _really_ want that sitting  
on your lap in addition to all the heat generated by CPU, ram, GPU, etc?

There are real applications out there that have these problems, in  
fact a lot of manufacturers have issued recalls because of exploding  
batteries, power bricks, etc, indicating that this is not a simple  
problem.

Cheers,
