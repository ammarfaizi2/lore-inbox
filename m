I am running this under 2.4.3. I will be testing 2.4.7 this afternoon to see 
if I can fix the problem.

The board works fine with a uniprocessor kernel.

When booking under the stock mandrake 8.0 kernel, I get cascading error 
messages about clock problems and blaming a VIA686A chipset.

This has a VT82C686B PCI chipset.

I tried to find info on the web on this and was not ver successful.  (This is 
at a friend's house.  He is out in the middle on nowhere and is lucky if he 
get 28.8k connections.)

It this one of the non-correctable VIA chipsets?  Is there a workaround for 
this?

It is a dual P-III 733 with a gig of ram. I would hate to see it go to waste. 
 (Actually it will because it is not at MY house, but that is another 
problem. ]:> )

I was going to get one of these boards. I am glad I did not...
