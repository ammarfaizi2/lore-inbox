But, naturally, you can't reveal the precise files and lines of code that
SCO claim was stolen. For $DEITY's sake, you're still a Canopy stooge and
hanger on, even though you're smart enough to know better. How much did
NFT or Canopy give you to agree to this preposterous claim?

Welcome to my killfile.
