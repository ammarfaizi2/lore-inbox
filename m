The lawsuit is impacting their sales finally.  They are telling this to 
folks they are moving off Linux long term.  I don't know
if it's a smoke screen due to the lawsuit or an actual technical 
business decision.  I would guess they are making a back door
to pull out if the lawsuit goes south.  Looks like it might be based on 
filings on the 12/22 but I don't know for certain.
