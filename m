Compared to my ordinary mailboxes (both private and work) the amount of 
spam I get from lkml is quite small.

The traditional reply to that is no. It would prevent a lot of bug-reports 
from users from reaching the list as well as other useful stuff from 
people who want to contribute one or two things but don't actually want to 
read the list.

This is actually covered in the LKML FAQ (http://www.tux.org/lkml/), take 
a look at these entries: 

http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s3-3

http://www.tux.org/lkml/#s3-14
A small quote from that one "...Some of the good kernel development people 
cannot keep up with the volume on linux-kernel. But they do occasionally 
post. Therefore we need to keep the submissions open for "everybody". Some 
of the other important people have two or three Email addresses. They too 
need to post from different addresses. ..."
