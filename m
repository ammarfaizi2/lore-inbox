Well just to make my point clear. I trust you and I thing that you indeed
know better then me on ARM stuff. (At least you can run it on
more then my tinny PSION 5mx... where I still didn't revert to
the original OS, quite cute this little thing under linux :-).
But I wouldn't have minded it at all if you had just sendid
the ARM adjustments directly to Linus!
In the particular case we had it was however good to
have some direct communication in front
just to resolve the API issues. OK?
