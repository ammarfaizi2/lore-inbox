I have noticed somewhat less of the "I sent this patch to linus nine times 
now and never heard back" kind of discussion.  Can't say I miss it. :)

Patches might be going in with less discussion simply because they're going 
in more quickly and easily, rather than sitting around for weeks with 
everybody second-guessing them simply because Linus didn't notice them until 
the fifth resend.  If it no longer takes two months to get an otherwise 
completed patch into the tree, then yes, there will be less discussion of it 
on the list.

There's still plenty of discussion AFTER they go in.  And they have been 
known to get reverted (and/or "cleaned up" with a weed-whacker)...
