Our intention is to release X15 with an open source license.

This will happen as soon as the codebase stabilizes a bit, that is when we go
beta (in two - three weeks).

At the moment we just don't have the time...

The reason why I released the alpha binary version is that several people
would not believe that a user-space server with this level of performance
would be possible at all and several statements that I made on this list were
challenged.

Besides I really appreciate the feedback that I received so far from Ingo and
others, and I'd be very curious to know if anybody did any performance
evaluation at all.
