Sorry, but that's just plain wrong.  Whatever you email to someone, you'd
better be prepared to have appear in public, just as if you had said it to
them.

If you want some other arrangment, get a signed contract from them before
you email to them.  Or be nice to people, that's another way to get them
to respect your wishes.

Regards,

Daniel
