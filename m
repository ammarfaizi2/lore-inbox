Keep in mind Linus gets flooded by patches on a constant basis and also
needs to focus on getting core functions working again so I wouldn't be
supprised if he hasn't had time to deal with XFS yet.

Hes also known for just deleting his mail que when it gets overloaded so
he may not have even read the messages in question.
