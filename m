Hello All,
I'm not subscribed to the linux kernel mailing list, I just browse the
archives. If you want to answer back you will have to do it directly or wait
a while for me to read.

I have not heard the goal of Total World Domination stated lately. Do you
guys think this could be why we've had a slow down in linux adoption and IT
growth? I don't really believe its a economic slowdown, I think we've just
lost sight of the bigger picture.

Now returning to your regularly scheduled broadcast.
Marry Christmas
Steven Edwards
