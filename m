I'm _eagerly_ awaiting more information :)

There's a project on sourceforge, alas it hasn't gone anywhere in the 
several months that it's been there.  I'm relying on my laptop to route 
for me because it has builtin wireless/lan on it and I really need 
network access on my desktop.  I now have two linksys wireless pieces 
of...stuff, and neither are supported or supported well.  I.e the WMP11 
and the WUSB11.

The WUSB11 is slowly moving along, but it's far behind 2.6.0.

I used to by Linksys net Netgear stuff because they were reliable and 
they sometimes stated "Linux" directly on the product box.  These days 
I'm starting to get jaded.  It seems that the 'buzzword hype' of putting 
"Linux" on the box has disappeared.  Pretty fscking annoying when the 
community that can best improve a driver and freely at that, is occluded.

Getting back to the subject.  I have both the WUSB11 and the WMP11 and 
I'm more than willing to provide data for testing.  Even if I gotta 
hardwire the things with baling wire and bubble gum, I gotta get one of 
them working.

p.s. To Erik: yes, I know the article was spun :(  I read Andrew's 
original post.  Unfortunately it was spun to say that BC made linux 
people happy.
