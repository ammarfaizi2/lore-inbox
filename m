The GCC code generator appears to have been rewritten between 3.4.6 and 
4.1.1....

I took a look at the dump he posted and there are some minor and some massive 
differences between the code. In one case some of the code is swapped, in 
another there is code in the 3.4.6 version that isn't in the 4.1.1... Finally 
the 4.1.1 version of the function has what appears to be function calls and 
these don't appear in the code generated by 3.4.6

In other words - the code generation for 4.1.1 appears to be broken when it 
comes to generating system code.
