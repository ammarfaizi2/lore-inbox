Seems like Im missing /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed
on my Intel Centrino using 2.6.0-test3-mm2.
What options do I need to have in kernel for scaling to work?
I have CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_CENTRINO in my config and here are who 
snippets from my dmesg:

    speedstep-centrino: found "Intel(R) Pentium(R) M processor 1300MHz": 
max frequency: 1300000kHz

and

    cpufreq: No CPUs supporting ACPI performance management found.

What am I missing here? Any more config options needed?
Attaching full .config and dmesg
