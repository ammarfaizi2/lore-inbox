Are you volunteering to set up such a business for Andre, or
are you just doing vague ideological handwaving ?

Andre does release his software eventually, after he has
recovered the development costs.  This is a lot more than
what most developers do and I am thankful that Andre's
business model means both an income for him and high quality
free software drivers.

No, you haven't told us why.

Does that also mean that if somebody called on you to do what
you're asking others to do (create free software while earning
money with it), you wouldn't do it ?

So you're asking, in the name of freedom, that other people should
limit their freedom ?

I wouldn't call it idealism, I call it hypocricy.
