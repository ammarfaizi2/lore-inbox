Sir,

US$21,500,000.00 ONLY =94
I, on behalf of my other colleagues from Government Constituted Contract =
Review Panel decided to solicit your assistance as regards transfer of the =
above mentioned amount into your Bank Account.  Note that, these funds =
emanated from unclaimed contractual proceeds of contracting firms who could =
not meet their financial obligation to their creditors. Consequently, these =
firms went bankrupt and total liquidation.
We as holders of sensitive positions in our various parastatals were mandated =
by the Federal Government to scrutinize all payment made to certain foreign =
contractors and we discovered that some of the contractors have not been paid =
their contractual entitlement which collectively left an amazing sum of =
US$26,500,000.00 Only (Twenty Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars =
Only) lying in a suspense Account.  However, from our extensive =
investigation, we discovered that the foreign beneficiary companies have =
since been liquidated and no longer existing for some years which motivated =
our intention, knowing fully well that all operations would be exceedingly =
smooth and completely safe for all the parties concerned.
We have agreed on this side that the said amount would be transferred (for =
own use) into a Bank Account provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate, =
because we are serving Government workers and the Civil Service Code does not =
allow us to operate foreign Account/Company, more so there must be some sort =
of documents to show that it is for the contract that the funds is released =
for.
Following our intention to carry out this laudable project expediently we =
however, succeeded in transferring part of this amount (money) precisely =
US$5M (Five Million US Dollars) only into a Foreign Bank Account in =
Switzerland, but the provider of the Account is up to some mischief and =
refused to comply with our earlier mutual agreement insisting that the total =
amount be paid into his nominated Bank Account before disbursement will take =
effect.  We thus, believe and concluded that if in the first successful =
transfer of US$5M (Five Million US$ Dollars) we were not compensated how then =
are we sure that when the balance of US$21,500,000.00 Only, (Twenty One =
Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) is transferred into his =
Account that we will be sure of our due compensation.
In light of the foregoing, we are therefore seeking your assistance so that =
the remaining amount of US$21,500,000.00 only can be speedily processed and =
fully remitted into your nominated Bank Account.
You are expected therefore to furnish us with your company and bank details =
i.e.
(1) Name of company and addr(2) Name of nominated Bank Account suitable for =
this project, with ABA or Swift Code (If any)
(3) Name of Beneficiary to the Account.
On successful remittance of the fund into your Account you will be =
compensated with 20% of the amount for your valuable assistance and =
co-operation. So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive positions, =
we cannot afford a slip in this transaction, neither can we give our =
identities as regards our respective offices, but were relationship =
confidently established and smooth operations commences, you will be =
furnished with all you deserve to know.
I am disposed to entertain any question(s) from you with respect to this =
transaction, Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost =
urgency, for confidentiality reasons and to avoid exposure, please direct =
your  reply to the under detailed Telephone and Fax number.
Yours faithfully,
MR.ERNEST COLMAN.
