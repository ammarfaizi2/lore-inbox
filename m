And me. And in reality there is nothing really wrong with that. The world
isn't black and white - it's not Windows or Linux either. For a corporation
of eg. 20.000 Windows desktops, you need a lot of convincing to switch the desktop
to Linux. Even if one of your core products is Linux based. 
The fact is that your corporate desktop has little or nothing to do with your 
products. Get it ? If that WERE the case, a lot of the corporations still 
writing and shipping OS/390 software would have a serious problem. 
(been there and done that too)

So, please, don't blame Outlook in this context - it IS a user problem - Outlook
is just a *relatively* innocent mail-client.
