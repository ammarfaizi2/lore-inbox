I am trying to compile 2.5.7 kernel but something goes wrong.
Here are the results of make bzImage:

make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o: In function `sys_call_table':
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o(.data+0x300): undefined reference to 
`sys_nfsservctl' make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

Here is my configuration too:
