/usr/src/linux/drivers/usb/storage/usb.c, look for:

/* This is the list of devices we recognize, along with their flag data */

/* The vendor name should be kept at eight characters or less, and
 * the product name should be kept at 16 characters or less. If a device
 * has the US_FL_DUMMY_INQUIRY flag, then the vendor and product names
 * normally generated by a device thorugh the INQUIRY response will be
 * taken from this list, and this is the reason for the above size
 * restriction. However, if the flag is not present, then you
 * are free to use as many characters as you like.
