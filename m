During my medical training, it was made abundantly clear that the
plural of virus is virii. Since the whole idea of a computer virus
comes from the medical world, I'd have to assume the terminology came
with it.

I'll stick with what my training taught me.

Best wishes from Riley.

PS: Plural of bacteria is bacterium, from the same source.
