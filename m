This is exactly what is done with the KPLUG mailing lists (Kernel-Panic Linux User Group - www.kernel-panic.org). Attachments are not allowed by the mail server
and anyone sending HTML/RTF format mail gets an earful (eyeful?) from other list members.

Of course this would not stop Subseven propagation (generally, Subseven is attached to a web site and an e-mail is sent to you with a link to that site.
Clicking on the link, loading the site, infects your Windows box), but then this is a case where simple education is the way to stop propagation.
