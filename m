Actually, they are not that inaccurate, considering that there is no
such thing as "X Windows".

The name of the software you are refering to is The X Window System,
or just X.  The version that is commonly in use these days is often
called X11R6, X11, or R6.

Why is this mistake almost never mentioned, and yet the discussions
about whether Linux or GNU/Linux is the correct never seem to stop?

John.
