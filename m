No, it isn't.  There are situations in which we would like to suspend "whatever
it takes" and then we should be able to free as much memory as _really_
possible.

Besides, it is supposed to work, and it doesn't, so it needs fixing.

Well, that's not the only possibility.  After we fix the memory freeing issue
we can use the observation that page cache pages need not be saved
to disk during suspend, because they already are in a storage.  We only
need to create a map of these pages during suspend with the information
on where to get them from and prefetch them into memory during resume
independently of the page fault mechanism.

This way we won't have to actually save anything before we snapshot the
system and the system should be reasonably responsive after resume.

Greetings,
Rafael
