If you wish, your comment could reflect the fact that a more advanced
version is available under 2.4 and is being actively maintained and
enhanced. It has been ported to 2.5 and is being kept in sync with a
view to inclusion in 2.5 or 2.6. It may not be in the kernel tree by the
time 2.6 is released, but I will do my utmost to ensure the patches are
maintained, since I plan in using it! :>

Nigel
