Perhaps it was me, don't remember. I sent out mine to quite a few people 
who asked me... I installed 2.4.10 + vmware 3 beta and it worked out of the 
box (compilation gave some warnings with gcc-2.96/Redhat version but it 
worked fine).

I can only suggest you to do the same as someone else already pointed out...

Regards,

         Anton
