Just wanted to express my gratitude for Dave Jones' excellent
post-halloween document, otherwise known as "what to expect in 2.5".
Version 0.21 is current as of 2.5.57, and contains the answers to all
the questions *I* had about things like /sbin/update becoming obsolete.
It's a quick read, and well worth your time.

Yes, I'll include the URL :-).
