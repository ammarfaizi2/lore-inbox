"Sounds like?"  Sure.  It kind of does, now that you mention it.

Regradless of the similarities and the validity of Pascal's argument, my
  argument, I think, stands.  I outlined the four potential futures.  We
  have control over only one bit, Microsoft has the other.  The tech sounds
  nice, it is an interesting avenue to persue, Pascal aside.

I don't see any reason why we *shouldn't* look at the problem and try to
  do it.  What reasons do you see for not persuing the problem to its
  inevitible implementation?

I see big pitfalls in *not* looking at the problem.  In what respect are
  the pitfalls of ignoring it as outlined by me invalid?

mfG,

Joseph

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive? http://swpat.ffii.org/players/microsoft
