Connector allows to hide transport layer completely - 
concider acrypto or superio - that subsystems do not know
about network, author of the temperature driver for superio
should not know how skb is allocated and processed, 
and acrypto is not network related system, so why
they should know about network API?
Why should they know what is skb, how it is allocated, 
why shared skb can not be used in netlink and so on?
Users of the connector are only cared about
destination ID and how to send/receive message.
And what to do if we do not want something like connector
to be used for userspace control - we need to create
each time new netlink socket unit, like kobject's one,
or netlink_ulog, we need to register it in netlink.h, 
where already there too many units.

When connector was created in the middle of 2004, it's main aim
was allowing easy userspace control over netlink.
Creating it's own skb receive parser was acceptible for
one project, for two, but it is definitely not the solution
for general use. And also I think it is not so easy to include new
netlink family unit for some completely unrelated to network subsystem.

So I decided to create only one skb parser, and put all skb processing
in one place, so any user has to do only registration with it's 
own receive callback, and sending function.

Thus, transport layer was completely hidden from connector users,
there are no complex netlink macros there, no network API
and all complex related issues, no huge code duplication in each device,
which does not want to mess with 32/64 ioctl issues, but 
want easy userspace control.

Later connector was changed a bit to allow easy notification
ability and new bus was added.
Connector is the solution for d-bus related projects, since
all control is in one place, there are destination ID,
there is no complex API.

Concider the latest xfrm event changes - good that we already
have netlink socket there, but in each sending function 
[there are at least three new]
we have all those skb_alloc, skb_put, NLMSG_* and so on which are
absolutely identical.
According to names and structures itself, they are too close
to what connector is for, and how it is implemented, so we already
have several connectors in the tree, and do we really want 
to proceed with it all over the place?
