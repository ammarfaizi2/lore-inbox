I'm CC'ing LMKL in hopes that this gets in the search engines so that I
quit getting 5 of these mails a day :)

The fix for the DFE-580tx in Linux is to either download the driver
from dlink's site (I don't have the exact URL, but you can find it if
you look.), or perhaps use Becker's latest driver from www.scyld.com.

I hear the kernel will be updated with a working driver very soon (maybe
it has already??)

Thanks,
Ben
