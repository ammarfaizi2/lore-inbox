Thanks Mel, your monographs looks extremely interesting.
I'll be reading them for weeks.

Is there a similar document for the rest of the 2.5/2.6 kernel;
something to supplement Bovet's & Cesati's book on understanding the
linux kernel. I'll finish my subscription to the LKDP mailing list.

I studied John Lion's UNIX commentary back and your
