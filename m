OK, sorry about that. My 486 router/web server is dying, and I've got
some heavy reformatting/replacement action pending next week. Here's an
alternative address for now:
	http://perso.crans.org/~chepelov/swsusp/

I've put the list on CC: too (I can't subscribe, otherwise I'll really
kill the 486 [die spammers die!] before its time has come, but I'll try
to follow through the archives).

Thanks in advance!
