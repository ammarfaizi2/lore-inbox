"ReiserFS V3 is the stablest Linux filesystem, and V4 is the fastest.

In regards to claims by ext2 that they are the de facto
standard Linux filesystem, the most polite thing to say is that
many persons disagree, and it is interesting that those persons
seem to include the distros that are growing in market share.
See http://www.namesys.com/benchmarks.html for why many disagree."

These statements seem inflammatory at best, and bloat an already large help=
