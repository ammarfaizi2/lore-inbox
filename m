You have been nominated by a friend to participate in our new initiative.

As of this year, we are allowing a select few individuals to obtain an Official Degree from one of ten respected Universities without ever opening a book or taking a test.

All we require is that you confirm your nomination on our secure site and we will ship the degree of your choice to you worldwide.
