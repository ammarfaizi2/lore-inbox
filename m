I would say kbuild-2.5 appears to be beta and getting ready for Linus 
submittal.

Eric Raymond's CML2 has little chance of getting in the kernel, when he 
has consistently ignored threads of discussion relating to CML2, 
specifically feedback from Linus, myself, and others...  If he updates 
his CML2 per feedback, _then_ I would consider it beta and ready for 
inclusion.  Otherwise it is IMO D.O.A.
