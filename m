Stupid follow-up question for you.  Is it possible for me to stay on 2.4.18, 
but test the 2.5.16 USB subsystem?  I really don't want to move my whole 
system to 2.5.16, but would be willing to experiment with the USB parts.  Is 
this possible?  Can I just rebuild the usb modules - I'm guessing this 
wouldn't work, but thought I would ask anyway.  Or to ask another way - any 
way us 2.4 folks can help?

Thanks much for your (all the USB developers) work on USB - it is great to 
have USB working under Linux, I do appreciate it.
