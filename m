of late CHIEF BENSON NMBEKE. I am 19 Years old, our father died about 2 
years ago on the 5th of April 2004, in a gold mine in MENDE, Republic 
of Serria Leone . He was into legal gold mining, he has succeeded in 
saving $18 millions dollars (eighteen million U.S. Dollars) during his 
Business on Gold, before he went on a trip to Republic of Cote D' 
Ivoire near by country to our country to save his money for security 
reasons because of the political problem in our country unfortunately 
he is dead and I will not want the money to be kept like that without 
any investment purpose, so I am contacting you with full trust that you 
will not let us down .

We need help from you to help us transfer this 
money to your country for investment and who will be sincere to invert 
us to his country with out cheating us or doing bad to us on my arrival

transfer of the money 
and 5% extra for any expense you incurs in this 
transaction, please mail us immediately urgent to know your stands 
before looking else where you're the first person we are contacting and 
also send your phone number as soon as possible to enable us to beat 
the said time.
