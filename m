They told me the same thing. That seems to be their standard tech support
answer for anything they can't handle ...

Anyone from ASUS reading this should take notice:

Having so much traffic going on on the LKML regarding the inability of
competent people to get your board to work is a major PR problem. As a
result of this, you are likely to have already lost dozens of potential
customers who may have been looking at this board, but as a result of
what they found from doing a google on "Linux and K8N-DL" have probably
decided to purchase another product instead.

And if no one from ASUS is reading this, then ASUS has got far more
serious problems than the previous paragraph hints.
