Hi all. I've been using kernel 2.4.21-rc3 for some time without
any problems since the day it was released.

Now that official 2.4.21 has been released I compiled it but
problems started.

Ok now, where is the problem. Well the screen seems to go
in standby after I run X, and I must reboot since
Alt+Ctrl+123456 doesn't work. I have the same problem when
I upgrade to the latest bios from Epox (I have an Epox 8RDA+
with nforce2 chipset and GeForce Ti4200) with kernel 2.4.21-rc3.

I patched the kernel 2.4.21 with ck1 patch for O(1) sched and
agpgart and so on. But I think the problem is not here since it
comes also with another BIOS and the working kernel.

Down here I report my dmesg and my kernel conf file. There are
no Xfree errors so I guess is not its fault too.

Thanks for your help.

I forgot... I use vesa framebuffer for console, and apm
(acpi gives me more errors like "Lost hdb interrupt").
My CPU is an Athlon Xp 2000+ core Palomino.
