Well, there's indeed a meaning behind it, apart from "fucked over and over 
beyond all repair."

Firstly, there was foo, way back when in the 1930s when I was a bit 
younger. Its meaning was not always technical, I think it came from some 
kind of comic strip, but I'm not sure.

It became a buzzword soon, it was used all over. Then came up the 
technicians. Remembering the german word "furchtbar" (meaning "terrible", 
actually) they introduced the term fubar, fucked up beyond all repair. It 
later transformed to the well-known foobar. Actually, think of foobar as a 
foo with a bar over it - foo inverted.

Later it was used in its current meaning by e.g. dec in their decsys 
manuals, go read it if you like, I don't have them handy.
