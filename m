That's "Linux Conference, Australia" or the acronym comes out wrong :-)

I don't think it would be out of order at all.
Are you an Adelaide local?  Are you offering to organise?

One must wonder, though, if we take too many topics into special
mini-conferences, what will be left for the main conference??

I understand that Perth LCA had many more submissions than they could
accept.  Possibly a kernel mini-conf could give opportunities to some
of the kernel-oriented speakers who aren't accepted for the main
conference...
