I included all that dmesg gave me. syslog logs to another host and this
has the following addditional lines in its log file just before the "Bad
page state in process 'swapper'" messages:

	Nov 10 09:29:41 192.168.1.120 kernel: No module symbols loaded - kernel mo=
dules not enabled. =20
	Nov 10 09:29:41 192.168.1.120 kernel: mapcount:1 count:0=20
	Nov 10 09:29:41 192.168.1.120 kernel: Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is=
 needed=20

Nothing about a e820 map though.

yes. 2.6.17.x and 2.6.18.x all worked with no problems.

See below.

OK I will try this. Can't promise if I will be able to do so today, as I
have to wait until the currently running jobs are finished.

Thanks
