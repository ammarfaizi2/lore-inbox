> Am I missing something or the patch is really broken?

I don't think it is broken, there are many people who did succeed in building 
without reporting broken patches. I use "patch" version 2.5.4, Rik's 
bitkeeper diff's did always work for me. Maybe you should upgrade to a newer 
version of patch.

Thank you and good luck

Jörg
