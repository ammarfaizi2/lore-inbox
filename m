Hi

I am browsing linux TCP MIB header code and I see many fields but no
explanation on what those fields are.

Some of them are obvious but others are not.

you can see all of them by typing

/proc/net/netstat

Does anyone know about what these fields contain? Is it documented anywhere?

I did a google but could not find anything.

Thanks

Arcot
