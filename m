Are there any plans for including support for the ATI Rage 128 chipset into 
svgalib?
The VESA setting does not work. Causes any program using svgalib to crash.
Are there any configuration settings in the kernel that may help with this?

The kernel I am using is 2.4.4 and the card I am using is the Rage Fury (32 
MB).
The svgalib version is 1.4.2
Framebuffer does have support for Rage 128, so I don't see why svgalib doesn't.

Thanks!
