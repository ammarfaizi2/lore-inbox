Hello all,

Attached is my .config.

Below is output of build process, edited for brevity.

The build fails with an undefined reference to "ide_setup_dma()".

Note in .config that IDE bus support is not selected, build is for machine with
pci bus system and a pci-based scsi controller and drive.

Using gcc 3.3.1 20030722 (Debian prerelease).  Distribution is Debian unstable,
all software dev tools are current.

Hope this helps, let me know if more info needed.
