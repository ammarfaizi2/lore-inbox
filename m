Tested oldconfig, menuconfig, xconfig - all give the same results now.
Even better, the change means that the CML2 output is now much closer
to the config generated by CML1.  There are some minor differences
between CML1 and CML2 generated configs but those could be due to
better validation in CML2, I will follow those up in a separate mail.
Looking good.
