Your definition of "services" is far too narrow. Requirements change 
with time; ideal software today may be inadequate tomorrow. I make most 
of my money from customizing software to a specific customer's needs. I 
combine and refine existing components to produce unique software.

A case in point: My Java Indexed Serialization Package (JISP) provides a 
very basic tool; about half my business comes from people who like the 
Jisp concept, and need a custom version that is tightly coupled to their 
requirements. I don't sell Jisp; I sell *what I can do* with Jisp.
