I can see what you mean. Personally, neither do I expect a problem. And if
it did become a problem, I wouldn't care very much. If I knew that someone
stole my work and took credit for it, I would flame him somewhere public,
just to let the world know, but it wouldn't keep me up at night.

But there is another view at this problem. When money gets involved. If
someone is stealing your code and is making money of it. Most people I
know would react in a very offensive way. But I wouldn't. I did never
expect to get any money out of it, so well. ;)

Or.. Err. On the second thought, I would flame them too, I guess. Darn.

We will just have to be pedagogical. We'll have to try to help them
overcome their fear of those pirates, as you said. I think that it might
be enough for some people to raise the question "Does it really matter? At
least _you_ know you did this."
