Yes, if you want to answer directly and via mailing-list.
If you want to send only to the list, you just have to edit the To: and
Cc: field.
Alternatively you could implement a "Reply-List" Button or similar
feature into Thunderbird (or any other MUA you prefer) instead of
loading *your* work and problems onto lots of other people.

Sorry, but the writing the original senders name with the lists address
into any header field is insane and totally unacceptable.
