Hi Linus,

I just ran across this song, recorded by Lyle Lovett.  As you can see, he really
likes penguins.  If you'd like to hear the song, I'd be glad to send you a tape.

Best Wishes,
Adam

Album: I Love Everybody
Title: Penguins

I go for Penguins
I don't go for fancy cars
For diamond rings
Or movie stars
I go for penguins
Oh Lord I go for penguins

Throw your money out the door
We'll just sit around
And watch it snow
I go for penguins
Oh Lord I go for penguins

Penguins are so sensitive
Penguins are so sensitive
Penguins are so sensitive
To my needs
To my needs
To my needs
To my needs
--Lyle Lovett
