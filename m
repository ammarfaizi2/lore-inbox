In the US, the law (17 USC 106) is very clear that renting, lending,
and leasing are "distribution" that is a protected right.  The Berne
Convention says the same in article 11bis (remember that a later
revision explicitly included computer programs in "literary works").
Do you think this interpretation of "distribution" does not apply to
Free?  If not, why not?
