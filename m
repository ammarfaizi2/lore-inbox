First, there are cheap "tell-tale" indicators which can be attached to the
contents of the container where you can see them as soon as you open the
package. That the vendors ship without them tells you they have found that
it's cheaper to eat a few DOA units than spend even a few cents on proof.

Second, having attached such a device to an old hard drive and repacked
it, I dropped it from eye level (about two meters) on a hardwoord floor.
The 5G triggered, the 20G didn't. Many drives will take 20G power off, so
you really need to beat on the package to do harm. Tossing it into a truck
or dropping it a foot onto a conveyor belt is unlikely to cause damage.
Yes, anything is possible.

Finally, I have returned a number of drives, and at least WD has just
asked for the serial number so they could check the build date. I'm told
Seagate is also good on that, asking only about power surges, etc. Someone
else always seems to deal with that, so that's lack of complaint, not
experience.
