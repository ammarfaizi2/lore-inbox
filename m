So, what feature are you trying to smuggle into the kernel
but are afraid isn't ready on time and why do you think it
couldn't be backported into 2.6 later, when 2.6 is stable ?

I can't really think of anything that couldn't be backported
later on, by the time people start actually using 2.6, but
maybe you've got something so fundamental it just has to be
merged before the feature freeze ... ;)

regards,

Rik
