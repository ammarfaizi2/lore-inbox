Hey everyone,

I cannot get alsa-driver to compile whatsoever with 2.6.18.  I've been
trying to find the solution on Alsa-Users for two weeks no and haven't
gotten an answer.  So I was hoping that someone on LKML has gotten
alsa-driver to compile with 2.6.18.  I cannot get the stable or the
pre-release to compile.  The errors I get are:

I'd greatly appreciate any help.

Thanks!
George
