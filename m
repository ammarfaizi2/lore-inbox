And MS  Word allows to  export data in  plain text or html.   But it's
still allowed to  reverse MS Word to make  a .doc import/export plugin
for OpenOffice or Abiword.

This is  exactly the  same. As  long as there  is a  data format  or a
protocol involved,  European laws allow users to  reverse engineer it,
to  be  able to  create  another program  using  the  same format  and
protocols. 

All data formats and protocol  should be publically available. This is
absolute required for  a full inter-operability, and to  give to users
the freedom of  choice. If they are not,  then European laws guarantee
us that we are free to try to find out by ourselves. And I'm glad this
law exists.
