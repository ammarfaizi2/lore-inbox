As others have told already, this is the ECN problem.

You have a list?  Send all of them a message stating that they ought
to upgrade their firewalls which cause this problem.  Or they
will loose customers/visitors.  Cisco already have an upgrade for them,
so fixing is dead easy, and they can then boast compatibility with
the latest internet standards.  

If they don't care about linux users, tell them that windows eventually
will use ECN too.  They definitely don't want to have a ECN problem when
that happens.
