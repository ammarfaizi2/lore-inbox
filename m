I copied automount binary to another box, which has mount in /bin while old
one had mount also in /usr/bin (and automount had /usr/bin/mount hardcoded),
I was puzzled how come it does not find mount?! I heeded to to do weird things
to compile in correct paths.

Can we stick to standard method of using $PATH? Please, pretty please.
