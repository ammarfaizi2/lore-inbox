Could those that were involved in the VIA chipset discussion email me
privately at pgpkeys@hislinuxbox.com?

I'm truly interested in solving this issue. I personally think it's more
than just the chipset causing the problems.


I'm looking for members of the list that are using the kernel support for
the following


VIA chipset
Promise controller (PDC2026# with specifics on the PDC20265 (ATA100))
SMP support
IDE + SCSI mix in the system.


I'm trying to track a number of POSSIBLE bugs (can't say they are for
sure) and any input from folks with this mix of drivers would be
exponentially useful, even if for nothing more than discounting some of my
thoughts.


Also, can anyone summurize the already known and specific problems with
combinations of the above requirements? I would truly appreciate that.
