I am one of those readers that don't post, well to now. I don't want to make 
a fool out of myself, plus nothing yet has really piqued my interest and I 
never went to University to do CS or CE, played too much Rugby instead (but I 
want to go sometime perhaps), so my prgramming really is not up to scratch 
yet. Perhaps this is reflected on others too. Not above beta testing of 
course.

Whining occurs pretty much everywhere, not just here. As this is an open and 
free development perhaps people feel free to be a little less professional in 
their words, rather than just reporting facts. Linus seems to be very Hobbit 
like, very humble indeed. Only Linus probably knows why it does not seem to 
get him down.

Nope, they may let you freeze instead. Happy Christmas  and New Year to 
everyone, may 2002 be very much more successful than 2001. 2001 was probably 
jinxed due to Arthur C Clark anyway...
