I can't believe nobody talks about TiVO and what they're doing (only
allowing signed Linux kernels to boot on their machines).

That is DRM, and directly in response to open source.

Yet at the same time I recognize the truth in Linus's stance here.
And personally, I'm going to speak with my walet by not buying any
products from those fucknuts at TIVO.  This is precisely the mechanism
Linus said would decide if DRM is successful or not.
