I too have a shuttle SN41G2 barebone system with the FN41 mainboard. I
added a XP3000+, 2x 512MB Corsair memory and a 200GB Maxtor. It has
always been stable running 2.5/2.6 24/7 at maximum cpu load
(folding@home).

I love the system for it's intelligent cpu cooling system which takes
heat generated by the cpu out immediately. CPU runs between 40 and 50
degrees Celcius (at max cpu load). It is noisy though, and the fan speed
regulator is stupid which makes the noise annoying when the cpu is
alternating between 39 and 40 degrees (at 16 degrees room temperature,
so for example at night when you try to sleep) and the fan changes it's
speed all the time (speed is stable above 40 degrees, and these values
are adjustable in the bios).

The case looks nice too and is conveniently small. I didn't dare to put
more than the 200GB disk in to make sure it can get rid of it's heat
(now running between 25 and 35 degrees C.). The rest is external.

I've never read the Shuttle boards where unstable. I thought people had
problems with the normal size boards from Asus and others.

Kind regards, Sander
