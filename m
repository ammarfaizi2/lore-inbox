I think a judge could rule on almost anything, almost any way. Some judges 
seem to have less sense than a well-trained rabbit (see the lawsuit about 
"The Wind Done Gone", where at least one judge blocked it.

Judges are just people, after all.

So yes, clarifications are good. No question about that. There's a reason 
I added mine. Just to tell everybody else, and to make sure there's as 
little gray area in that place as humanly possible.

So I'm not saying that "v2 only" language is _bad_. I'm just saying that 
it shouldn't matter. It's technically enough to just say "GPLv2", and you 
don't really have to say anything else.
