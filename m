Please will you move those boring threads to another mailing list or
even to usenet ? This is LKML, we're only the 6th of the month and
there are already 1250 messages, 200 of which come from this thread,
and many others coming from other long off-topic threads. 20% noise
is too high and disturbting. It becomes difficult to find someone
talking about subjects related to kernel development !

Thanks in advance
Willy
