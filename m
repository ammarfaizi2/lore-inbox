I would like to know whether log replays take place whenever the system is 
booted or only after it has been incorrectly shutdown. I occasionaly see 
"Warning, log replay (...)" during the boot-up sequence although the system 
had been correctly shut down, and I would like to know if I should worry.

Thank you

Mack Stevenson
