To be fair, I use it, but I haven't read much of it.  I mostly read the
whitepaper, and then read it again, several times, to make sure I groked
it.  Then I read the Future Vision paper, once, and completely failed to
understand it.  Now that I understand Spotlight, I might go back to it.

This is why I stay out of the deeply technical stuff, and frequently
insist that I don't know what I'm doing and don't work here.

The social traditions aren't uniform.  In fact, if we're referring to
all of open source, go hang out on irc.freenode.net#gentoo for a great
community, whether or not you like the distro.  If you want developers,
there's not too many RTFM's and "I was coding bytecode engines when you
were in dipers" attitudes in #perl, either.
