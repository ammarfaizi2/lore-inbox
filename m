I've been wondering about this too, but I was afraid to ask first :-)

When 2.6 is officially released as a stable kernel and 2.4 is relegated to security/
bugfix-only status, what will happen to 2.0 and 2.2? Obviously, they won't be
totally ignored for support reasons (not everyone uses 2.4 - see counter.li.org),
but what will Mr. Anvin do to the frontpage of kernel.org?
