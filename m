Look, Alan and anyone else, I'm sort of sick of the flames about BK.
It's apparent that there will always be people who are looking for
excuses to attack BK because it isn't GPLed and how dare the kernel
hackers use it.  Your mail was so senseless that that was the only sane
explanation I could find and apparently I wasn't being paranoid, that's
what John thought as well.

I have a bad habit of taking things personally and too seriously and
the result is that attacks on me/BK/whatever, imagined or real, stress
me out and waste my time.  Life's too short to for me to deal with that
nonsense anymore.  I discovered procmail and I dump people into a spam
file if I feel they have a track record of yanking my chain.  It's my
fault that I'm such a wuss that I can't handle it but this works.
It's not personal, it's about having a more pleasant life and I find
things to be more pleasant without the flames.

I'll still read your mail, I do so about every 2 weeks, but that way 
whatever yankage you were (or were not) trying to do is in the past and
I'll ignore it.
