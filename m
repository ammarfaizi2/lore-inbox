	I already addressed this. There is no way to use source code other 
than to create derivative works.

	Please, explain to me how you use a header file other than to create 
derivative works. Explain to me how you use the gcc source code other 
than to compile it into a derivative work. For source code, there is 
no distinction between use and the creation of derivative works. 

	Source code is a recipe. You use it to create some form of end 
product, which is a derivative work. You can't have the right to use 
a recipe without the right to produce and eat whatever the recipe is 
for.

	As I already explained, you don't need this clause to give you the 
right to distribute modified works because this right is the simple 
sum of rights you already have.

	You already have the right to produce derivative works. You already 
have the right to distribute the original work. You already have the 
right to distribute the modifications. Your recipient already has the 
right to use and possess the original. There is no additional right 
to the original work for this section to give you. The right it seeks 
to give you is the simple sum of rights you already have.

	"Distributing derived works" is not a specific right under any 
copyright law I know of. It's the sum of other rights. You need some 
rights to the original and some rights to the derivation. I'm saying 
you already have all the rights to the original you need without 
section 2.
