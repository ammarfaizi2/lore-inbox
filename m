I agree, but the fact is that the emu10k* devices own the Windows gamer
market and like it or not these devices will sell millions of units, and
they've worked perfectly in Linux for years.  So these users have a
reasonable expectation that Creative will provide them an upgrade path,
just like they did for SBLive! -> Audigy1 and Audigy1 -> Audigy2.

I'm not trying to pick a fight with Creative, but regardless of what I
(or any Linux developer) does, there's going to be a fight if they try
to lock out Linux users.
