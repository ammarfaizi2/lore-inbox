As a journalist I would also say that you shouldn't use IRC for the 
interview medium.  I once tried to do an interview using the "talk" 
facility on CompuServe and capture the conversation to floppy disk.  (Easy 
for me to do with Professional YAM.)  I ended up repeating the interview in 
electronic mail because when I fact-checked the interview it turned out 
that the guy didn't stick to the same story throughout the interview.  The 
e-mail interview was much more coherent.

Some people just don't think well on their feet.  Some reporters try to 
take advantage of it.
