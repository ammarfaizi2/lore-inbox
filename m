Henning,

When you begin to learn that OpenSource is the way and that some of us
will work with companies on an as needed bases.  At this point if you came
to me I would put you through the same grinder that I do every other use
of the ATA/ATAPI subsystem for commerial purpose.  I have the duty and
right to protect that which was entrusted to me and that which I create.
If you do not like that rule, LEAVE!  Henning, if I catch you abusing the
privildge of use of my work, I will pursue you in terms defined as
actionable.  It is not a game.

Henning,

And you do not have the knowledge or authority to comment on this subject
where "I do".  Maybe it you would bother the take you shoe out of your
mouth one more time than you put it in you could not sound more like a
fool, today.

TiVO came to Linux and Linux went back to TiVO in a working relationship.

The 2.3-based tree is not in a releaseable state at his point, and
doesn't have the AV stuff in it yet, anyway.  The 2.1-based code (which
is what our shipping units currently use) is available, I can inquire
into the release mechanism for that if you're interested.

Once Linux decides to adopt and support AV Streams, it will be in the best
interrest of TiVO to work with me so that they do not have to work against
me.  This is how you work with industry.  You load share the work.
