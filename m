Greg's comment states what is already stated by the GPL. It might not suit
your personal desire, but thats tough. The matter is one of "linking" - in
a legal not a technical sense and of what is and is not a derivative
work. If your code is a derivative work of GPL code then the GPL is
totally clear on the matter.
