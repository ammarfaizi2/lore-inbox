The testing isn't minimal - it is merely ongoing.  Users don't
pay for the kernel, so they are part of the testing team.

If you use anything but a distribution kernel, keep previous
kernels around when you upgrade.  If the new one fails, report
it here and go back to the previous one.  The only way to get wide
testing is when enough people do this.
