Does it matter who collects the money? It should only be based on
convenience. And it's much easier/safer/efficient to have the OEM
collect the funds than any other party.

Imagine going to a store and asking "Two Sony Vaio laptops please, and
make them OSS, NOT Windows" and beign charged the computer's quoted
price (or maybe even less, but never more). Imagine not having to
research on how to get a refund for that Windows license that came
bundled and that you don't need. Imagine not having to _require_ the OEM
to preinstall any OSS on the machine for it to "OSS ready" (unless you
ask for redhat/suse/etc), yet beign able to use any OSS without having
to pay any extra dime.

There's this ilusion in normal people's minds that Windows is free
because it comes with the computer. We should take advantage of that
fact. And anyone that claims OSS is free is having an ilusion for OSS
costs money to develop and to be able to use OSS you need to spend a lot
of money (even if you don't pay anything back to the OSS developers).

Small note: funding OSS is not about the money. The money here is a
medium (funds) for an end (free software). Only businesses invert the
relation and put money as the objective objective and turn work into a
medium.

Here's a clear version of what I meant: Limited ability to "allocate the
money paid" based on what they'd like to be improved.

Whatever they decide is fine for me as it's their show and not mine. You
and Larry can think differently, as you are involved in developement.
