(I'm quite sure this is off-topic, but oh well :-/ )

I want to make a note about something that concerns me, and I haven't 
really seen discussed much..

BK is quite nice, and from it's design, could probably scale to haveing 
every linux developer on the planet using the same 'base' linux kernel 
tree with no problem. (Please don't argue with this point, it's not what 
I'm concerned about)

However, the real problem I see is that althought Bitkeeper (the product)  
scales very well, Bitmover (the company) does NOT. Bitmover needs income 
to scale, and I'm worried that if BK takes off for kernel development, 
the demands on Bitmover from kernel developers will far outstrip the 
increase in income they get from 'commercial' developers. If this happens, 
it's only going to end in everyone getting pissed off. 

I can't think of any 'win/win' solutions for this, problem only 
'lose/lose' ones. Is anyone else worried about this, or am I just a 
pessimist?
