I found two old CDs which contents is partially Linux. :-)

In particular they contain what seems like a complete archive of
linux-activists list starting from November 1991 up to digest 988,
Volume #4 from "Wed, 28 Apr 93".  Here is an opening message earlier
from what Ted quoted himself. :-)

  [0001] tytso@ATHENA.MIT.EDU  Linux_Activists  11/07/91 13:08 (4 lines)
  Subject: Reason for this meeting
  Linux_activists is a discuss archive of the mailing list about Linux,
  a free unix-like kernel for 386-AT computers, coming with full source
  code. It is meant for hackers/computer science students to use, learn
  and enjoy.

These disks also include SLS 99 p2 and SLS 1.01 distributions by Peter
MacDonald <pmacdona@sanjuan.uvic.ca>.  In particular the following
library sources are included:

     47382 Feb 16  1993 libc-4.2-4.3.tar.z
    707527 Feb 16  1993 libc-4.3.tar.z
      9956 Feb 19  1993 libm-4.0.tar.z
    219711 Mar  1  1993 libg++-2.3.tar.z
    158383 Apr  4  1993 libc-4.3.2-4.3.3.tar.z
    843872 Apr  4  1993 libc-4.3.3.tar.z

(no 4.4, I am afraid) and these Linux kernels:

    850885 Dec 13  1992 linux-0.99.tar.Z
     47199 Dec 22  1992 linux-0.99.patch1.Z
     37226 Jan  2  1993 linux-0.99.patch2.Z
    117007 Jan 13  1993 linux-0.99.patch3.Z
     16845 Jan 22  1993 linux-0.99.patch4.Z
     94209 Feb  9  1993 linux-0.99.patch5.Z
     65359 Feb 23  1993 linux-0.99.patch6.Z
    906678 Feb 23  1993 linux-0.99.6.tar.Z
    114894 Mar 13  1993 linux-0.99.patch7.z
    625942 Apr  9  1993 linux-0.99.8.tar.z
     77658 Apr  9  1993 linux-0.99.patch8.z
     70858 Apr 23  1993 linux-0.99.patch9.z
    636243 Apr 23  1993 linux-0.99.9.tar.z

So what of this will be of interest and to whom?
