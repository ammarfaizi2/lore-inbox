Roman forgets that he doesn't speak for everyone, he makes statements like
"the GPL is all about ..." as if he was elected the leader of the free
software world and everyone agrees with him.  Some people people agree with
him but a lot of people don't.  Unfortunately, in these sorts of discussions,
the sane people tend to stay out of it and the fruitcakes come crawling out
of the woodwork to tell you that you are doing it wrong and that you just
don't get it.

Your procmail may set ye free, just use it.
