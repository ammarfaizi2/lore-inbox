You cannot ENFORCE the license, but you could have certainly sent them
a polite message, drawing their attention to the matter.  It could
have been a simple mistake, but you don't know, because you decided to
"send a precise report to the copyright holders" by sending a message
to a widely-read mailing list.  This is very different to sending a
message to the FSF, who will typically begin by sending a polite
e-mail.
