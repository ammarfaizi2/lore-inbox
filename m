Hello,

Please note I am not on the kernel mailing list so I would appreciate
being copied in on any reply made.

Can someone advise me if the "Make several vm behaviours tunable for
now" as of the 2.4.9-ac4 patch are implemented in the kernel .config
file?  If so is there an easy way to carry forward a 2.4.8 version of
the .config file using "make xconfig" so that I do not have to set
all the setting I have made from scratch?  I get the sense from the
Kernel documentation that one can run a process that will ask one
only those parameters that have been changed or added rather that all
of them, but best I can tell this is a console y/n/?? type response.


Regards,
