Sean,
   You might get a laugh out of this! It's a reply from ASUS about the
motherboard (this was 2 days b4 they released the 1004.7 BETA BIOS.

Pretty sad when ASUS tells you to "Clear your CMOS". I thought I asked a
pretty straightforward tech question... Makes me wonder if they even read
it, or they had a PERL script do it!

Ps. New BIOS didn't change a thing. The PCI Device names in the ACPI table
are not entered in a fashion that the kernel recognizes. Maybe ASUS decided
to 'optimize' routing by making a more efficient table?' nah..

Cheers,

-Brian

Dear Sir/Madam,


Thank you for your support for our products!

Please start by clearing the system c-mos memory following the procedure in
your manual. Make sure the power AND the battery on the motherboard is
removed before shorting the CLR RTC solder points or jumper pins. Short the
pins for at least 20-30 seconds.


If this is still not working, you can have your old BIOS chip reprogrammed
or order a new, reprogrammed chip from! us.

********************************** IMPORTANT
************************************************
****************************************************************************
*******************
Please refer to your manual to locate the BIOS chip on your motherboard. If
the chip is removable, it will be fitted into a socket. Please be careful
when removing the chip--do not damage the socket or the chip. Make sure you
remove the chip from the socket, but DO NOT remove the socket from the
motherboard.
