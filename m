Do you know the conditions for a pyramid scheme? A piramid scheme starts
when a guy can convince some (more than 1) other guys to pay him a
certain amount, with the promise that they will be able to do just the
same sale to other people. Of course, at some point the system stops
working as everyone knows (easy math, no 101 needed).

The fGPL scheme means you pay $10, and you get code in exchange. The
developer receiving the funds either buys food, a computer, a book, or
maybe even uses it for a nice trip with his/her family after their hard
work is done. Let me know when you find the pyramid!

You can be agressive all that you want, but it doesn't look good when
you are making a fool of youself. Millions of people like me are free
riding your hard work. Dump my idea, laugh at it, hate me for being so
stupid...we couldn't care less :)

PD: I do know you are one of the most talented people around, and I
couldn't thank you enough for the hard work you do everyday. But that
doesn't mean you are always right. Sorry.
