Apologies, for asking this, but Google returns zip in
relation to this, and I thought there might be some issue
that is known about to make this board work reliably.

It's a Aptron P4VXAD, trying to install Redhat 8.0, with
a 2.4 GHZ P4. I've swapped CD/HD several times, all fail,
there are no specific error's but the installer just can't
find random packages. I've tried adding "apm=off, apic=off,
and acpi=off" to the kernel parameters just to see if it
helped, nothing.

I'm desperate, any ideas are very much appreciated.
