So, rather than repeated ask questions of the form:

	How do I change X (a 2.2 thingy in my driver) to the blessed
	form on 2.4.x?

I'm wondering if there's a driver in the kernel tree that somebody can
point to and say, "This is how drivers should be done."  In
particular, I'm interested in networking drivers but any non-trivial
driver will do.
