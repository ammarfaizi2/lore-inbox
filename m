It seems I was also put on moderation just after the message
that they opened up the list.

Either they're not telling us the truth, or they don't know
how to handle their mailer setup. I don't particularly care
which, because with both possible reasons I've pretty much
lost trust in their ability to handle Linux LVM development.

Well, no, I've lost it a long time ago after Andreas' patches
got dropped over and over again and comments on the LVM code
got refused by the moderators at Sistina ...

regards,

Rik
