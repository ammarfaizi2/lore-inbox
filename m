Well, a language which is known by you :) And you should write some
boot loader or something. Imho every beginnger programmer is planning
to write an OS. I did a simple OS too (assembly, nasm). It's quite interesting
task, but it doesn't worth: your OS may be not supported by any others than
you :) [well, for contrast: every OS can begin in this way though]
