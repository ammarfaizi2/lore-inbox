Hi,

Did you know?
You can now get $347,000 for as little as $607 a month!
Why should you pay more when you can save thousands re-financing at our low rates?
Remember, that rates are due to jump withint he next few months.
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what!

Use the extra for home additions, improvements, or whatever you could not afford to do before.
Fill out this 30 sec. form and be approved within the next 24 hours.
