Well, yes. I want my hardware to work properly. And, given amount of problems with my current setup and _knowing_ 
how much time it will take for me to debug them by myself , I'm deciding that in the end run it will be faster and more efficent to
pay relevant people to fix bugs in subsystems they write/maintain than to participate in (sometimes) never ending bugfix mode.

Well. Regarding myself, your assumptions are totally wrong. 
My Linux experience started in 1995, as an admin/coder, and since 2000 I'm Linux-only almost 100% 
And up to some point I was fixing bugs that were critical for me in kernels I was using. 
But now, given amount of other tasks before me (my regular daily/nightly job) , to spend a few weeks to
understand why my WiFi starts to drop packets after resume is more than I could afford.
