There is a logic fallacy here, Samuel. Absence of source not preventing
theft has nothing to do with the level and kind of theft if the source
is placed out there for competitors to steal. When the hardware playing
field is more or less even and the OS playing field is more or less even
the only particular value added for games or for small marketplace code
comes from wringing superior performance out of the provided components.
When I place a piece of software out for purchase that features a new
innovation in the use of a given hardware platform my competitors look
it over intently, "How'd she do that?" I am pretty sure they can figure
it out quickly enough. But, I still have a 3 to 6 month lead time to pay
for the roof over my head before the competitors are selling the same
feature. If I give then my source code that lead time goes away and I
am left flipping burgers to pay for a coding habit. Trust me, it ain't
going to go down that way. If a benefactor cares to pay for my
innovations and release them with source immediately then I am willing
to play the game. I am not after world domination. I just want to pay
for my food and housing and some hobbies so that my life is worth
living. I'm just not willing to give away what should be creating a
life for me. That way of living is an exotic form of suicide. As a
software consultant my income is getting paid for my work. If I release
that code to the public immediately it is ready for release I don't
have an income. Both my stomach and the IRS get disappointed. The
latter I can happily deal with. The former is more bother than I can
handle.
