I've had this pointed out to me by about five people now.  Apparently there's 
more to emacs than I thought...  (Considering its kitchen sink icon, this 
should come as a suprise to no one...)

Thanks for the link.  I've also been pointed to xemacs.org.  Have to check 
out both next time I plug this laptop in to the net.  (And I apparently need 
to set up a mailing list on this, since the number of people asking me to do 
so has now hit double digits...)

I'll post a thing here when I do that so we can move at least most of this 
discussion off linux-kernel.

I sort of know about gosling's version.  (It's mentioned in Stallman's 
history of emacs on gnu.org...)  Interesting how the same people keep popping 
up as you move from topic to topic.  (Licklidder wasn't just a bigwig behind 
arpanet, he also kicked off project mac at MIT.  Doug McIllroy who was one of 
the half-dozen figures behind the unix launch at bell labs came to BTL after 
working on project whirlwind at Lincoln Labs (I.E. MIT.)  And of course Ken 
Olsen, hotshot at whirlwind behind core memory, creator of the memory test 
computer that (when donated to marvin minsky's computing lab) virtually 
created the whole "Hacker" phenomenon, whose wrote a paper as a graduate 
student suggesting the use of transistors in computers which convinced IBM to 
build the first fully transistorized computer (I -THINK-, timeline still a 
bit fuzzy there to  claim "first", may just have been first commercially 
shipping one), and then of course went off to found Digital after tx-0...

Hmmm...  I should probably corner Alan Cox at some event and ask him about 
his Amiga days.  (And I DID track down Commodore guru Jim Butterfield last 
year, he was living in Canada at the time.  Just got back into computing 
after years with cataracts obstructing his vision, apparently...)
