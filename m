If you have a specific problem, describe it, and linux kernel 
maintainers and SuSE would be glad to help you.

But this kind of whiny rant only serves to make "4Front Technologies" 
look like a bunch of unprofessional dorks.  It's one thing for some 
13-year-old script kiddy to act like a baby, but it really looks bad 
when the representative of a company acts like this.
