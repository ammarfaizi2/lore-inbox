It depends on the NDA. Lots of vendors NDA their docs because they give enough
info to cloen the hardware, or explain how to fab the chip, or include personal
details of employees .. and a million other reasons. Many sensible, many quite
daft.

But in my experience you have a better chance of getting a straight answer out
of a politician than intels networking folks. Maybe they have reformed
