You would be for example surprised to see how complex the software  
controlling the breaks
of a reasonable modern car turns out to be... This is just a  
technical example running contrary
to your "wisdom". In numerical computations you can find reasonable  
amounts of software
which is precisely just that - bug free. There are mathematical  
proofs running for hundreds of pages,
which are just valid. Do you think this kind of guys doesn't ever sit  
down and write
some piece of software to help out well for example in determining  
some aerodynamics of a plane?
Are you assuming this kind of applications is trivial and by virtue  
of a natural law bug ridden?

And by the way: the zero program which has nothing to do is bug free.  
QED.
