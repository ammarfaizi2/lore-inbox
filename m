   The development criteria used to be technically based, and that is still
   the public statement.  Now, as your statement makes clear, working code
   is an irrelevant criteria.

No, working code is only part of the equation.  If you're a total and
complete asshole, your work is likely to get lost to the sands of
time.  In such a case nobody wants to deal with you.

Welcome to the real world where you have to interact with other human
beings (not just be technically capable) in order to accomplish
things.

It's always been like this Donald.  If you piss off, or are a jerk to,
the primary maintainers you're going to get the short end of the
stick.
