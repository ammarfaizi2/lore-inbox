I tested:
2.4.19-pre6 -> boots with mem=512M parameter
2.4.19-pre7 -> didn't boot at all
2.4.19-pre7 with arch/i386/kernel/setup.c from 2.4.19-pre6 -> boots with
mem=512M parameter

RedHat beta "NULL" didn't boot at all

For me it really seams that I have the same problem Justin has with his
i845G chipset board.
