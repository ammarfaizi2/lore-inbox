 Agreed.  And I suggest anyone doing such a study investigate all
 the different parts of bitkeeper, not just its file-management /
 distributed repository features.

 Little things make a lot of difference. Things like per-file
 comments on checkins instead of a single per-checking comment.
 And ease of use for some really mundane merge-tasks (See my earlier
 mail in this thread for details)

 It's only through actual usage patterns that you'll see all the
 neat time-saving gizmo's in there.
