	I just verified this particular aspect of VGER's MTA
	configurations.  It has been unmodified since 21-Mar-2000,
	that is, over a year...

	If e.g. Rik's ISP has added their dialup pools to DUL registry,
	that might be the reason behind the change.

	Well, comparing how much spam goes thru linux-mm vs. linux-kernel,
	I would say our methods are fairly effective.

	The incentive behind the DUL is to force users not to post
	straight out to the world, but to use their ISP's servers
	for outbound email --- normal M$ users do that, after all.
	Only spammers - and UNIX powerusers - want to post directly
	to the world from dialups.  And UNIX powerusers should know
	better, and be able to use ISP relay service anyway.
