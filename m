I do not understand this 
"i saw it - yuck! - and now i want to kill it "
point of view.
As I tried to point out. Things evolve. And
the evolution has the right do things wrong.
Next evolution step will do it probably better.

Al same as kernel development.  With your attitude
i'd have dropped linux 0.99 immediatly.
Remember the code in certain parts?

So what is your point?
I accept only  shiny little masterpieces of software?
Thats not the way it works IMHO.

Best Regards
Dietmar
