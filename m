Hello World,

I'm about to buy a new computer and the ASUS P5GD1 mainboard looks good
for me. My questions:

It has the Intel 915P chipset. Does it work with the current Linux
kernel?

It has also SATA with ICH6R chiptset. The SATA Linux status report page
says: " "looks like ICH5" support available in ata_piix ". What does
that mean? Does it work or not?

It has also PCI Express slots. Is there any support needed from the
software or is this a hardware thing and works out of the box?

Thanks in advance and best regards
	Andreas
