I think that there is lots to be said about moving out of silicon valley,
I personally don't like it here that all much.  On the other hand,
it is extremely cool that there is such a high concentration of smart
people within 30 minutes of my house.  What I'd like to see is a migration
out of silly valley but to somewhere else.  I.e., pockets of smart people
working together.  Face time with smart people is fun, if you get a chance
to do it, you know what I mean.
