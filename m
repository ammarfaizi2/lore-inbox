As I said, calculated risk.
I suppose if it was in a truely horrible state and the company wasn't a
large company such as IBM or HP that could probably afford to take the risk,
I could understand them being unwilling to release the source and spec
sheets.
Double edged swords run rampant in the computer industry... *sigh*

My dream is probably quite similar to that of every geek on earth... open,
standard protocols and API's for *everything* that allows for quick and easy
driver and software development, another layer if you will, but getting
hundreds of companies that tend to be addicted to closed everything to agree
on the standards would probably be next to impossible... prehaps it's time
some thought went into how to make this a reality, or are large scale
efforts for this already going on that I haven't noticed?
