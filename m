Al,

You mentioned a long time ago that the fs union changes
would not go into 2.4 because they required VFS API changes.
Will those API changes, if not the implementation, be merged
before the next stable release?

You are obviously very busy elsewhere in the tree, but I'd hate to
see this slip through the cracks ...

Regards,

	Bill Rugolsky
