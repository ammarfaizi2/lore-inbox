I've been the kjt patchset maintainer since mai/2004 and now
I'm happy to present you the new kernel-janitors maintainer:

Domen Puncer <domen@coderock.org>

"All of you (us) please keep up the janitors work, including helping
each other with patch reviews.  Otherwise the patches can easily
become too much for one person to handle, along with other duties."
Randy (former kj maintainer)

Couldn't say it better in my own words. Anyway thanks to all the kj
contributors. I learned a lot and was very happy to contribute!

best wishes for you domen + warm greetings
