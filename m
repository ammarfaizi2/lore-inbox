My point was just to note that people who look for information about emacs
or gcc in the proceedings of the OSDI or SIGOPS Symposium are going to 
be disappointed.

The bad news is that many of our customers now ask us if we support
"8.0" or "7.3".  For them "Red Hat" is the name of the system. Bob Young's

I'm sympathetic, but if there is anyone out there who has contributed 
free software and gets full credit and no hate mail, I'd be very surprised.

Envy is emulation adapted to the meanest capacity.
