Like I said yesterday, I'd love to see that happen, on the grounds that:

o  He has exhibited understanding of the subtleties of the IDE code --
	unlike MD.

o  He doesn't have a conflicting/macho personality -- unlike MD.
                                                                 
o  He actually knows what has to be done and has planned out a long-term
	schedule -- unlike MD.

T.
