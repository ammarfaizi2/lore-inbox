Once again, we have Mr. Merkey at it.  None of his problems can just be 
his, or caused by Novell.  They can't just be because, at one time (no 
longer though), Novell was THE economy for Utah Valley (Provo/Orem 
area).  They can't be because he has little respect for aspects of 
intellectual property (for those who believe in it or are under legal 
systems that do).  The mormons cause them all.

Get real, move on, and get a life Mr. Merkey.

For the record, I believe you are in the wrong here.  I believe that 
there are several non-mormon judges in the area (at least there were a 
little over a year ago when I lived there).

Yes, I am wayyyy off topic.  But lets keep it to the technology and the 
law.  If the finger has to be pointed, point it where it belongs and 
leave the predominant (60% tops) religion out of the picture.

Now back to your regularly schedule flame wars on different technology, 
real discusion, and the real world.

P.S. Sure, I am LDS (mormon).  I have a problem with the above because 
our religion requires us to stand for truth and I believe Mr. Merkey 
tends to misrepresent the religion.  I would have a problem with him 
misrepresenting any religion (if I knew he was doing so... with many 
religions I would likely not - still... it would be a problem).

P.P.S. Any flames or responses to this that want a response will reply 
in private.  I will not continue this on the list.
