Or just wait for a "good" one, whatever number that happens to be.

I believe Linus current development model is better than the old way,
because it keeps the kernel moving ahead.  But like you say, it's hard
on users.

My "distro" can't help me because I don't use a "distro."  There are
plenty of users rolling their own, via linuxfromscratch, diy-linux, or
some other alternative.

We would benefit from your proposal.
