Get it right, Andre.  The mere act of editing a file that is part of a
GPL-licensed source distribution doesn't bind anyone to anything.
Anyone can download GPLed source and edit it all they want without
restriction, and they can also produce binaries for private use from
those edited sources without restriction.  However, if they want to
distribute binaries derived from that source, edited or not, then the
GPL requires that they also distribute the source.
