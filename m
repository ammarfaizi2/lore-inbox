I can't claim to have any detailed knowledge of that, no.

That's true. I guess my lack of trust in vendor kernels is part being 
bitten by them in the past where my own custom build vanilla kernels have 
worked fine, and part the fear of getting locked-in to some vendor 
specific feature... Perhaps things are different these days and I should 
reevaluate my view on vendor kernels - but that's why I haven't been 
trusting them.
