It might be the ppc port is 2.4.0ac1 and 2.4.2 Linus or something. I don't think
that is likely to be a big problem. I need to get on top of 2.2.19pre4 and
the rest of the Linus resync then I'm going to dump chunks of stuff out of
-ac and try and get a nice clean -ac tree. If folks want to sync non x86
ports with that initially go ahead.
