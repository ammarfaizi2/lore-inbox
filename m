	Al salaam, 

My name is Haja mashed from Brunei I am a 23 years old and a mongolian =
citizen who was taken to Brunei by my father 10 years ago. He deceived me =
that I was going there on vacation and later married me out to a wealthy =
Prince in Brunei who is 30 years older than me.

I was thus forced into marriage and when I objected I was beaten and raped by =
this Prince. I was locked up in a house for six months after which I =
submitted and decided to accept my faith, knowing that was the only way out.

After I got my freedom back I have been allowed by my husband to have access =
to his account and businesses. With the help of a loyal aide I have been able =
to divert $16.5.000.000.00 (Sixteen million five hundred thousand dollars)as =
bonds into a private finance house without his knowledgement.

Right now I have mapped out a plan of escape out of Brunei,thou I have tried =
escaping several times and its been fruitless. first of all I have been able =
to move the fund out of Brunei. This is where I need your assistance,to help =
me secure the fund from the finance house before I get out of Brunei if I am =
lucky enough.

If you know you are capable of handling such a huge amount of money respond =
to me and I will compensate you by giving you $1.5.000.000.00 (one million =
five hundred thousand dollars) of the total fund.

Note also that you must keep this transaction secret as my life is at stake =
if my husband or any of his relatives hear of this transaction they will =
stone me to death or hang me.

I await your quick email.

Haja mashed
