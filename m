I would say "more than one idea" here, if something need changes in a
lot of places, so be it, they often won't work except as a whole. You
don't cross vast chasms in a series of small safe steps.

Hanging multiple indenpendent things in a single blob is bad practice,
of course.

  Programming without software engineering is like sculpting with a chain
saw. The very talented can produce a work of art, the mediocre wind up with
a misshapen lump in a pile of rubble, and in neither case does the end
result have more than a passing resemblance to the original intent.
