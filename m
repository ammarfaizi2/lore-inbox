both lock up under load. You dont run a busy ISP i guess. The fact that 
they come out with a new release every few minutes is clear evidence that 
it is problematic.

Intel doesnt sell the e100.o driver, so they couldnt give a rats ass if it 
doesnt perform. Note that the DO sell the drivers for other platforms, and 
they support them, a win for the other platforms.
