I hope you know the difference between a woman and a light bulb...

Apologies to the linux chix and humor impaired.  It was such
a big set-up it cried out for the punchline.

I actually agree somewhat with you.  If you can't unload
modules the only reasons to have them are to get out of
building kernels, or build and reboot when you get new
hot-plug hardware.  Laziness is a virtue, sloth is a sin,
the line betwen is hard to define.
