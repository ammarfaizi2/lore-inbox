Ok, lets change that to "on" and "off". That way, hopefully all the
drivers will agree that "off" means as low Dstate as possible.

It is not much more logical. First, noone really needs D1 and
D2. Plus, people want to turn their devices on and off, and don't want
and should not have to care about details like D1.
