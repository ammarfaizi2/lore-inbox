I've noticed that using smartctl on some of my drives kills them too.  I
didn't bother investigating much - too scared of losing data.  I kind of
assumed it was a problem with the drive not the code though, since it
worked fine on one drive but not the other.

I have a Maxtor and an IBM; unfortuantely I don't recall which one was
bokning out on smartctl...

If it's interesting (and resonably safe) I could do some testing on my
system.
