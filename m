Perhaps I should say again that my current IT job is working w/ small 
businesses and personal/home installations. In these cases, as well as 
with others, it is not so much the OS that I have a problem w/. It is 
the insistence of an all Macroshaft solution. Windows isn't totally bad. 
I would never say so. But being forced into M$ Office, MSIE, etc, and 
trying to support these arguably inferior products is a real PITA.

IE, Windows Web Sharing, MS Frontpage, etc are all bad knockoffs of 
other better products (IE isn't too bad, but I still don't like it, and 
I dislike Outlook{, Express} even more). Because they're M$ products, 
end [l]users believe that they must be more compatible or better than 
other solutions, (such as Netscape, Netscape Composer, WinRoute, etc).


M$ products are not all bad, but their marketing efforts and predatory 
efforts to lock people into these products is bad.

B/c M$ products are for the end luser, the lowest common denominator, I 
find them annoying when they try to fix my "mistakes", b/c they think 
they know better than I do. M$ is going toward Macintrash, point & 
drool, etc.
