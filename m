Well, I'll send you a six pack of Coca-Cola if you get this working. (Does not
apply if you are in EU ;-) )

I emailed the guys and they told me, "Hey, here you go, let me know if you
want more information"

I guess it can't be more distributable. But as far as I got to read. The
documents don't have too much information like for us to do a great Job. I
think it also requires the making of a firmware.

I don't want to dissapoint you, but I hope I'm lost and that a driver can be
done out of this.
