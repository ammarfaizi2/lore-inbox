Hello Sir/Madam,

I 'm very sorry to interrupt your peace Since you're not expecting to 
receive any mail from me. However, I was obliged to do so due to the 
importance and urgency of the message. I crave your indulgence, and want to 
reasure you that I mean well and that it is only for our mutual good. So 
please don,t be embarrassed as this's the only way I could make contact to 
you.

My name is Frank Smith, a Journalist attached to the United Kingdom 
military. I 'm writing  this message from Ar-ramadi in Iraq. We have moved 
around a few times building up F.O.B. around the western side of the country 
as well as missions into Baghdad, with attacks by insurgents everyday and 
car bombs, we managed to move funds belonging to Saddam Hussein’s family 
which we found in his palace after his arrest, The total amount is US$25 
Million dollars in cash, 100 dollar bills. We want to move this money out of 
Iraqi, since it's a war zone although  partially ended but the daily 
activities of suicide bombers is frighteningly on the increase.

I reached an agreement with the members of my team and we agreed to keep 
this money to ourselves and then moved the box out of Iraq to Europe (we 
have also concluded plans to move the money with help of some diplomatic 
officers.With their immunity as officials they're not searched at borders or 
Airports). Now, I 'm in need of anybody or company overseas whom I can 
confidently work with since my work does not permit me to own a foreign bank 
account or any personal business until  retirement. I have not finished my 
assignment and cannot return to the UK now.

I have the honor to confide this information in you and to request for your 
pleasure to assist in receiving  and secure the money, pending our 
retirement from service. You are therefore expected and advised to display 
high degree of maturity,responsibility and understanding in handling this 
information. I will give you all the details in my next mail when you have 
indicated your interest and commitment to work with me.

I hope you will honor me too. We can come over to join you for sharing and 
to guarantee that we have unlimited access to you. Moreso for an effective 
and easy communication I will advice that you furnish me with your phone 
numbers and other necessary details to make me rest assured that you are 
geniune.

I eagerly await your positive response.

Best regards,

Respectfully,

FRANK SMITH
Reporting from Ar-ramadi Iraq
