Let us not forget about 'deconstructionism':

    deconstructionism -- (a philosophical theory of criticism ...
    that seeks to expose deep-seated contradictions in a work
    by delving below its surface meaning)

It doesn't even matter what Rik thinks he wrote.  The real meaning is
what *we*, the readers, can devolve from his writings.
