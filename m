Hi all.
I'm currently working like a ClearCase admin and configuration manager in a
world-wide company. And I can say the CC (ClearCase) is unbelievable
expensive. In my country 1 developer  on-site license costs about $6500. And
another $6500 for multi-site license to share the same source code between
two or more sites or countries. You have to have both of them to access
multi-sited source database. It means $13000 !!!! for single developer.

I am one of two administrators too. Configuration of the fully automated
multi-sited with synchronisation of replicas system took us about 6 moths.
But now a year after it works fine and without significant troubles.

So this is my point of wiew from CC admin of CC network with cca 1000
developers. CC is milk cow for Rational and is totaly unusable for the linux
kernel developers. In this time I know nothing about BK, but who knows the
future ... :o)
