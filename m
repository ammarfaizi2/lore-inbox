There's really no such thing as a dumb question -- I dont see why you should stray away from this list. You're going to find the most intelligent people who know about the subject at hand on here anyway. I dont think you'll invoke Linus' wrath; instead you might get him to join in on your healthy conversation and he and others can enlighten us on why the design is what it is, and where we're headed. I don't forsee a few postings invoking discussion causing any issues or trouble on here. :)
