Greetings,
in past few days, I've been trying to obtain certian information about 
behavior of e100 NIC driver with my minipci card. My first hit was the 
contact information mentioned in the header of e100.c, that is, "Linux 
NICS <linux.nics@intel.com>".

I've sent in my mail, praying for reply. The first reply was automated 
response, which suggested me eg. Win 3.11 install notes. After asking 
tech support reply, the email from tech support, which arrived day 
later, only told me that Intel doesn't distribute MiniPCI cards 
directly, instead sells them to companies who distribute them. He also 
suggested me to "for the best possible technical support and the latest 
drivers for your MPCI hardware, please contact the manufacturer of your 
PC".

Since I sent a rather technical question, and got such reply (and no 
reply so far, when I asked for better support - contact on someone 
closer to the actual driver, be it from Intel or not, politely), I 
wonder whether the contact information is still up to date? If no, what 
is the new contact information?

Thanks in advance.
