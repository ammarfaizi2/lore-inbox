i think you have outlook confused with lotus notes.  outlook (and
outlook express) can _easily_ be configured to do all of those.  i WILL
send a case of beer to the first person to tell me how to do that in a
standard notes r5 windows client.  2 cases of beer if you can make it
integrate gvim as the default editor.
