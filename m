I agree, but we know some strange 'behaviour' of MS.
They have a lot of lawers, they can make us a lot of trouble.
(You will notice that there are no copyright statment on that file,
only the name of authors).

Remember the RMS (a flame with the word 'ESR' MUST have also the 'RMS' :-))
way to include 'free' patches: sign and send to FSF a piece of paper,
that the patches CAN be included.
I think nobody in Linux have done that, thus we can expect some
more troubles and microsoft is a large troubles-maker
