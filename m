I just had kmail play a short ogg sample to tell me new mail had 
arrived.  xmms was playing another ogg at the instant.  Xmms was 
instantly locked out, with a requester from what I think is artsd on 
the screen.

I had to restart xmms several times to clear the lockout.

Any clues?  Kernel is 2.6.0.test9-mm3, running the as scheduler at the 
moment.
