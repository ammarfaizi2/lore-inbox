Are you using IPX or TCP/IP or UDP?  Are you using the same on both?
Are the two boxes in the same place and on the same connection/the same
speed?  For example if one box is sitting close to the netware server
and the other further away, on a congested network, it is much more
likely to loose the connection.  Also IPX is much worse than UDP.  Our
connection loss problems decreased a lot when we moved from IPX to UDP.
Haven't had much experience with TCP/IP yet.  Also so far we have not
seen any connection loss problems since we switched from 2.4 to 2.6
kernels (suse 9.3, i.e. 2.6.11.4-21.9).

One of the reasons for a connection disappearing is that the NCP
sequence numbers on the netware server and the linux client become out
of sync.  When the netware server detects this it shuts down the
connetion.  Linux can't do reconnects so you get exactly the errors you
see and the connection is gone.  The fix is to umount and to mount again
when this happens.

To see if this is your problem, insert some printk()s in the relevant
ncpfs code (depends whether you are using ipx or tcp/udp as to where)
and see if they are triggered.  We have been trying to track this down
for years and have failed so far...  We were hoping the problems had
gone away with the 2.6 kernel but if you are seeing them maybe we will
start seing them once term starts and Linux is used more again...  (We
only switched to 2.6 this summer.)

That is irrelevant.  Only the kernel driver version matters.

Hope this is useful.

Best regards,
