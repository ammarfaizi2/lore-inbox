	Hello all ,  A gent posted to the ietf mailing list a message .
	(a portion of which is shown beloiw , Author removed for privacy)
	When I went to the url presented below I found the resources there
	dating from Aug-2000 .  So I think that the project died a quick
	death .  But I was hoping that someone in the Linux community may
	have picked it up & carried on .  If anyone knows of a simular
	project I would be appreciative of the pointer .

	Is this project on going to anyones knowledge ?

	Is there a simular project on going to anyones knowledge ?

Fro the people that were interested I found:
http://www.sprintlabs.com/Department/IP-Interworking/multicast/linux-igmpv3/

Which is an alpha implementation of IGMPv3 released under GPL. No router
capabilities yet... but promising...
