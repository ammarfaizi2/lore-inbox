So, you are new to Linux kernel hacking and want to submit a kernel bug
report or a patch but don't know how to do it and _where_ to report it?
Then save this file for future reference.

Preparing bug report:
=====================
Compile problems: report GCC output and result of "grep '^CONFIG_' .config"
Oops: decode it with ksymoops
Unkillable process: Alt-SysRq-T and ksymoops relevant part
Yes it means you should have ksymoops installed and tested,
which is easy to get wrong. I've done that too often.

More info in the FAQ at http://www.tux.org/lkml/

Sending bug report/patch:
=========================
* Some device drivers have active developers, try to contact them first.
* Otherwise find a subsystem maintainer to which your report pertains
  and send report to his address.
* Small fixes and device driver updates are best directed to subsystem
  maintainers and "small bits" integrators.
* It never hurts to CC: Linux kernel mailing list, but without specific
  maintainer address in TO: field there is high probability that your
  patch won't be noticed. You have been warned.
* Do not send it to all addresses at once! This will annoy lots of people
  and isn't useful at all. It's a spam.
* Do NOT send small fixes to Linus, he just can't handle _everything_.
  He will eventually receive it from maintainers/integrators, send it
  their way.
* If your patch is something big and new, announce it on lkml and try
  to attract testers. After it has been tested and discussed, you can
  expect Linus to consider inclusion in mainline.

	I work on the frame buffer subsystem, the m68k port (Amiga part),
	and the PPC port (CHRP LongTrail part).
	Unfortunately I barely have spare time to really work on these
	things. My job is not Linux-related (so far :-). I can not
	promise anything about my maintainership performance.

	I also want to receive bug reports and patches for following
	USB drivers: printer, acm, catc, hid*, usbmouse, usbkbd, wacom.
	All other (not in the list) USB driver changes should go to USB
	maintainer (hopefully there is one listed here :-).
	Also CC me if you are posting VIA IDE driver related message
	(although I am not IDE subsystem maintainer).

Linus Torvalds <torvalds@transmeta.com> [5 feb 2002]
	Do not send anything to me unless it is for 2.5, well tested,
	discussed on lkml and is used by significant number of people.
	In general it is a bad idea to send me small fixes and driver
	updates, send them to subsystem maintainers and/or
	"small stuff" integrator (currently Dave Jones, see his entry)
	Sorry, I can't do everything.

Marcelo Tosatti <marcelo@conectiva.com.br> [5 feb 2002]
	Do not send anything to me unless it is for 2.4 and well tested.
	If you are sending me small fixes and driver updates, send
	a copy to subsystem maintainers and/or "small stuff" integrator
	(currently Alan Cox, see his entry).
