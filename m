Speaking about Baltics, when St. Petersburg was original St. Petersburg,
Baltics were in Russia. It was renamed Leningrad at the (approximately)
same time Baltics were freed first time and Soviet Union was form, if you like
:).
SU matched back into Baltics later.

By the way St. Petersburg is not _formally_ after Peter the Great.
Peter the Great is not Saint.

And yes, my Mom who who was born there still calls it Leningrad (or Piter, but
not
St. Petersburg). And so am I.
