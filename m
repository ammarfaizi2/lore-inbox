I've already commented on the fsf site about this in the same way, and I 
wasn't the first one. The only problem with this, from the FSF p.o.v. is 
when this draft will not be automatically applied to all those pieces of 
code licensed under "v2 or any later", the power of their political 
message will be reduced to those choosing freely to convert to the new 
license. I have no idea how many that would be, but those that do would 
actually support their political agenda, which would be much better from 
the "free" perspective.

If they choose to "upgrade" the GPL from v2 to this draft, they will 
never again get support from those who feel betrayed in their trust of 
the FSF in keeping the GPL to its original meaning in v2 (but not from 
its original intended meaning, so probably it would have been misplaced 
trust)

So who would get "hurt" by this? People who licensed their code under 
the GPLv2 or later, naively thinking that the license text was the 
intended goal of the license.

Still, these are interesting times in free/open source software world ;-)
