Well, i followed this thread on and off and i'd like to add a few words
of mine;

I think the harder one tries to enforce things on ppl the more
resistance is created. The 'free' countries who don't buy that DRM crap
will have a mighty opening in the market by creating machines which
allow you to do whatever you want (think of the region free players).
Just like the music industry is battling the ocean, they can't stop it,
cause ppl like to be free in their choices and creativeness. Yet the
internet music income is increasing which proves them wrong anyway.

I'd rather buy chinese hardware which i can do whatever i want to do
with and/or create software for than something of those who want to
control ppl in what they do and don't. Next thing is when you start your
system a signal is sent that "Drone 87-3KD983S" is now working on his
system.

Just remember, there are alway solutions, but not at the price of freedom.

Greetz,

Mark
