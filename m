Subject: disappearing cdrom on reboot with 2.4.7-ac10

Hello all,

Someplace between ac7 and ac10 the changes cause my cdrom to disappear from
the bios scan on reboot.  Here's the details:

I have two HD's and one cdrom.  With ac7 it is found by the bios during
reboot and shows up as found on the screen.  With ac10 the bios detects the
two hd's but gives an error on the cdrom until the power is cycled
(reset button doesn't fix it).  The cdrom driver is compiled as a module
and mounting a cdrom in the drive before doing a reboot fixes the problem.

I have checked the kernel output during the two different boots in
/var/log/messages for diferences and found none.

Here's the edited output from /var/log/messages and my .config  I have to
use noautotune to keep from getting timeout errors on these drives.  This
started happening with 2.4.7 no ac.
