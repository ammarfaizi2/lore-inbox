Subject: x86 instability with 2.6.1{8,9}

 Hi, I've been running an athlon64 in 64-bit mode without problems,
up to and incluing 2.6.19.1.  A couple of weeks ago I decided to use
it for testing x86 builds, since then it's been nothing but trouble
in 32-bit mode.  It still works fine when I boot it in 64-bit mode.

 I already had a 32-bit system on the disk, but it was somewhat old
(gcc-3.4.6, udev from a long while ago, glibc-2.3.4) so I wasn't
totally surprised when it started to spontaneously reboot.

 Eventually, I installed a recent system to build a fresh 32-bit
system.  Still suffered from reboots - sometimes within a few
minutes of booting, sometimes it was fine for hours.  Tried various
versions of 2.6.18.x, eventually thought it was ok, built my new
system in several stages.  On Saturday it was running the fresh system
under 2.6.18.6 for most of the day without problems (although
admittedly the first part was from the console, and only the last 2
or 3 hours were running X).  Yesterday I left it building arts, and
it rebooted.  It was then able to finish building much of kde, and
then built 2.6.19.1.  Booted into 2.6.19.1, spent several hours using
the desktop and running compiles and tests.

 Today, in 2.6.19.1, the keyboard LEDs for caps and scroll lock
started flashing about 30 minutes after I'd booted it, so I guess it
had oopsed.  Unfortunately, nothing from the oops made it to the
logs, although SysRq+b worked, so I guess I need to look at the
SysRq options before it happens again.

 So, at the moment I've still got nothing in the logs from any of
this, and it isn't predictable.  This all happens while running X
(originally 6.8.2, now 7.1).  I'm beginning to despair of getting
any indications about what is going wrong.  Any suggestions, please
?

 Current ver_linux and config follow.
