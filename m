Subject: Pressing no Key on Keyboard --> Linux hangs if switching of the monitor

Hi,
if I start my computer and booting linux it will hang if linux try to 
switch of the monitor after many minutes. The system hangs. I can only 
see a black screen on the monitor. The system do nothing. No network 
(ping), no MagicSysRequest-Keys and no light from the numlock-key work 
anymore.

But it _only_ happens if I pressing no key on the keyboard (except the 
ESC for skipping the memory-check). If I press a key on booting linux, 
the monitor switch off normal and everything work fine.

Okay, normaly you would say, that's a hardware-problem but it works in 
2.4.9 (and earlier) (with a littel other .config, I'll try it soon with 
the same). I had the crash on: 2.4.10, .13 , .15-pre4.

I switched off ACPI and it's the same. After the text I post my .config 
(with ACPI). Maybe it helps.

My Hardware:
Mainboard: 	Gigabyte 6BXS with PIII 800 Mhz (FSB100)
		512 MB Ram
		Elsa Erazor X (NVIDIA Geforce256) 32MB
Monitor: Iiyama Vision Master 400

Any ideas?

Please CC me!

Bye
	Daniel
