I don't think it's reasonable to expect people to behave in a different
manner from the way they currently behave. I've heard this described as
a brutal meritocracy, and organizations that need any of the above to
meet their objectives are free to implement them at their own cost and
to their own (and presumably their customers') benefit.

That said, I think Linux could benefit greatly from some of the above,
in particular c. and e. And the recent debate over printk vs. event logs
would be a non-issue if we had b. and d. -- we'd have both because one
is wonderful for rapid debugging and the other is wonderful for system
administration.
