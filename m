I've been using 2.6.11.11 just fine, but I thought I'd give 2.6.12-rc6 a
test run.  With 2.6.11.11, my mouse works as expected (wheel works fine),
however, 2.6.12-rc6 this is not true.  I saw there were some changes with
regards to the mouse, and it's apparent these changes have affected my
system in a negative way.  I have the Logitech MX 1000 connected to a Belkin
OnmiCube switch via PS2.  Please CC me as I'm not a subscriber to this list.
I'd be more than happy to test any possible fixes.  Oh, this is on a Linux
>From Scratch 6.0 (w/BLFS updates) system with dual athlon MPs.

Steve
