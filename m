Hi,

I know I'm late, but Configure.help in 2.2.19 says:

..."The TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) timer is a watchdog"...

I know TCO meaning that, but I can't believe it for a mainboard 
component. Should the user then throw the PC away, or what? Or is it 
more safe to reboot frequently. What has this to do with costs?

Confused,
Ulrich
