the age does, however not say anything about the intention and preparations.
The version numbers are mainly to communicate intention. Otherwise you can
use a timestamp.

And thats why I dont think it is good to keep innovations back by not
opening a 2.7 tree nor is it good to caue trouble for users by merging a lot
of new features to 2.6.

A lot of media and books has explained the linux numbering scheme, this is
valuable knowledge, dont dump it.
