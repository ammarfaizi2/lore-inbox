Sigh. If you're so convinced that there's no money in larger systems,
why don't you write to Sam Palmisano and explain to him the error of
his ways? I'm sure IBM has absolutely no market data to go on ...

If only he could receive an explanation of the error of his ways from
Larry McVoy, I'm sure he'd turn the ship around, for you obviously have
all the facts, figures, and experience of the server market to make this
kind of decision. I await the email from the our CEO that tells us how 
much he respects you, and has taken this decision at your bidding.

M.
