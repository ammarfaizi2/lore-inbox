I've tried both D4X GTK2 (2.4.0-rc1) based and GTK1.2.x (1.3.0) based, same results.

I add a download, let it partially download, then press
"Continue/Restart Downloads"

-> Retry 1 ...
-> Trying to connect...
-> Socket was opened!
-> Trying to create a file
+  File was created!
!! File is already opened by another download!
!! Downloading was failed...

ok, back in 2.4.20, Same file (everything as above)...however, it carrys on.
