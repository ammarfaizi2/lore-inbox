April Fool's Day (1 april) is quite popular in Scandinavia, for
example.  At least in Sweden, even the so-called "legitimate news
media" get into it, usually with exactly one fake story per
publication/news program.  The day after the newspapers usually let
you know which one it was, and what other newspapers did :)
