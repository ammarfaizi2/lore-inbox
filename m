Comparing this to 2.4 achieves nothing because so much changed.

The point of these benchmarks are not marketing, but to find
improvements or regressions from one version to the next and find out
what caused them.

Comparing the kernel to 2.4 has some uses (i.e. finding micro-ops) but
Con's mission is much different (and imo more useful).
