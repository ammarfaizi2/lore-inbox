Hello

I have a system setup as a black box. If the system is powered
off accidentally, and upon powering on the system keeps rebooting 
after trying to do the file system consistency check. The file 
system message is to run "ef2fsck -v -y <partition>. Is there
anyway to force this check at lilo prompt? 

Thanks for any help.
