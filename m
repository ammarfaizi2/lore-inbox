Subject: Syscalls being obsoleted???

I read somewhere that (all) syscalls (as in the method of calling them) 
are being obsoleted, unfortunately this makes for a rather poor search 
term.
Thus the question: is this true and with what is this being replaced?  
[just a link would be sufficient]

Thanks,
MaZe.
