well, it's possible to have a large intermediate buffer on the kernel
space and do memcpy from it to the hardware audio buffer in the
interrupt handler.
but, in general, we don't want such a heavy job in the interrupt
context.  or, using a tasklet?  hmm...

anyway, if you want to run a realtime audio application, this
mechanism is nothing but a kludge.  this must be swithable somehow.
