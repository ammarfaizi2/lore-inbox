For the last time, i didn't change the interview text or cut anything. If
you want to continue throwing shit to me because you are not responsible
of your words, please publish the logs.  I'm beginning to get tired of
sentences like: "That assumes it is my assertion, it appears the
journalist in question is missing a few lines from his IRC log though...".
That's not true.

If you saw some differences beetween my version an yours, why didn't you
tell me that? Maybe because in reality there were not? This controversy is
started almost 2 days after the publishing of the article. If lies or
inaccuracies would be written on it you'd have all the time you needed to
tell me. You started to affirm that there were cuts only after the first
Andrea's email. Please be fair and get your own resposibilities.

You chose IRC, I don't.
