Hi Xiong,
     you can get a lot of books on kernel internals... But my experience says...
reading code is the best solution....all the intricacies can only be cleared
when u hack the code....
btw a new "understanding the linux kernel" by O'reilly pub. can be helpful in
'code reading'.

Amol

hello. i read linux kernel internal. are there other books/papers
like that which dwell with linux kernel in detail,especially on
process mechanism,for example,how pthread and fork are implemented,
how clone actually work.are there other materials on these topics
on internet that can be downloaded freely.
