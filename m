I really don't agree.  It seems you confuse source and binary application.

The source surelly is not derived, you can link *any* libc to your
program.

But a binary is different.

Let start with your example about books: you write a book, you have
the copyright of the text, but if you publish it with X publiher, he
may use a own font.  You can read the book, scan it to extract text
(I hope fair use allows it), but not copy the book pages: there is
your text, but also copyrighted font.  Publisher should check
that the two license are compatible, as the user that links
with a new library.

For binary, it is the same. You can extract libraries and rest of
programs (better doing with sources), but until it is one binary,
it is a new mixed entity.

It is not only linking, it is mixing bytes! Some part of library is
linked statically, there are some references in the static part of
program. It is a mix and until the two part are mixed (not only linked)
you should follow both licenses for copying!

Choose any dynamic program in your machine, try to link glibc with an
other (not directly derived libc) library... you see how it is hard,
and it is very different to an "aggregation".  And dynamic links is
only the latest step of "merging" the two binaries.

Other libraries tend to be more "dynamic", but glibc mixes to much

In other word, source A, library B: the binary C is derived both from A
and B, but surelly A is not derived by B.  So IMHO IANAL, in arguments
we should not confuse the sources and the binary in the arguments, so
not calling simply "the program".
