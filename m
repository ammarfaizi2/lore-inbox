This is for what I have said that. Sometimes the people says. "This is good for Desktop, but drops the performance / throughput 20%". Perhaps some people prefer having a true multimedia desktop without skips in the music and video, and less throughput (like i prefer).

But let Con do it's best. I think he knows what is doing  ;)

Thanks Con and others!
