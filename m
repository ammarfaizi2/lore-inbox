It might be good if I (and others who are interested) worked on a document
describing the work flow that has been discussed here, in particular
the sort of network of people that Linus mentioned and Dave showed in
his ascii art.  That document would be a useful thing to hand to newbies
regardless of whether BK or any other CVS is in the picture because it
would describe how things work today, more or less.

It is also useful as a stake in the ground which says that any CVS
which wants to be considered in this problem space has to solve that
work flow, or come pretty darn close.  If BK can do it, that would be
good, that's why we built it.  If it can't, you still get a useful doc
describing how things work and we can go back and try and fix BK.

If you think this is a good idea and you are one of the 20-30 maintainers
close to the center of the network, let me know.  If anyone wants to work
on this or just watch the progress, I can have a mailing list set up 
tomorrow.  If there is interest in the doc, I think I could have something
with nice pictures and text in a week.
