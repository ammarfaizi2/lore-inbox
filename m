Hi all,

I have an easy question and I hope that some of you can help me.

I installed a ltmodem-6.00 drivers for my T21 Thinkpad on kernel 2.4.10.

I run a script called autoload that try to load the compiled module that
need to use nfsd.

The problem is that with my kernel configuration I am not able to load it.

I know that sunrpc and lockd modules are necessary and I already loaded
them, but when I issue the command

    insmod nfsd

the following message appear:


        nfsd.o: unresolved symbol nfsd_linkage

attached there is my kernel config file.

Please can you tell me if I need to enable some other options?

Thanx in advance and excuse me if I submit this easy question on this
mail list.
