Subject: very large FAT16 partition not readable on 2.6.0-test11

Hi all,

I just bought a new USB/Firewire external drive.  It comes pre-formatted
as FAT16 (or so shows fdisk) as one big 80Gb partition.  Unfortunately,
Linux can't seem to mount this partition, and I get the following dmesg
output when trying to mount the partition:
	FAT: bogus number of reserved sectors
	VFS: Can't find a valid FAT filesystem on dev sdb1.

Now before I blow it away and put a sane filesystem on this disk, I
saved off the MBR and the initial portion of the partitions if anyone
wants to poke around and take a look at it.  I'll keep the filesystem
as-is for a few days if anyone wants me to get any more data from it.

The files are:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/fat16_mbr.gz
	(generated by: 'dd if=/udev/sdb  count=1 bs=512 > fat16_mbr')

	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/fat16_sdb.gz
	(generated by: 'dd if=/udev/sdb  count=1000 bs=512 > fat16_sdb')

	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/fat16_sdb1.gz
	(generated by: 'dd if=/udev/sdb  count=1000 bs=512 > fat16_sdb1')

Oh, 2.4.23 also can't seem to read it, so it doesn't look like this is a
regression or anything.

thanks,

greg k-h
