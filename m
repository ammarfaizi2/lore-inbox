If I had been sitting there with a copy of clearcase or reverse engineering
from the data stored by clearcase, I'm pretty sure rational would have 
something to say about it.

But you are still missing the point.  As long as the feeling is that it is
OK to reverse engineer by staring at the file formats, the corporations
will respond by encrypting the data you want to stare at.

In other words, it's pretty much hopeless to try and catch up that way,
you might as well go try and build something better from the start.
