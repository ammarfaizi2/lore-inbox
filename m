Agreed, it's a good point.

Note that for long time, I've commented that I myself do _not_
recommend to use ALSA API directly with apps.  Rather I've recommended
to use other portable libraries with ALSA/other backends.  Writing an
app with alsa-lib is just like to write a graphical program with X11
lowlevel library without any toolkits...

Heh, it's natural that developers think their own things work better
:)

I, at least, have never thought that the OSS _API_ would die.  Since
they have existed, they will exist.  The question on LKML should be
rather the implementation (for apps it doesn't matter how the sound
system is implemented as long as it keeps API).

In the implementation of OSS API, there is a clear bottleneck: you
have to implement everthing in the kernel level because of its
definition.  Remember that the original thread started from the
reduction of the kernel codes.  Putting more stuff which could be done
better in user-space is a major drawback, IMO.
