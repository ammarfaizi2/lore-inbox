No. If there are, say, five companies in the market that might hire you
for top $$$ and in the course of one of these contracts, you break
an NDA for all the good reasons and even get away with it, the others will
never ever again touch you with a polestick. So this is economic retaliation
without even having to go to court. You can't force them to hire you.

Keeping your mouth shut even if you know something that is not legal?
Not nice, but normal. Immoral? Yes. But understandably if you have
mouth to feed and mortgages to pay.

	Regards
		Henning
