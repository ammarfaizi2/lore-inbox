Hi Guys,

I updated three boxes today to 2.4.28 (from .27), one at work, and two here at 
home (Redhat 7.1+, Slackware 10)

I am intrigued terribly by the small footprint of memory usage now.  I have 
gone through the changes file, but can really see nothing (to me, a n00b) 
that would alter that?

Can anyone enlighten me?

As always, great work too :)

Nick
