Yup.  It's high time they realized that Linux exists today solely because a 
lazy Finnish student conned a bunch of folks into doing his homework.  His 
"Tom Sawyer::whitewashing fences is fun'" swindle worked too well, and he 
doesn't have the heart to tell everybody that he _graduated_.

Linux exists because working for fun is free... or something like that ;-)

         HAPPY NEW YEAR!
