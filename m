They'd just drop Linux from the list of supported OS's, Linux will
disappoint people who trusted it, nothing is gained. Deliberate breakage
will not happen, because it would not help anyone except people with
twisted minds.

NO-ONE, including you, has come up with SERIOUS objections against a
dirsync option, except "is it really so much slower than chattr +S? show
figures" -- ext3 is being tuned to be fast in spite of chattr +S.

Reconsider your position.

Stop trolling please.
