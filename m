Hi,

You requested piecemeal of kbuild-2.5, and I'm currently hashing it. Thus 
one question: someone mentioned to migrate current kbuild-2.4 to 
kbuild-2.5, while Kaos' version suggests to at first have a separate 
Makefile-2.5.

Which do you prefer now? Shall I have it into the current Makefile, or in 
a separate Makefile-2.5?

Regards,
Thunder
