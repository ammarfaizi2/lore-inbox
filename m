Depending on the model of your car, you might be surprised what the gains 
could be. Lots of ECMs are shipped out with very conservative timings. 
This is especially true of turbocharged cars, where the effect of the 
turbocharger increasing the normal relative constant of atmospheric 
pressure also tends to multiply many of the other factors as well.
