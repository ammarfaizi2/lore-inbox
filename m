Claiming anything send by email is confidential seems completely
rediculous to me.

Perhaps if the email was encrypted I could attach some weight to a
disclaimer like that, but sending unencrypted email is like writing on
the back of a postcard - it can be read by a huge number of people in
transit - admins managing the mail servers where it is stored along
the way, people sniffing traffic on the lines it passes through,
people sticking their noses in your computers mbox file while you are
on the toilet etc etc etc...
And when you on top of that send the mail to a public mailing list,
well, it's hardly confidential any more by anyones standards...

Complete and utter nonsense if you ask me.
