After trying numerous kernel versions I've had very sluggish typing in
the console since 2.6.13-rcX (can't remember when it started). But I
have to hit a key twice, cursor up or down does not show history, some
times it does nothing, other times it acts like I hit tab-tab. I'm
running 2.6.15 on 4 system, 2.6.15-rc2 on my laptop and they all have
this problem. I have 2 servers right now with the same problem, I think
they are 2.6.14.2. All custom configs. All the systems are intel
p4/pd/centrino, various chipsets, i845, i875p, i925. Is their a patch or
work around for this problem. I have spoke with a few other people with
the same problem.

Also sometimes it stops and all is fine for about 10 seconds, irq
polling issue?

Please help,
TIA,
Dan.
