And they need what kind of cooling to get there? Compare that to a
passively cooled G4.[1]

This is AFAIK not true for every RISC chip, I believe current ultrasparc
and alpha even more so do need significant cooling as well.
But IMO your question is not really relevant to the discussion, as
especially the common CISC examples you are referring to are artificially
pushed to higher clock speeds. Compare those to a passively cooled
transmeta or via chip and it you can ask about clock speeds CISC vs CISC
instead of CISC vs RISC.
Or compare a Transmeta or Via chip with RISC cores and see who wins the
clockspeed race then :-)

[1] Yes, those dual powermacs have a case exhaust fan which draws air over
    the CPUs' fin. So has the fastest passively cooled, not clocked down
    intel desktop I've ever seen, a 300MHz pII Dell Dimension. (That's
    also still the most silent "high-end" intel desktop I've ever seen)
