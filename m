dude, name calling is way out of line here.

Why is it a good thing you are blocking this driver? Do you have ANY
indication AT ALL that there is anything fishy about it?
(and don't say "they didn't follow cleanroom procedure", because you
know that cleanroom is not the only way to do reverse engineering
properly).

Paying attention to proper reverse engineering is good. Being
overzealous is not.
