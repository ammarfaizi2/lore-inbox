We probably have a lot of bugs which just got quietly fixed, but are still
open.

Could anyone who has ever raised a bug please review the bugs which you
raised and, if necessary, retest?

If the bug is unreproducible or was just some random oops which happened
ages ago then it's probably best to close it off - it it's real then it'll
happen again.

thanks.
