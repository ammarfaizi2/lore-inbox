There are for-profit models of selling GPL software.  Anyway, billions of
dollars are still spent every year on software.

You should look at the dwindling manufacturing sector in America and
notice that the same thing is happening there without any GPL to blame.

This is just utter nonsense; most litigation in the software industry
occurs between closed source vendors.

By which measure has the market collapsed?  Whatever you mean, my guess is
that you're overestimating the role of the GPL.  More likely, you're just
misinterpreting globalization and the natural transition of the sector
into more of a commodity market.

Hah!  By your definition of the word, American capitalism is just another
"religion".

This movement has spawned a global attitude supporting greater consumer
rights.  Overall, its been a very positive and healthy force.

Oh please, how exactly does GPL software undermine human rights?
