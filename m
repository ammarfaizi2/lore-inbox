I'm still unsure whether idr has a sufficient advantage over simply
hashing the inodes.  Hch has suggested that keeping the hashtable
smaller is good for performance.  But idr adds new complexity, which
should be avoided on its own right.  So is the performance benefit big
enough to add more complexity?  Is it even measurable?
