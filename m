Vendors should understand that ACTUALLY supporting linux means adopting 
the free software philosophy. In many cases, vendors think that they 
should be the only one to be able to write drivers, since 99% of desktop 
users dont care about their software freedom. Vendors should not try to 
obscure the workings of their devices, they should show the world how 
they are innovating in hardware design by releasing specs on a 
freely-redistributable basis. This would greatly improve competiveness 
and innovation in the domain of hardware design. Give me a binary driver 
and i will  buy from you once, give me the specs and i'll appreciate the 
effort you put in designing the device.
