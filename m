I have seen this problem sometimes.  I don't read German though - does the
page mention a fix?

My machines usually run 24/7 too, but there's this little think called DRI
which for some people works really nicely.  Some of us are not as lucky
though and in the meantime have problems with rebooting our machines.  It
seems that an ATX power off is not sufficient to get things going again,
power must be cut to the main supply for a few seconds first.  Thankfully
my PSU has a real switch.

I sat laughing snidely into my notebook until they showed me a PC running
Linux. And oh! It was as though the heavens opened and God handed down a
client-side OS so beautiful, so graceful, and so elegant that a million
Microsoft developers couldn't have invented it even if they had a hundred
years and a thousand crates of Jolt cola.
