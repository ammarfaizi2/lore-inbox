Hi,

We at linuxsecurity.com just released an article on the new security
features of the 2.4 kernel, and thought the kernel list would be
interested.

"This document outlines the kernel security improvements that have been
made in the 2.4 kernel. A number of significant improvements including
cryptography and access control make 2.4 a serious contender for secure
corporate environments as well as private virtual networking."

Recently we also released another document outlining the packet
filtering/mangling abilities in the new netfilter that might also be of
interest:

Best,
