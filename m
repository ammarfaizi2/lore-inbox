hi all

yesterday i got my redhat 7.2 up and running.it had a package for palying audiocd's.its called cdp and had a text interface for a dumb terminal.inoticed a strange behavior.i was listening to the song and i gave the shutdown command..even when the system i completely halted(power down too) the cdp is still running.(i think it should as iam listening  the songs still).i have a creative cdrom.i have a doubt.are there any cdroms which are programmed to behave this way.i mean which depend on BIOS may be..i didnt make anything how its running.

i dont know whether its related to kernel or not but please try to clarify me.

thanks
pavan
