I want to underscore this.  I don't buy hardware until I know that it's
possible to *keep* it running with Linux.  If the driver is closed-source,
I'll buy something else or do without.  Secret magic firmware would be
grudgingly accepted, but only if there isn't a comparable product with no
secrets.
