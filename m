The confirmed talks for this year's UK Unix User Group Linux Developers' 
Conference in Manchester (Friday 29th June to Sunday 1st July) are now 
listed at:
  http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2001/speakers.shtml
together with short biographies of the speakers (with some photos).

Topics covered by the programme include:
  vsyscalls, NUMA, zero copy, O_DIRECT, Sledgehammer port,
  JFFS, Dynamic Probes, Generalised Kernel Hooks Interface, 
  Powertweak, LVS, Heartbeat, DCE, Samba TNG, KDE Architecture, 
  Zope, Pymmetry, FlightGear & more

An extra attraction this year will be a demonstration of 'The Baby' 
(the world's first stored-program electronic digital computer) on
the Friday evening.

I'm sending this message now to remind those of you on this list who 
wish to attend (but aren't speaking) that to get into the conference 
at the cheapest price you need to make your booking by the end of next 
week.  The price is low this year because of financial support 
from IBM (who've been particularly generous) and Sistina Software.
