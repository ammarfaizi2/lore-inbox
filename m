Have you tried those with cables longer than 20 feet?  I was totally happy
with my Netgear cards with a 10ft crossover until I tried connecting a
couple of new computers to my file server in the closet with 25ft CAT5
and then all the UDP (most noticeably NFS) traffic turned to crap.

I returned everything and got all D-link hardware.  Works great.  I'm not
going to buy Netgear hardware for the foreseeable future.
