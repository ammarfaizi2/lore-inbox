  As someone who normally just watches I will meekly add, that makes a LOT
of sense. Because the address could be IDE_Subsystem@vger.kernel.org and
then if that person passed on the maintainership, the maintainer patch would
have the correct e mail address and only the name would be out of date. Thus
keeping ease of submission at least.
