while trying to compile linux-2.4.15-pre4 for a diskless kiosk client,
the compile (bzImage) failed on compiling 
setup.c:2791 "Subscribed value is neither array or pointer"
setup.c:2792 "warning: control reaches end of non-void function"
(arch/i386/kernel/setup.c)

the configuration was set for no ext2 support, no ide/scsi support, nfs
root + bootp / rarp / dhcp in 'kernel network autoconfiguration'.

below i have inlined the .config file i used when this error occured,

Any and all information is welcome ;-)

pls cc me in the replies since i'm not subscribed to the kernel list.
