I am working an a kernelhacking-HOWTO at:

http://www.kernelhacking.org

The aim of the document is to make kernel programming more accesible to
those with limited time.  Anyone with C programming and Linux experience
should be able to get something out of the document.

It is work in progress, but I try to release a new version each week.

The kernelnewbies mailing list is a better place to ask newbie questions
btw.

HTH,

Andy
