Hello.
I'm trying to get this usb adsl modem to work
with the latest stable kernel.
I searched for this on the ML archive, and realized
that the kernel module should be used.
But I can't understand one thing (at least...)
which consequences does the new alcatel module
driver have on getting this modem to work?
Does it override kernel setup described on
the speedbundle site, or not?
How should the kernel be compiled?

Many thanks,

*Guldo*
