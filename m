OK.

Yes, that's what I'd hope, unless the disk ran out of spare space to
allocate.

No, the last SMART test re-allocated one sector.  That sector may have
gone bad in the next few minutes.  Unlikely, but possible.

The drive has _done_ a reallocation.  You posted that the reallocated
sector count had gone from 1 to 2.  This is why I said if it can't fix
the problem, bin it.  It doesn't seem to have fixed the problem yet.

Somebody else might read this thread, and want full instructions.  It
might be your crash box, but somebody else might have data they want
to preserve.

1. I know.  I read your original post
2. I am providing instructions that other people might follow in the
   future, that is why I am making sure they are complete.
3. Run the tests again.  Your drive fixed one bad sector, let's see if
   it completes the test again without finding more.

John.
