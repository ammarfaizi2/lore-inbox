Before I start working on this I would like to find
out 
if it is possible or at least useful.

Is it feasible?
To create a BIOS that would help the kernel  (working
together).

What if the BIOS booted the PC in protected mode ,
 enabling the A20 (taking away all that backwards
support, so on),
 And then implement a realible interface.

Wouldn't that be faster?
Would the kernel be able to communicate to it?

Thanks Profetas
