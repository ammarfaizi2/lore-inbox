Just to clarify -- I am aware (and have been since it's inception) of 
Coverity's previous work on the subject. I was one of the guys at 
Stanford who started pushing Linux through the technology years and 
years ago :) However, the "new process" piece is the fact that now we 
have the infrastructure in place to provide the results of the daily 
scans that we are performing of the kernel and other open source 
projects back to the developers and core maintainers of those projects.

Sorry about any confusion caused by my terminology with "Linux". I 
admit, form email and should have been "Linux kernel"...
