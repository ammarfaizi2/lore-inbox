My opinion literally shouldn't matter to you.

You can do anything you want. But if you start linking with the kernel,
you should talk to your lawyer, because it is going to be _your_ problem
(not mine) if you're found to be in violation of copyright.

I'm trying to explain what is _clearly_ ok.

It is _clearly_ ok to make a module that is 100% GPL'd.

And it is _clearly_ ok to do anything you want with user space programs.

Everything else, you need to convince _your_ lawyers that it is ok before
you do it. They may say "go ahead". But you're not getting a "get out of
jail" card from _me_.
