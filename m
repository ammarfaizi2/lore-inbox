Subject: ICH3 - Pentium-M : Timer tick problems in IOAPIC mode

Hi,
   I'm experiencing problems with the IOAPIC mode on a Pentium-M based
   board.

 Two symptoms show up:

  timer ticks stop after a little while, when this happens, activity on
  the serial console or local keyboard may unlock the timer tick and
  resume proper execution for a little while.

  timer ticks is unstable and accelerate, giving clock drift of 10% to
  500% depending on the board I/O load, especially serial and keyboard.

 Both the linux 2.4 and 2.6 series show this problem.
 Linux 2.4.22 (vanilla with SMP)  see attachement 
 Linux 2.6.5  (with SMP)	  see attachement 

 Hardware Summary:
 	Intel Pentium M, 
	Intel 7501 , 
	Intel ICH3 
	Winbond 83627HF
 
 My understanding is that ICH3 chip integrates  both the APIC and the
 timer, I noted that even in IOAPIC mode linux acknowledges the IRQ0 to
 the 8259 PIC, it seems possible that the linux code masks IRQ0 and
 doesn't unmask it but I couldn't find the location.
 
 This problem is more likely to show up when the "BIOS Legacy USB"
 support is enabled, this is an SMI source. 
 
 This problem never showed up in XT-PIC interrupt mode.

 If anyone experienced a similar problem, I'll be very glad to hear
 about it, as well as a possible fix or workaround. (other than disable
 apic).

 Thank you.
