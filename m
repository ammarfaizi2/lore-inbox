Where did you see anyone asking for more? People are worried, that they 
suddenly have less. If Larry is taking the ability away to extract 
information from the SCCS files, something has to replace this. Especially 
SCM developers are worried that they loose information, the Linux 
repository is a very valuable resource and since they can't use bk, they 
always depend on others to get to that information as complete as 
possible.

Well, all this reminds me a bit of a missionary trying to convert the 
pagans to the one true god and all the true believers can't understand, 
why they don't want to be converted. If we could get our preacher to 
preach a little less, we all could live peacefully together. :-)

bye, Roman
