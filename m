Hi

Im writing (well porting) a driver for the INMOS G332 video chip

Just a quick ping to ask

1) Is anyone else doing this?

2) Is this of use to anyone in the MIPS community, where I believe these
chips are used occasionally?

The driver is for the Computer Concepts Colourcard on the Acorn Archimedes
(ARM machine)
