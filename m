The emu10k1 only generates interrupts when playing pcm sound.
The interrupt rate depends on the "fragment" size and is usually
smaller than ~1000interrupts/s (this is 256bytes fragment 48Khz sample 
rate, 16bit, stereo).

Is it possible there is another device producing these interrupts?
On-board devices (usb, ...) that you don't use?
Does this happen with this kernel only?

Which functions do you see listed? If it's only "emu10k1_interrupt()"
then the interrupt was not generated by the emu10k1.
