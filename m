butterfly:/home/glynis# modprobe usb-storage
modprobe: Too deep recursion in module dependencies!
modprobe: Circular dependency? ide-iops ide-io ide usbcore usb-storage
Aborted

this is a mostly scsi box with ide as module for the cdrom.  i'm going
to try to compile ide into the kernel to overcome this.

does anyone else have any suggestions?

thanks.
