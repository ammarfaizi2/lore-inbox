Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before this, but life got in the way.

OK, I've got the timeouts bumped up as you suggested earlier, and applied 
the patch from the 12th.  Both of these things together w/o any options
make the keyboard work again.

Yes, this _is_ a weird machine.  It's a laptop that is a true PS/2 (MCA
bus) from 1994.  All the rest of the hardware is "odd" as well, so why not
the keyboard?

If you want me to look at anything else, let me know.

Thanks for your efforts,
