   I have to agree with you. We need to apply for our own patients. The 
problem is it cost to lay down patents. Who is going to pay? 
  As for the  US Patent laws based on the constitution. That is no longer 
the case. The Patent laws where changed when NAFTA and GATT went into 
effect. Now the patent laws are changing again to meet WTO standards. The 
whole planet is moving over to one universal set of patent laws. Those are 
the laws to watch for. In fact India last month changed there own patent 
laws to match WTO requirements. The WTO is not going away and they have 
billons of dollars and world goverments behind them.
