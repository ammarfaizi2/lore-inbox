Just in case people have wondered about the recent kernel.org
slowness: we got unprecedented server load after Fedora Core 3 was
released, and it hasn't fully died down yet.  Additionally, the server
is starting to show its age.

We are actively working on getting new hardware; hopefully we should
have something new in place some time in December or January.
