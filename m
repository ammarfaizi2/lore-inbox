you're referring to the 2.5.0 kernel, i'm talking about the 2.4.15
kernel.

i swear, i am not making this up.  i just tried again, through mozilla,
to download the file 
www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.15.tar.bz2, and it 
completed after downloading *exactly* 155312 bytes, just as before.

getting it via ftp works fine -- it's http that's giving me this
weird problem.   is it just me?
