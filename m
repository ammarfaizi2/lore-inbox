Most of the GNU utilities were just clones of the work the AT&T did when 
the C language and the Unix operating system was invented. To clone an 
existing product is trivial as compared to coming up with the original 
ideas in the first place. RMS didn't invent C, he cloned it. If anything 
it should be called AT&T/Linux if you want to give credit to the 
innovators. RMS is just a middleman in the process.
