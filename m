please can we move this discussion _to_ the linux visionaries
mailing list?

i for one would actually like a place where linux kernel developers can
say, instead of "get lost, xxxxhead, you're wasting our time" or
patronise people with IQs > 140 with "go read the kernel newbies faq":

	"Hmm, sounds like you have a baad case of linux vision, son.
	Go Preach it on LVML, and may you ever love the Penguin."

anyone willing to host such a list at a _real_ server please
speak up now or forever hold your peace.
