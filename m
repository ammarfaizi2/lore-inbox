I would say kernel newbies is the place for that. It's a little less likely to 
be lost in the shuffle, and enough code wizards lurk there that if it's an 
idea of merit, they'll pick it up.

Alternatively, you could take a hand at coding it yourself. Kernel newbies is 
a good resource for you in that case as well.
