I was not able to because the Cherokee Nation had not fully completed
the planning stages and I did not have authority form our leaders to
discuss this until it reached this stage. Whether you or anyone stays 
with the GPL or not does not lessen your ability to contribute 
to our efforts.  I would invite you and anyone else who wishes to 
help us define a body of laws to promote open source and you are always
free to participate with us.
