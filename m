I wouldn't use a new release of Windows or OSF/1 or Digital Unix or
Solaris in a commercial situation and linux is no different.  In this
case [cmpci] it sounds like some user's desktop which is also asking for
problems.  Having it visible to management is just too much risk
regardless of the os. 

Stick with distribution OR 2.2.x (2.2.19pre2 or higher) kernels.
