True once upon a time (and people did this for IBM clone PC systems when
IBM tried that in graphics cards)

Once the phrase "Copyright, Lexamrk Inc." is checked to ascertain
permissions you are in the world of the EUCD and DMCA. You are
subverting a rights management system which places you on interestingly
vague ground.

EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is clearly a rights management systems. Thats one of
its little charms.
