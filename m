Hi, i would like to request the savage drm listed here;
--> http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/S3Savage

I was hopeing that it could be added as a selectable DRM module in the
kernel such as the ati rage and such are. This is a tested driver,
proven working for most, making it selectable in the kernel would be
very much appreciated and a great advancment for all savage users. The
savage users have for long been without opengl, now the time comes
when it can happen, i was sincerley hoping that this could be added
into the kernel. i was hoping it will become part in the list of
selectable DRM in the gentoo kernel, vanilla, etc.. whatever it is
easier to include it in. I would appericate a responce on your
thoughts, and im here for testing if needed.

Thanks
