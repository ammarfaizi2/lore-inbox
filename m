I agree completely with all you have said.  The problem is; how do
you secure compensation to the authors/producers while at the same
time still secure fair-use/first-point-of-sale issues to the consumer?
Not a trivial thing to do given digital information.

If a workable and 'good enough' solution is found, it might be just what
is needed to torpedo many of the abuses of DRM/DMCA.

By workable, I mean it is not so intrusive from the consumer's
perspective that he is discouraged to use the content in that form.

By good-enough, I am just putting a (what should be well known) stake
in the ground: there is no complete or absolute protection from
piracy.  Good enough means that such piracy as still remains is 1.)
of a small enough scale that it can be ignored (e.g. DVD piracy via
DeCSS today); or 2.) only of a nature that it can be successfully
addressed in another forum (e.g. DVD piracy as done by certain
China based companies.)

I am _very_ concerned with the direction of the judicial and legislative
climate in the USA at this time.  I do have some small experience in
security issues and would be interested in such a project.

I could write _much_ more on this topic - but I will wait to see where
this conversation goes first before boring/annoying LKML folks more
than I already have.
