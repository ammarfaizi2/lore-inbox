What arp packet size does a linux 2.4 series kernel use? How would it be
made bigger?

I'm having a problem where a cisco switch is ignoring me because (according
to the guys who operate it) the arp spec for 802.3 is 64 bytes and im not
doing that.

Im not subscribed to the list, so if I could be cc'd I'd appreciate it.

Hope someone can help me, and thanks for taking the time to read this.

Tim
