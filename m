Hello all,

I've been attempting to successfully configure my first kernel for the 
past at least two (2) weeks if my memory serves me right. I got soem 
good help from a number of sources including LinuxQuestions.org. But now 
I've arrived at yet another critical bump in the road which I've not yet 
had resolved.

Basically, my new compiled kernel (2.4.22) always fails to determine ip 
information for my internet (via DSL) connection. This always works with 
my old installed kernel (came with RH 9.0) unless my ISP has a problem 
at the time and this is definitely not the case.

What confuration options or otherwise could be causing this?

Please advise.
Thank you.
