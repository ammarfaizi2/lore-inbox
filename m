Could to point me to mingos[1] memleak-detector? I need to know,
whats going on here.

I have had a load of 10 today, a much to busy disk and a full
swap.

I killed X and killed -9 netscape several times and waited a
while. Things didn't settle down until reboot.

So I definitly would like to try all that doesn't corrupt my fs ;-)

[1] If people wonder, why I ask about "my own" patch: Mike means
   Ingo *Molnar* (nickname mingo), which is NOT me (nickname ioe).

   I'm NOT going to change my name because of this, ok? ;-)
