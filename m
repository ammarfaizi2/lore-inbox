Excuse me, but I don't think that we can get computer temperature sensors as
we know them to measure temperatures of matter in quantum states.  Even if,
one day, we built a usable quantum computer which might need temperature
measurements, I doubt that the Linux kernel would run on it without being
totally rewritten.

Anyhow, I like the discussion.  I love anything to do with quantum physics!
