FYI vger rejects mail sent from yahoo.com, claims that it
has a HTML subpart and considers it spam or Outlook Virus.

FYI any mail sent from yahoo will end up using the yahoo tools
(qmail). This will put an empty HTML section in all mail. It
is not a good thing to reject this because that means you reject
all mail from yahoo.

I have gotten several messages of this kind by persons who are
not bold enough to report problems on their own. The last rejection
of which I speak was rejected from N26835@yahoo.com on april 2
