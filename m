419 spam mails in what timespan ? 

I get max. 1 per day which is really sent through the maillist. I guess
the list is hit by min. 5000 per day, so what. Want you really to bitch
about the one which slips through ?

Of course my spam filters / mail server get rid of dozens per day which
pretend to come from the maillist.
