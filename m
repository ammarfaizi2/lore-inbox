I think that the word "copy" may be a significant cause
of artificial disagreement here.  I, for one, find it just
as misleading as "free" (is it as-in-beer or as-in-speech?).

Larry -- would you be willing, in future postings of this
nature, to distinguish "duplicate" and "reimplement"?
(Perhaps someone else will find better, more obviously
different, words, but that's the best I can do today.)  If
you did this, at least the discussions about whether you
refer to copyright or patents would disappear.

Matthew.
