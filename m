Whhops,

Lots of discussion,
but this is what I like with Linux:
lots of people that know what they are talking about
commenting/discussing things.

Anyway:
- I am not running xfs, but I do run resiserfs.
- I also have the ck2 patch that includes the low latency patch,
  could that be it?

My patch got rid of the messages and my laptop behaves again,
but really I think that there is something fishy going on,
the messages shouldn't happen....

I am leaving it in your hands guys, as I don't have the experience
nor the time to go get this one.

BRGDS
