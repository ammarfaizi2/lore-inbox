Greetings folk.... I'm wanting to scan the LKLM archives for a series of
posts that are stuffed in my memory somewhere. Is there a location that
provides gzipped copies of LKLM coverying say 3 years?

I've found http based archives on cs.helsinki.fi but not an ftp equiv thus
far. If anyone has these or can point me to a location, it would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

-jbl
