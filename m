The easiest, no need to talk to a lawyer, most economical, way out of
this is to simply make all source code open and published under the GPL
or GPL compatible license with the appropriate "signed-off" entries.

As soon as you start trying to release some part of it as binary code,
then lawyers have to be involved and that tends to cost a lot more.

People on this list are NOT lawyers, so don't ask about that option on
this list.
