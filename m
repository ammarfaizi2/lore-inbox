In terms of above statement, yes. It actually needs means to seriously
control the EPO and national POs - there absolutely no independent
justice (similar to other democratic systems) there.
Nevertheless the evil propaganda was working since years to get the
decision makers (read: law and politics folks with (almost) no knowledge
of "programming", "software" and/or copyright/author's rights) to
believe in "monopolies on ideas are good for small companies".
And there are other forces pushing in that direction but without prove
I won't speak about it ....

they are "legal" (since they are granted) - even there are severe
concerns (read: there are not fulfilled in any way) about the
preconditions.
However the POs get more money from granted patents than from not
granted ones (for actually less work - for the patent proving person it
is more work to seriously explain a declined patent instead of - more or
less - simply accepting it) and the POs have absolutely no risk. Guess
what will happen .....
