Actually it'd be quite simple so long as they don't want to support NT 
based systems. Linux distributions in various shapes and sizes did it 
for years, and there is no doubt some that still do it. All you have to 
do is add a shortcut on a windows desktop that reboots it to MS-DOS 
mode and runs LOADLIN.
However I find this unlikely, esspecialy with NT-based desktops 
becoming more common, be it Win2k or XP.
Plus the journalist obviously doesn't have much technical background, 
so for all we know he took what sources told him and inverted it, 
reversed it, inverted it again, and then ROT13'd it to get the final 
result.
