Personally, I'm annoyed that Reverse Engineering is so frowned upon that 
stupid laws get passed to block it, and that the practice is misrepresented 
by the media.

I think degree programs for Computer Science and Engineering at Universities 
across (at least) Europe should run reverse engineering courses for those 
interested.

Assembler and the ability to read machine code is becoming a forgotten skill, 
and it's the only way that we can help negate vendors' "anti-choice, 
anti-consumer" attitude.
