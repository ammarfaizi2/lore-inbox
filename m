Hola,

Looks like I have the same problem that was discussed here in February 
with PCI resources being assigned to the same range as RAM.  This is the 
old thread: "IBM Thinkpad G41 PCMCIA problems [Was: Yenta TI: ... no 
PCIinterrupts. Fish. Please report.]"  I'm having this problem on 2.6.11.

Did the patch for this ever make it into the main kernel?  Is it still 
in the -mm tree?  Will it ever be in the main kernel?  How do I figure 
these things out?  Is there some bug database I can check?

Thanks.
