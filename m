I am pleased to announce that xcvs has reached its late beta
release v0.2.1.

http://xcvs.sourceforge.net

Xcvs is a web-based CVS tracking tool. Each commit (check-in) to a CVS
repository is viewed as one logical, coherent change.  The web interface
allows one to query the changes by branch, author, date/time, and etc.,
and view each change as a patch file.

Please redirect future discussions about xcvs to the xcvs mailing list, 
xcvs public forum or directly to me.

Thanks for your attention.

Jun
