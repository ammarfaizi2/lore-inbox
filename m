Huh?  This ideology in my books.

Linus has tried other SCMs.  They did not suffice.   I remember the preBK
days, when you had to post a patch half a dozen time to get it merged.  
Patches were being missed left right and center.  This changed after BK.
We _are_ getting large benefits from BK.  They may be hard to see at our
side of the keyboard - but I believe Linus when he says BK is the best 
tool for him.  That this probably will not be the case for ever.  Think
it still is for now though.
