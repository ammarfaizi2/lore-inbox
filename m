I use djbdns myself and am very happy with it, but the original poster was
asking for free software. djbdns doesn't even meet the DFSG/OSD, let alone
the FSF definition of "free software". Please refer to the archives of the
dns@lists.cr.yp.to mailing list if you're interested in seeing all the old
arguments.

If you're looking for a GPL'd DNS server, there's Mindspring's DENTS
project, although it hasn't seen much development lately:

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/dents/

That being said, none of this is on-topic for linux-kernel.
