 The point being made (I believe) is that recently the "released"
kernels have had a low quality with showstopper-quality bugs being
introduced, but not detected,  very late in the -preX cycle. What the
initiator of this thread wants is a longer testing of the last -preX
version. And changes between that an the "release" confined to bug/doc
fixing *only*. Whether this has to be under the "-rcX" label, or not -
the idea behind it is sound.
