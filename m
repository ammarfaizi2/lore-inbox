Hi All,

1> Could somebody suggest me the way to protect floppy from copying it's
contents. 
2> If not possible, will it be possible to make the copied floppy unworkable
(The copied floppy shouldn't work).  
   For this I have constraint, I don't want to change the platform, which
reads this floppy.


The contents of the floppy could be anything like text file, exe file or
encrypted file.

Regards,
Pravin.
