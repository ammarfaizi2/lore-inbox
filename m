Just a me too here.  I have been using 2.5-mm kernels for about the last 10 or
12 revisions and I thought it was good when I started but WOW, it is really good
now.  It seems all of the AS bugs have been ironed out as I haven't had any odd
OOPS or hangs, and under even a serious load it still runs like a champ!
