I'm interested in production systems, and that means staying with 2.4 for a 
LONG time from now.  So your code for 2.4.x is very relevant to me and 
that's why I was asking..

Is the Promise Ultra133TX2 supported with 2.4.18, or do I need to patch in 
your major ATA upgrade? (Which I assume is still a patch and not included in 
the mainstream kernel?)

Thanks!
