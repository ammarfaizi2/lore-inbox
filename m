Netscape is bad news for patches, both sending and receiving.  On send
it wraps lines and doesn't let you see the wrapped version until after
it's sent - on receive it likes to convert tabs to spaces.  Avoid.

I haven't tried mozilla yet.  I should, because if Mozilla is similarly
broken at least we can fix it.

Kmail works fine.
