It's an implementation of Domain Enforcement, ported
from the flask project. It is a prototype. 

Persons looking for backdoors, tricks, traps, snares,
or ice are going to be disappointed. It's just code

by employees of the NSA. They should be applauded for
the effort they put in just to be allowed to make this
available.
