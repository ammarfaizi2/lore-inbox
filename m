Hey guys,

I last posted a problem regarding ACPI and shutting down the system. I believe the 
suggestion was for me to upgrade the kernel. With kernel 2.6.3, ACPI shutdown was 
working about 90% of the time but once I upgraded to 2.6.4, it never shut off again.

If anyone can tell me where I need to go for to correct this, I would really 
appreciate it. I've already tried one of the ASUS mailing lists but it's as dead as a 
ghost town.
