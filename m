Really. I must be mis-remembering some of the comments made about
reiserfs 3 during the 2.5 to 2.6 period.

You were not first on the block. Linus was, thats why it's Linux (well
not directly his fault about the name) and why he sets policy. I've
never heard Linus espousing such an idea so I wonder why you think that
way. Rather I've heard Linus tell groups of people with differing ideas
about interfaces to go figure it out first and build the right interface
then come back with a consensus (for example with SELinux)

Why would that be "odd". What are you trying to imply and why not just
say it if you actually have something to say.
