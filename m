It is done from your point of view but not mine. You expect people
to find bugs and report to you. I expect the bug to be fixed and 
the solution be given to me. See the difference ?

Look I'm not a luser, I do maintain several projects myself, so it's
not like I'm talking of osmething I don't fully understand. When someone
reports a bug, even if I can fix and test the fix myself, I do have
the respect to let the reported know it is fixed, and how and when he
will get the fix.

Thanks for pointing me to the right thread then.

If the final point is that you just *don't want'* sending an announce mail
(either here or on your own linux1394-announce) than I think it is clear
why we had all this thread.

I never said that, and you know it. But it is part of maintainer job to
answer to criticism and be open to suggestions.

I don't think there is anymore to get from this discussion, so let's end
it there.
