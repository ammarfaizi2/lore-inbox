Linus, I think I hear people you said you trust telling you this... take
the little bits out of band and TRUST people to give you patches which go
in 2.5.x now, not when or if you get to it. Having you approve trivial
stuff is a waste of what you do best, and I think all the versions show
you're not even being effective at that. Don't you HATE looking at
spelling errors, off-by-one logic, corner cases, and stuff like that? Farm
it out and let other people do it, and work on the fun stuff.
