Okay,

If I am wrong I can step up and freely admit it. :-)

If nothing else I got one point for getting you to point out you like OSL
which I do also.

So given RMS and company state OSL and GPL are not compatable, how does
the two exist in the current kernel?  Earlier, iirc, there were comments
about dual license conflicts.

I was actually trying to show how silly David's arguement was about
imposing bogus rules and taking it to the logical ends of insanity. It is
lonely out here, I need more people to go over the edge on the
bobsled too.

Cheers,

PS: I am not attached to the the flame war any more, I just enjoy the
warmth of the heat :-0
