*grin* SCSI drives last a long time and have long warranties.  IDE drives
fail often and have short warranties.  It all averages out.  The point is
how often do you send a drive back?  With IDE, it's all the time.  With
SCSI it's rare.

Case in point, how many SCSI drives have been bad right out of the box vs.
IDE?  In my experience, I've never had a bad SCSI drive from the get-go.
I currently have one Maxtor waiting to be sent back.  And 2 out of 16 for
a 1G array were defective at powerup.  (2 more failed within a week.)

Which is cheaper... asprin and shipping charges, or going SCSI from the
get go? (I know, but I don't like headaches! and the lovely Caen Raptor
line makes things way too expensive for my boss.)
