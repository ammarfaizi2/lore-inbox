I do not think there is a miscommunication here. First, someone gets an 
e-mail saying that your message "waits for moderator's approval". Then 
you get a message saying that your "message was rejected by the 
moderator because you are not subscribed to the list".

Mind it, those were bug reports, not spam. I took your beta code, tested 
it, saw real bugs and problems and wrote bug reports  BECAUSE YOU 
INCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO SO AND GIVE THOSE EMAILS IN THE DOCUMENTATION!!!

There is no place in the source tree docs that say the list is 
moderated.  It it had said so, I would have not wasted my time. I felt 
really pissed off for waisting my time. BTW, other e-mails given in the 
documentation just bounce. If you do not want people sending bug 
reports, update your documentation. It is not polite to make people 
waste their time!
