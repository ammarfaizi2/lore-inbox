Andre, you just made the point i've been thinking of for
some time.  Let the people who object to having an interface
for binary-only modules stake out their code.  If you have
no code you have no legal standing.  Identify what code you
won't allow the binary modules to use.

I'm a lurker here.  I just don't feel very itchy.  But if
someone actually declares needed code off-limits for the
binary modules i and others could very quickly develop
serious itches to scratch.  The patch-war will be people
replacing code belonging to the extremists.
