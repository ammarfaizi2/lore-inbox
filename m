Subject: AGP not supported in 2.4.x ?

  . .[ ]   Generic SiS support                                            . .

Got a new MSI 655 FSIR motherboard..

Checked this option:

  . Note that 5591/5592 AGP chipsets are NOT supported.                     .

This is one of the most powerful motherboards out there under $300
IS anyone working on developing a driver for this chipset?

Time to run windows?

It is a GeForce4 Ti 4800 SE , the fastsest gdf4 and the video is so slow it can bearly play 160x120 realplayer video off the hdd.

Any news on this chipset?
