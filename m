Roman, I'm not going to bother fighing your idiotic issues any more.

The data is all there, and has been there since day one. That's what the 
patches are, that's what the tar-balls I do are, and that's what the 
snapshots that others do are.

All there. Since day one.

Go away now.

Absolutely. And I do.

What's so hard to understand with the single sentence:

	"Don't complain about other peoples licenses."

And no, it has _nothing_ to do with the GPL vs BK. It's a general truism.  
The fact is, developers can choose whatever license they want for their
own code. And users can choose whatever program they want, as long as they
follow that license. And it's _their_ decisions.

But I don't. If you don't like BK, use the tar-balls. It's exactly the 
same source tree.

And no, if you don't use BK, you can't use the BK tree. Well DUH! 

And if you want to go write your own SCM, and use your own SCM for doing 
your own Linux development, be my guest. But stop whining about choices 
that OTHER people made, and that you don't have anything to do with.

As it is, you're nothing but an uninvited religious nut at my door, trying
to convince me on your nut-case religion. Sorry, I'm not buing it. *BLAM*
