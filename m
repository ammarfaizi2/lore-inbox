Have fun! Great that you do this.

Usually it should be removed.

The way to remove 2.4/2.2. code is by reimplementation
of 2.6-APIs in seperate files and headers and not submitting
these into latest kernel. Keep these somewhere else 
(e.g. a project web site).

That way your drivers ALWAYS work with latest kernels
and you notice breakage of backward compatiblity quite easily.
If maintaining these parts becomes a pain with no gain, 
you can simply stop providing these yourself.

"#ifdef KERNEL_VERSON" stuff in submitted drivers
is generally not acceptable. Since it is hard to test these parts.

I ported some off-tree drivers from 2.2 to 2.4. using this technique
and it works good, reduces maintainence burden and keeps
your driver current to latest APIs automatically.
