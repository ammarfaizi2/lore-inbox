Hi Adrian,

I have only now had time to read your patch and reject most of it --- the 
email addresses in the revision histories etc are for historical purposes 
and as such are very useful. They are NOT meant to be valid except at the 
moment of time when they are written. The only purpose of email address in 
the revision history is the indication where the person worked _at the 
time_.

The only bits that should be made sure to remain valid are the 
MODULE_AUTHOR, as Arjan also mentioned.

Also, it is very strange that I have _not_ received your original email 
containing the patch --- I only saw it now via lkml archive.

Kind regards
Tigran
