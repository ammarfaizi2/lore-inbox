Andre - 99% of the BSD developers are sane reasonable people. They have
their kooks we have ours. Since both headers appear to be representations
of a third party datastructure the matter is also completely irrelevant.
I would suggest folks read up a little on copyright law with regard to
interfaces and definitions.

Now if Arjan did copy the stuff by reference to the BSD drivers, then no
he didn't do anything wrong - but I agree it would have been polite to have
duly credited it. It would also have been polite if the BSD person concerned
had contacted him privately and asked too
