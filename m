Hmm.  With all due respect, I think that arguing business with someone
who has yet to be sucessful at it is not likely to help me or help the
open source world.  I think you have some really interesting thoughts and
it's clear that you have thought hard about this stuff.  I'm also someone
who has thought hard about a lot of things I haven't done only to find
that my opinions changed dramatically once I started doing those things.
Theory and practice and all that.

No offense intended, but I'll pass on this for the time being.  I look
forward to watching you create and run a business based on your principles.
If it's successful, who knows?, maybe I'll be working for you one day and
that would be cool, I'd love to work for someone with a better vision.
