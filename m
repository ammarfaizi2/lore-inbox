Well, nabble sends an alert mail to my gmail account whenever there is a
reply to the thread I monitor accompanied by a second message that is
'coming' from the author of the reply and a CC to
linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org. So I use gmail only for reading the replays.

In the Reply form used by nabble one can find the following

so I assumed that nabble will do proper posting to the mailing list. It
appears that it does not.

I will use gmail with 'Reply to all' from now on in order to post messages. 
Sorry for any inconveniences.

Regards,
Horia
