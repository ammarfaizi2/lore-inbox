I don't quarrel with the fact that you assert that. However, it does 
not follow from Alan's statement.

And if non-rebellion by a citizenry against immoral behavior by its

Jefferson in a slightly different context, " Indeed I tremble for my 
country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot 
sleep forever."
