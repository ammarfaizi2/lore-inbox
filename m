Hi,

Sorry about the last report not the most informative, I'm still getting a 
kernel panic with 2.5.40. I think it's my Alcatel USB Speedtouch Modem as it 
only panics when I plug it in.

I set up a serial console but I could get the oops I could log in but as soon 
as I plugged in the modem it hung.

So I wrote what I could see by hand

With 2.5.39 the call trace was same plus the following

kmem_cach_free
do_exit
sys_exit
syscall_call

and the process was usbmodules

attached is config, lspci and lsmod from 2.5.36 with same config
