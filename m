No.  The docs in question are covered by the GPL.

This is part of where I get the censorship jag.  The doc _license_ is
GPL, so they are clearly complaining about my GPL'd speech describing
proprietary software.  Fsck them, I will talk about proprietary software
as much as I like.  And GPL that speech, as much as I like.

Implying (or flat out saying) that _talking_ about something proprietary
makes that speech proprietary is silly.

Daniel was trying to dictate what we can and cannot talk about, in the
kernel sources.  That's offensive.
