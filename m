Jörg, can you read English properly?  Did you read what he wrote at  
*ALL*?  This is EXACTLY why people have been flaming you on this  
list.  He just wrote in sufficiently graphic detail how he doesn't  
care what FreeBSD does.  You promptly replied with a description of  
FreeBSD.  ARE YOU READING WHAT WE TYPE?!?!?!

This is it, I give up; you cannot have a reasonable discussion on  
this list and therefore are only contributing to the noise.  Plonk!

Cheers,
