Let me try to move this discussion out of the various hidden corners of
the blogosphere and into the open, because it is an important one.

The characterisation of this as a "problem" is incorrect.  In fact, I
see this as just another of the many strengths of the open source
process.  He who owns the copyright controls the code.  The object of
the Linux development process is to produce the best and most
technically excellent kernel we possibly can, not to produce a piece of
code that's owned by some individual person or entity.  Thus, it seems
to me to be the essence of fairness that each individual contributor to
Linux owns their own copyright and hence the kernel itself is owned by
all its contributors in proportion to their contribution.

This is a structure and it serves two purposes

     1. It franchises every contributor to the kernel.  Anyone who ever
        submits a patch for anything can point to their contribution and
        know they own it.
     2. It prevents anyone taking control of the project via the
        mechanism of copyright ownership.

That is correct.  It would be a very time consuming and arduous process,
but it could be done.

That's fine and dandy for as long as you trust the FSF stewardship of
the copyrights.  If we'd signed over the Linux copyrights to the FSF, it
would give us all a warm glow to know that the kernel was going v3
regardless of the views of its contributors.

Fundamentally, I far prefer the trust nobody franchise everybody
approach which is the current state in Linux.

Again, this is an issue of trust:  Nearly a decade ago, the then Linux
developers didn't trust the FSF enough to accept whatever GPLv3 would
turn out to be sight unseen.  Whether this was the correct course of
action is open to debate, of course.  However, any good lawyer always
tells you to read a contract or licence over before signing or accepting
it ... which is violated by the "or later" wording.

That's not necessarily true.  If v3 had simply fixed the three known
issues in v2:  Bittorrent, termination and patent licence as v2 plus
additional permissions, then the resulting licence would have been v2
compatible.  It's the additional restrictions that v3 is insisting on
that introduce the fundamental incompatibility with the v2 "no
additional restrictions" requirements.

But, for the reasons given above, I think it is in the correct position.
Changing the licence is like invoking great power ... and invoking great
power should be fundamentally hard otherwise people want to do it at the
drop of a hat.  Since we have to secure the agreement of every copyright
holder, it will be difficult and take a long time.  On the other hand,
if there's a great impetus to do it (like some of the situations you
cite above) then I think we could all rally around.

How can you lecture about freedom and then in the next breath turn
around and demand a controlling structure?  True freedom is also freedom
from control; and I think the franchise all Linux mechanism comes far
closer to this than the centrally controlled FSF one.

I'm really sorry, but this is democracy in action: in order to relicence
linux, *you* have to convince every copyright holder that it's the right
thing to do.  You can't wring your hands and say "convincing people is
too hard, we'll just wave the magic wand of control and make the problem
go away" because we don't have one (deliberately).  Nor can you blame
"the linux developers" for not having a correct licensing policy.  Code
only goes into the Linux kernel on its merits after it has been argued
for in a review the same is true of the Licence ... get on with
convincing people and arguing for GPLv3.
