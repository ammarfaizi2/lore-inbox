I seem to remember a feature in the kernel that allows each uid to mlock a small number of memory pages specifically intended to be used by daemons that cache keys. It is possible this was a Fedora kernel patch and not in the mainline kernel.

Maybe you meant something else, but history has shown that 'rolling your own' mechanism is a bad idea.

Are there even any suitable algorithms in the kernel??
