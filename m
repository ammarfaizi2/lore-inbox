Perl is pretty useful for code generation and/or parsing, e.g. in order to 
find mistakes you did or to build the thing you've created. It can also be 
used to convert code. Thus I wouldn't say it's useless in an 
multiple-platform multi-year environment.

That's true, but no reason to eat people for breakfast coz they do use 
debuggers to get beyond where code does what wrong.
