You have spoken . . . in a place where the kind of discussion you're
trying to have is completely off-topic.  This mailing list is for the
discussion directly relating to Linux kernel development -- not general
Linux questions, not Linux advocacy issues, and absolutely not anything
related to Microsoft.  Quit interfering with the intended purpose of
this mailing list.
