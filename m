Luckily copyright holders cannot define the scope of copyright
law.  This doesn't just include the (often illegal) EULAs of
proprietary software companies, but also the very strict
interpretation "some people" have of the GPL.

Both proprietary EULAs and the GPL have to work within the law
and cannot add anything illegal under the law.
