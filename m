The paper presented by Olaf Arkin (amongst other) points to some parts
of the linux code where this "vulnerability" exists.  I think Alan Cox
is working on some patches for his tree.  I wonder whether it's better
to null-pad  ethernet packets  or   to fill  them with  random  values
(possibly an overkill, but more resiliant against fingerprinting).
