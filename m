You make Linux better ? By providing closed source drivers and complaining 
that they wont compile everywhere ? HEHEHE

This statement reveals your deep unawareness of the social contract behind 
this community and the reality of forking since it started. 

Your swollen-headed self-pleasing nature makes you even resistant to sarcasm.

Thanks for providing a nice flame topic and now I have to go back and maintain 
some diverging non mainline kernel trees.

Hint: Maybe you should adjust your tie. See below.
