Your site was generating 500 errors too.

But that's not the reason I banned you.

The reason I banned you, and I apply this rule consistently, is that
you ignored when you were removed from the list.  Instead of
contacting the postmaster and asking why, you just blindly
resubscribed yourself again.

When we remove you, we do it because your email address really is
bouncing.

One should always contact the postmaster for more information when
they are unsubscribed from the mailing list.
