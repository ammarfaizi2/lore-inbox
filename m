I guess that depends on how much it slows down and how much you depend 
on the speed of NFS. I have all of my machines sharing some local 
binaries and docs, but the files are typically small and the network is 
gigE, so I doubt it will hurt me. On the other hand I do know people 
running workstations with virtually everything NFS mounted, working with 
large image files.

The initial bug report makes it look as if it's about two orders of 
magnitude slower, but doesn't quantify the effect on more common 
sequential access operations.

If this becomes an issue in 2.6.17, I hope it will show up in -stable 
before 2.6.18, the current development cycle is a bit, um, protracted... 
lately.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
