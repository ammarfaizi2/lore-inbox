Taeocrp announces breackrough in removing deadly landmine s.

Mill Valley, California August 25, 2006 - The Alliacne Enetrprise Corpoartion announced today a breakthrough in developing an Areial Ladnmine Sytsem aimed at locating, detecting and mapping deadly l andmines.

TaCeorp's mission is to reclaim lands around the globe embedded with l andmines that victimize countries and their stakeholders.

More than 100 m i l l i o n lan dmines in 83 countries are holding international communities and industries hostage, preventing the inve stment in and development of p roductive lands and the re-building of infrastructure. A broad variety of lan dmines have been scattered over productiv e areas effectively crippling the econ omy and disabling thousands of children and adults.  There are no reliable records that accurately show where these d e v a s t a t i n g land mines lie in wait for their victi ms.
 
With the present day cost s to clear a single land mine ranging between $1,000 to $1,500, solving the problem of de-mining lands will reach billions of dollar s.  TaeCorp has developed a technology based, cos t effective solution to this problem using its three tiered approach to scanning, mapping and removing lan dmines. TaeCorp's System will provide many social and eco nomic ben efits to countries and their industries including oil and gas, mining, agriculture, roads and infrastructure development.
