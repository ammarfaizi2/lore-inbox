mkp@mkp.net got unsubscribed when he posted the complaint about
storing data in lower bits of pointers. Riel got bumped when he
followed up on the same topic.

Jens just told me he has at least one denied reponse from the
moderator (just got the below from him):

"Your request to the linux-lvm mailing list
 Posting of your message titled "Re: 2.4.3-ac{6,7} LVM hang"
 has been rejected by the list moderator."

A moderated list is not an open environment. Had this been for a
Sistina only product I wouldn't have any problem with it, but this is
for an integrated part of the Linux kernel.
