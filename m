I think Al's work on the kernel speaks for itself.  He's been putting up
just fine, thank you.  And I think you're looking in the wrong place,
Al has expressed no interest (that I'm aware of) in rewriting this code.
As a user of the new system, a pretty typical user, his opinion counts.

I don't think that you're really getting the point.  Nobody is saying that
CML1 is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  What they are saying is that
it seems to work pretty well, yes it could be better, but CML2 isn't shaping
up to be an improvement so much as a Eric Raymond Language exercise.  Noone
begrudges Eric his right to come up with as many little languages as he wants.
But when he asks the kernel developers to use them, he'd better be prepared
to hear each and every thing they find wanting, and address the majority of
those issues.  That hasn't happened.  Instead, there have been a lot of 
flame wars, politics, protests about Linus, etc.
