Very interesting article.

I think it'ld be great to ask many people with different hardware to do 
the same kind of tests on different hardware to see the results.
I don't have the time time, but in a week or two I'll gladly run them on 
my computers if this can help.
(I've an Athlon 1.2G with 512M of DDR and an UDMA-66 hard disk)
But it'll be more interesting if the test "protocol" is somehow 
standardized. (and don't use commercial softwares, I don't own Oracle so 
I can't run a test needinf Oracle).

A linux user that want to give a small amount back in exchange to the 
great work you all do on Linux,
