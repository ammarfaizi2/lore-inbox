Much of what looks like rudeness in hacker circles is not intended to give
offence. Rather, it's the product of the direct, cut-through-the-bullshit

solving problems than making others feel warm and fuzzy.

"Whenever two people meet, there are really six people present. There is each
man as he sees himself, each man as the other person sees him, and each man
as he really is."  -  William James

"Thinking implies disagreement; and disagreement implies non-comformity; and
non-comformity implies heresy; and heresy implies disloyality -- so obviously
thinking must be stopped"
