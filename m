Well, see it as an evolutionary process. Of course you will always see
duplication as a try to re-invent something _better_. Anyway you will notice,
that evolution lives by the possibility to reuse and refine things that have
proven good.
It is a matter of time simply. It is no matter of black and white, rather of
darker and lighter grey. The more time the more the positive effects of the
"lighter grey" open source strategy (compared to "darker grey" closed source)
will take effect. See we are still at the very beginning of the "open source
age".
Since we all do not know what mission-critical questions for mankind will arise
in upcoming years,  we, too, cannot make claims about the resources needed to
solve - or at least survive - them. To me it is very clear that open source has
the capability to set resources free (see Larry: "will Sun survive the open
source") that can be very well needed in other important areas. This is not
bad, it is a chance. Reaching the same goal with less resources is never a bad
thing.
Just step back and watch the big picture, not only our "backstage area". A tool
can be very important, but you also need the people to use it for reaching the
right goal. Handing the car key to Homo erectus may not have been the right
thing to do, though the "car tool" itself is brilliant.
