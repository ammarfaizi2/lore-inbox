1. Reiserfs + 3Ware issue with 2.4.5
2. I'm building a rescue cd based on Timo's Rescue CD v. 0.5.4.  I've 
compiled the 2.4.5 kernel
to be a 386, all scsi controllers I might encounter compiled in, 
software raid, reisersfs compiled in.  The only modules are scsi tapes, 
network cards, nfs and smbfs support.

When I boot my K6II-350 Box (128 MB memory) off the cd, it boots up and 
eventually gets me to my prompt.  In the process the insmod of 3c59x 
gives me the following error:
/lib/modules/2.4.5/kernel/drivers/net/3c59x.o: unresolved symbol 
del_timer_sync

(This is just something I noticed along the way which is annoying but 
not a show stopper yet.)

The real issue is when after mounting my filesystems off the 3ware card 
and going to unmount them the following happens:

bash# umount tmp

/boot is ext2
/, /home, /tmp, /var, /usr are all reiserfs

------------------------------
As long as I don't retry to unmount the filesystem or unmount another 
filesystem the system is still usable.  But when I try to unmount 
another filesystem that process just appears to go into a never ending 
state.  Once I've locked up all my consoles I can only hit the reset 
button :(

ps ax shows:

51 tty3         SW      0:00 [kreiserfsd]
119 tty3        D       0:00 umount home

I can get to my other virtual console and still look into the currently 
mounted filesystems,
I just can't shutdown the box, kill the umount process, etc.  I can even 
look into the filesystem mounted as home that I am currently trying to 
umount as seen in the ps output.

The box is currently running a RH 7.1 system with a custom built 2.4.2 
kernel so I know reiserfs and the 3ware card work correctly before 
2.4.5.  :)

ver_linux shows (on my box that built the kernel):

I'm attaching my .config file if that helps.

I can't really provide more output from the test box as I am having to 
manually type stuff in on my other machine (in this email). :(
