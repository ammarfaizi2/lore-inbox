>From the desk of 
Mr. Mike Tulaman 
Metropolitan Bank Plc.  


Dear Sir/Ma

I am Mike Tulaman, the staff of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of the Metropolitan Bank Plc. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.

We discovered an abandoned fifteen million United States Dollars only ($15M) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Mr.Effat Mansour who died along with his of a wife Mrs. Virginia Mansour in October 31 1999 in a plane crash.  You can visit this link below (http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/).

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come forward and make claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the Fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin To the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, neither their neither family member nor distant relative has ever appeared to claim the said Fund.

Upon this discovery, my colleague and I have agreed to do this transaction with you and release the total amount into your account's as the heir to the fund since no one has came forward for it or knows he maintained account with our bank, otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed fund.

To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately indicate your Interest by a return e-mail stating your interest.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Regards,

Mike Tulaman
