Hi.

I would like to give it a try to contribute to the Linux-kernel.
And as many other beginners I look for a place to start.

Can any experienced developers give suggestions on code which is
unmaintained/bitrot and needs to be cleaned/fixed/foo?


I am open for all kinds of suggestions, as long as it does not include
buying hardware :)


TIA

/A
