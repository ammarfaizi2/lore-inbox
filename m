This was added in a previous kernel that I have not tested until now,
however it causes a rather noticeable problem when attempting to run,
well, most programs that heavily use futexes.

When running zinf (an mp3 player) I was getting the following at a rate
of 32 times a second, flooding the console well past the point of being
completely and utterly unusable.

zinf 0 waking zinf: 28254 28254
Badness in try_to_wake_up at kernel/sched.c:722

This is an Athlon XP 1700+ (not overclocked) on an ECS K7S5A, however a
large number of people have reported the same problem, so I doubt it is
hardware related.

My config is also attached.

I've always taken the position that if you can't find anything bad  to
say about a language or an operating system then you don't  understand
it. I also agree with you about the advocacy. AHS. ASS.
