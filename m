I believe it would only be prudent to actually send out these messages
starting at the moment ECN is officially standard.

This was the big argument I was running into from sites, "well it
isn't standard yet, when it is we'll do something about it".  The
larger sites like to avoid updates until absolutely necessary.

If we are to improve ECN deployment, we should understand the
priorities of the people who run the sites which stand in the way
of our doing so.
