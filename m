Did the numbers track add-on prices, as opposed to base server?  Most
servers are sold with one CPU and lots of extra slots.  Need to dig
down to the add-on data to find upgrades to more CPUs and more memory
in the field (and more disk drives).

Proprietary data, unfortunately.  And I'm not sure if even internally
the totals are rolled up as pSeries, xSeries, zSeries, iSeries, etc. and
broken down by linux/aix/NT/VM/etc.  Nor do most big companies efficiently
track the size of a machine at a customer site after hardware upgrades
(I know for Sequent this in particular was a painful problem - sold a
two way and supported an 18-way machine later).
