Hello,

after upgrading from test9 to test11, skipping test 10, I get 
the messages "_isofs_bmap: block < 0", "_isofs_bmap: block < ..."
which also means I can't read the cd.

I hope I don't missed a flag in the new kernel configuration.

I will attach the configuration file which works fine with test9 and
brings the error messages schown above.

greeting
  Jörg
