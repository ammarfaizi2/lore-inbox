I'd like to apply for funding from the EU, because I have the impression 
that they would like to fund things like linux kernel research and they 
have a lot of money in the budget for such things.  This would mean 
being brain drained to the EU, but hey, Europe is a nice place for the 
most part....

I have been reading through their funding literature, and they want to 
fund consortiums of entities from 3 different member states.  I would 
like to find appropriate partners for namesys.uk, and create a consortium. 

Linus, I imagine this won't interest you, but please issue such 
instructions on the matter as you choose if you have any time and 
interest for this.  If you'd like to be brain-drained to the EU let me 
know....;-)

The premise would be that we are developing the linux kernel in a free 
software collaborative effort that is open to all Europeans to 
participate in and that furthers the European national interest.  A 
better linux kernel will substantially reduce the cost of EU 
e-government while providing its citizens with an open infrastructure.  
Unless they are crazy, if we form a substantive consortium with serious 
proposals, they will give us large amounts of money.;-)

Readers are warned, it takes more than one ream of paper to learn how to 
apply, so the process is not for the casual.

http://europa.eu.int/comm/research/fp6/index_en.html has the reams of 
paper you'll need to read if this interests you.
