Btw, I tried that wit the code I had, it didn't work. It might depend on 
the person you're working with. I was told "We need your assignment on 
file". Some maintainers might be more careful.

I have been told that legally, "putting something in the public domain" 
isn't actually really possible in the US, but maybe that is something that 
lawyers disagree about.

You can assign or transfer your copyrights (in writing, on real paper 
only!) or you can license it, but "public domain" seems to be hard. Unless 
you just want to wait for several decades after your death (and that's 
hoping that Disney doesn't extend it even more after you die).
