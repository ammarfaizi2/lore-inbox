It works PERFECTLY under WinME, when WinME decides that it wants to work,
anyway.  If you ask me, $90 for just working sound (and a pretty crappy
rest of the system) is too much.  It was a complete waste of
money.  Although it did allow me to download the slackware ISO so that I
could put some Linux back on here when I got my new hard drive, Since
Win2k stopped running when I upgraded to 30gb from 4gb.

The mixer under WinME also seems to actually respond better, I get the
full capability of the Maestro mixer under WinME.  If I turn it all the
way up under Linux, I still have to turn the speakers damn near all the
way up just to hear it with my baseline on the subwoofer.  That's not my
concern tho, since I can compensate with the speakers (they have an
excellent amp on them).
