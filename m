Hallo Richard,

I just installed kernel 2.6.8.1, 2.6.9 and 2.6.9-bk7 and encountered
several problems:
(boot prompt:
vmlinux root=/dev/sda4 console=ttyS1,115200n8 console=tty0
I hope that is right this way)

1) 2.6.8.1 after fb-console is up no further messages will appear on
serial console

2) >2.6.9 (maybe >2.6.8.1-bk? not tested) __ioremap is missing in
include/alpha/io.h
following got deleted between 2.6.8.1 and 2.6.9 
# define __ioremap(a,s) alpha_mv.mv_ioremap((unsigned long)(a),(s))

the only source that uses __ioremap on my system is the framebuffer
(radeonfb), so that's not a so big problem for the moment ;-)

3) >2.6.9 (maybe >2.6.8.1-bk? not tested) 
srm console during aboot goes from white on blue to red on blue coloring
and freezes ( couldn't find info on that effect)
more than 10-20 oopses scroll by on serial console
(I'm using minicom and I've no idea how to log them to a file. I'm not
quite familiar with minicom, and the last time I used a terminal
software is minimum 8 years ago still using Windows resp. DOS
commandline ;-)  so it would be nice to use something like
setserial .... ; cat /dev/ttyS0 > ~/debug.log
can make it work this way???? )

I would appreciate any kind of help
Alex
