As the one who made the comment that Alan (tongue in cheek,
i hope) reacted to, let me say that your posts have been
welcome except when someone is pushing your buttons.  When
the topic has been about code your comments have been
informative.  Perhaps if the BK and licensing flame-fests
are interdicted things will become a bit more pleasant for
you.
