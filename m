That's not the issue... The issue is that there isn't a direct link to 
download the 2.6.12 source from www.kernel.org homepage... However, the 
-rc patches need to be applied against 2.6.12, so this should *really* 
be linked to from the kernel.org website, in a place that is easy to see 
without too much trouble. (perhaps, directly above, or directly below 
2.6.12.x)
