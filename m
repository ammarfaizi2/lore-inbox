They are stealing by changing GPL files, and not giving the source, its not for personal use so they are DISTRIBUTING it, and INCLUDING IT. BUT they dont give out their DERIVED source. I work with C everyday and when you put in a header file you are including it, all kernel headers are GPL. I read the license 4 times a day and have since 1995.

        First off, could you please your MUA to use 80 columns? having to 
manually put in carriage returns to read your mail gets rather tedious...

        I know why the GPL exists.. however, that does not mean or indicate 
that a company could not use the GPL for their own reasons. They a) wrote 
their own code, b) may have used headers that were GPL'ed, but does not mean 
or insinuate that just because they use GPL'd headers that they must have 
their SOURCE open. Many companies use GPL'd material, for their own purposes, 
and not have to have their own personal source open. You may want to read into 
the actual documentation for the GPL and LGPL.

        Besides.. Who is an honest contributor who worked on NVidia's own 
module? Did anyone outside NVidia write it? no. NVidia wrote it, NVidia 
released it, it's NVidia's IP. you're confusing Headers with the actual code.

        Like Snoop Dogg said. If you don't like it, don't buy it.

                                                        BL.
