Aren't you concerned with all of the trees that will be cut down to
make that paper, though?

I think 1 tree = about 50 reams.  Let's say you get through a ream a
day, that's a tree every couple of months!

Maybe there is a way to encode the data in the rings of the tree while
it's still growing, that would be the ultimate WORM device :-) :-)
