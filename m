What _exactly_ does this mean? Can you elaborate more on your setup and your
problem?

Ok, here we have about 2 dozen possible setups (drawing a narrow line), and
nobody will waste time to think about it, except me, as I feel a bit cast away ...

is it:
1) linux with vmware and guest system linux
2) linux with vmware and guest system bsd
3) linux with vmware and guest system w*ndooze (version make-my-day)
4) w*d*s with vmware and guest system linux
...
