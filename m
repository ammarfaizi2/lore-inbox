2 hours ago, my box was running a SuSE distro, kernel 2.6.5. Root
partition of 36GB reiser
formatted. 

I've built 2.6.9-rc3 with reiser support. The kernel build went fine.
Fired off the new kernel
from GRUB. Sadly, i get a lot of errors presumably from reiser code.
the only info i managed
to grab from the console is below

"Buffer I/O error on device hda2, logical block 9503423"
"The problem has occured looks like a hardware problem. blah, blah, blah......"

*SNIP*

bread: Cannot read the block (9503423): (Input/output error). 

*SNIP*

Then i am dropped to a root shell to run fsck.reiserfs, which of
course, did not help.

Did i miss some crucial configuration step ? or did the reiser
journals get corrupt
or something ?

I booted back to my SuSE kernel & things were fine.

.config attached.

TIA guys.
