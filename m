Patent law in the US is based on section 113 of the United States 
Constitution, and patents
are not going away.  Live with guys.  The best way to win the patent 
wars is for people
who do Linux development to file their own patents and put some stakes 
in the ground.

You guys keep saying, "stop the patents" but this is insanity.  It's 
like all these big companies
used patents like swords and are hemming linux in, and Linux stands 
naked and defenseless.
You guys need to get your own swords and fight -- start filing patents 
-- go to this new law
center "Southern Poverty Law Center" they setup I read about and get 
these folks to start
filing patents on Linux code (before you disclose it that is) and 
protect yourselves.  Then
you have ammo to negotiate cross patent agreements with MS and these 
other companies
to create a balance of power.
