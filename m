I realized after I sent that that maybe the point was too subtle.
Open source is great, I use it, I love it, no problem there.  However,
*if* I'm correct that what is happening is basically a process of copying,
and *if* open source kills off the companies producing the products which
are being copied, then open source slowly grinds to a halt in terms of
creating anything new.

That may well be fine in the minds of many.  Lots of people can't see
past their nose and all they want is free versions of what they have to
pay for today.  What's past their nose is all the new stuff we haven't
seen yet.  Imagine a world without that new stuff.  Just roll back the
world to 5 years ago and think of what you would have lost.
