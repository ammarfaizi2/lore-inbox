  Not exactly by NSA itself. A bunch of files have in copyright comment:

    Director, National Security Agency.

  ...so this is the result of Becker's employment at NASA and government's
legal weirdness (no, I have no idea, why of all possible choices
"Director, National Security Agency" must represent US government for
copyright purpose).
