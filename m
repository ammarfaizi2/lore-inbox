Hi Andrew!

I'm not sure what you been by any known issues. At any time there will
be and are issues with any Oracle release and kernel release.

If you by issues are meaning: Is there a problem running 8.1.6 and 8.1.7
on 2.2.18, the answer is no.
If you for some reason have an issue with running Oracle on these
platforms, please open an iTAR with oracle at http://metalink.oracle.com

I hope this is of some help.
