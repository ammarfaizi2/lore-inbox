Yes.  Sorry for the confusion.

Should work now.

I see your point.  But I don't really like the current code that
uses the address from bind for sending.  Even though it works here
because the packet socket is symmetric wrt sending/receiving, it
is counter-intuitive for the socket API in general.

Indeed it is.

Thanks anyway.
