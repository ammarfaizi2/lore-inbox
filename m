I gather from the combination of what I read on Slashdot and what folks replied
here that the mirrors are actually lightly loaded, but Slashdot readers don't
know about them because they couldn't read the home page at
http://www.kernel.org that directed them to the mirror list.

So I posted the algorithm for calculating the URL to your nearest mirror on
Slashdot.  Maybe that'll help some
