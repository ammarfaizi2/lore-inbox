Hi,

It seems to be that some of the features for route,
ifconfig etc are deprecated in 2.4 kernel. Also 
iproute2 is recommended. 
1) So I want to know what all things are deprecated.

2) Any pointers to this new ipstack which documents
what all things are deprecated will be helpful.

Please mail me at venkatraghu2002@yahoo.com.
Cheers
Venkat.
