I think that you simply meant in your email to identify free software as
a cause for this paranoia.  I can kinda see the logic, and you might be
right.

But what I think what fired up many other readers (and me as well, until
I read your reply), is that your email reads like the solution is to
stop making free software/independant music/etc and just pay for what
we're offered.  After all, individual creations will only serve to increase
the paranoia of the corporations.

If you're offering that as a solution, you're far crazier than even the
most vicious anti-BK people have claimed.

A Pope has a Water Cannon.                               It is a Water Cannon.
He fires Holy-Water from it.                        It is a Holy-Water Cannon.
He Blesses it.                                 It is a Holy Holy-Water Cannon.
He Blesses the Hell out of it.          It is a Wholly Holy Holy-Water Cannon.
He has it pierced.                It is a Holey Wholly Holy Holy-Water Cannon.
He makes it official.       It is a Canon Holey Wholly Holy Holy-Water Cannon.
Batman and Robin arrive.                                       He shoots them.
