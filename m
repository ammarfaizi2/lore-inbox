Is that true now?  It used to be said (including by some people who I
trust on such matters) that the ascii graphic "(c)" -- as opposed to a
real c-in-a-circle character -- was _not_ officially recognized as
meaning "Copyright", and so one needed the actual word "Copyright", or a
real c-in-a-circle, for such notices to have some meaning.  However the
word "Copyright" alone is apparently enough.
