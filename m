Before you tell me "it was not so in the earlier versions!" I am tempted
to quote a famous russian proverb 

"whosoever remembereth the past shall have his eye plucked out" 

which, paraphrased into Linux kernel development would sound like:

"whosoever keepeth Linux kernel trees under CVS, his disk shall rot"

;)
