This means that:
The mail from 212.153.111.69 was rejected because of an administrative
prohibition - that host is blacklisted.

This is probably because it's an open relay.
See http://www.orbs.org/verify.php3?address=212.153.111.69

If you encounter other pieces of plain English would you would like
translated into... er, ... plain English, please don't hesitate to go away 
and ask somewhere more appropriate.
