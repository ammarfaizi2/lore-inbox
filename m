Not at all, I am saying if you are worried about such things, then start 
with projects that would not require a hardware crypto card to make i 
useable. I thought this was focusing on keeping laptops secure, and I don't 
know anybody that makes a crypto co-processor in the pcmcia variety. There 
are things you can do to harden the kernel against such things with out 
encrypting everything is site. My view on encryption is like chocolate, its 
good, to much will make you sick.......
