Of course at moment there are no signs of decreasing in Linux oriented 
market, but still:
- absolutely everything exists due to the users - if there are no users 
left then the "thing" is dead. Well, for Linux it is enough to have two 
users, e.g. IBM and SGI and current development model (example of finest 
OS > simple usability) will end up just there.
In the other hand, of course, we do not want usable OS as example of 
biggest BS(tm). So somewhere in between should be the agreement. But if 
there are so many voices against then we are not in between. OK, voices 
are not equal in their strength :)
