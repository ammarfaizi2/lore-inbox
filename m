$50,000 per copy -- that's a hell of a pricetag. Windows only goes for 
$100.00 a copy.
You guys should be flattered.

Let's see, 10,000 companies x $50,000.00 a pop = $500,000,000 / year in 
license
fees. What a deal. 500,000,000 / 300 developers = 1.1 million per year 
for each of you.
Sounds like good business to me.

Companies will line up to do this, and what's great is you will still 
get new licensees every year,
so long as you keep ahead of the curve with innovation.
