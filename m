This is not the topic (I don't really care how the audio
recordings get merged or how the final recording is delivered
as RealVideo/RealAudio streams).  The topic is "how do we
get recordings of Linux-related discussions in the future 
that capture all the comments of the participants."  

It would be great if we could get a good approach nailed
down so that it could be used at Linux BOF discusssions
and development team presentations in the future.

OT: It would be great to have a central repository for Linux-
related audio/video streams.  For example, it'd be great to 
get some of the LinuxTag, LinuxWorld, Comdex, CBIT and other
presentations made available on the web.  Perhaps even more
valuable, from a development information dissemination 
standpoint, would be recordings of "birds of a feather" 
discussions.
