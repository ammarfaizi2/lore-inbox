Certainly, it is not.  This statement applies to Afghanistan, in that
the fact that they have not rebelled means they imply consent to
everything their government does, and therefore are just as guilty as
the Taliban.  Therefore, killing civilians (collateral damage) is no
worse than killing terrorists or Taliban officials.  This is a stance I
can easily subscribe to, not just with Afghanistan but with any people,
nation, state, or country.
