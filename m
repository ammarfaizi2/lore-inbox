I may have made a mistake in upload to sourceforge. 
I tried to upload both a compressed patch file and a compressed 
tar file for those that do not want to deal with patches. 
I think it should be Ok now.  
Jerrie could you download the patch from sourceforge and take a 
look at it to make sure it is OK.

Ok, we will do that too.
