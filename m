I almost missed the best laugh I've had in a while.  Thanks
so much.  I'm sure it wasn't intentional on your part and i
don't wish to belittle your poor English but you might wish
to work on it.  It is not my habit to make fun of the
mistakes of others.

I think he meant "everybody".  The word "everyone" would
have completely avoided the double entendre.  I should note
that in a draft you could be convicted.  Not every country
tolerates conscientious objectors and even the U.S. has
rather stringent requirements for that status.  And no, i
don't consider anyone who actually stands by such principles
when the going gets tough a wimp.
