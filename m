No, I haven't tried it yet.  I usually wait for things like this to be included
in Linus' or Alan's kernels before trying them.  In this case, I might have
tried it by now but I only have Python 1.5.2 on my system and don't want to
upgrade it until/unless it's absolutely necessary.  So I probably won't see CML2
until Linus puts it in 2.5.  My comments have been based on your descriptions of
it on lkml.
