Roman,

Freedom comes from keeping all of it free.
Litigation is a means to prevent the blanket theift of today.
You cleary do not get it.

How do you plan to stop people from making changes to the kernel,
packaging a binary kernel and selling it?

Clearly these people do not give a crap about the lame license you
believe.  So who will defend the recovery of the content for the OSC?
Your answer is the author.
My answer is the author may not be able to afford.

But it is all about freedom, what freaking MORON stopped the freedom with
GPL_ONLY?

Again you have never had your work stolen and needed to recover it for the
OSC.  Any of your poor bastards want to fund my legal attack to take a few
companies to court for GPL violations?

I did not think so.
