This type of invasive marketing is why people aren't going to be buying MS
products.  (Not al people, just those who choose.)  If you want to be a MS
user, they have you over a barrel, if you *have* to use MS products, they
have you over a barrel.  Some folks, myself included, have to use MS
products to get our work done.  Our employer gives us no choice, but when we
get home in the evenings, that choice is modified somewhat.  I have 2
desktop machines, one runs Redhat 7.0, the other Window ME.  I use them for
completely different purposes.  The WinME machine is used for stuff at the
office, the Redhat machine is my programming machine, also for the office,
(but they don't know that).  Windows users have a choice.  They can stay
where they are, or move on.  This means learning Linux, the Mac, or buying
into MS new licensing agreement.  I've made my choice.  That's why I'm on
this mailing list.  The best thing for users to do, is let MS be who they
are, and if they want to get into this licensing scam that MS is forcing on
them, so be it.  Be quiet about it, or at least complain to MS.  Their users
are going to have to force them to change their stance.  It won't come from
the linux-kernel mailing list.

microsoft != government.  the us constitution only applies to government,
not private industries, and certainly wouldn't help you, in canada.

you purchased it, meaning you wanted it.  nobody, except maybe your boss
made you buy it, and then you can always get a new job.  you have as much
freedom as you want, don't use ms products if you don't like them.
