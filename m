I don't think, one should learn all the "hot" languages of the day to
become a good programmer. A computer science student should (and will)
learn the theoretical background that lays beneath. Data structures,
graph theory, computational linguistics, compiler theory, OS, AI, so on.
Practical studies such as programming projects will let the students
solid the theory. These thoughts are not actually mine, most of the
computer science departments -more or less- follow a cirriculum
appreciating these ideas, I think. However, a kernel (or systems)
programmer should also know basics of microprocessors, interrupts, etc.
and programming in assembly, besides the theory given in a university.

After getting the theory and completing the understanding by practice,
learning a programming language is just a detail. Always solving
problems "C" style, may not be the best approach, a functional language
may better suit the needs -usually not in our course.

As far I could see, kernel programming (talking about the whole)
requires the use of computer science, heavily.
