Hmm, I guess it's a hit and run. I had replaced:

1. Fan assembly (was making grinding sounds after 1.5 years)
2. DVD-CDRW combo (Samsung SN-308B could not really read pretty much
anything but burns pretty well)
3. LCD (backlight burned out and I managed to tear connectors on the
panel trying to see if I can replace the light and what part shoudl I
order). Well, that helped to persuade my better half that I really
need 1600x1200 ;)
4. Original Hitachi hard driver died horrible death - I returned home
and heard it making grinding sounds and hitting heads against
something.
5. Replacement IBM drive has developed a few bad sectors, need to
arrange replacement.

But I guess all of it has something to do with being on 24/7. I am not
complaining, I like the box, especially the touchpad ;)
