JMODEM was done in 1989 as stated. RLE was invented my ME in 1967 and
was first used for a digital telemetry link between the Haystack research
facility in Groton, Mass. and MIT's main campus. I was a technician there
during my senior year at Northeastern. Whether or not it was patented
by others is immaterial.

FYI, there are a lot of things I invented that others patented.
The "Rubber Duckey" antenna (used in cell-phones and other
transceivers) comes to mind.

Even stuff, in which my name is mentioned as a "co-inventor"
ends up being attributed to others, i.e., Gordon, et.al.

 United States Patent 5,577,026
Apparatus for transferring data to and from a moving device.
 European Patent number 95906032.8-2206

This, where I not only invented it, but single-handedly
built it because the others mentioned in the patent were
nay-sayers, claiming it wouldn't work.
