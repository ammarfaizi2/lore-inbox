Hello,

Because I don't know which maintainer to write I write to this list.

When I try to compile 2.4.2 or 2.4.1 I get the error:

        arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o arch/i386/mm/mm.o kernel/kernel.o

I also tried it on another Machine, but I got the same result.

I am using a Toshiba Satellite 2800 Notebook.

The output of lspci is:

I am using Debian Sid:
gcc version: 2.95.3-5
binutils version: 2.10.91.0.2-2
ldso version: 1.9.11-14

The config-file is attached.

Please also reply to my mail-adress because I am not reading the
