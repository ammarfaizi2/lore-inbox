Plain simply wrong - Linux has more than 50% in the "Internet =

server market" (even if some company's propaganda department's do not =

admit this).
Attacker choose the weakest target (this is usually also the largest, =

It is "the details" that matter in this area.
M$ sells their software with the "everyone can install it, use, etc. =

because it is user-friendly[0], it does exactly what the user needs, =

it does everything automatically, etc." argument (which is plain simply
wrong[1]). =

Therefore lots of people install and run servers on the web without reall=
y
knowing what they are doing. Apparently they think that they install =

it and it runs on its own (which is wrong).
The learning curve on a U*ix system with some appropriate server =

software on it s much steeper. So if you get such a system on the web
you are forced to know more about it (and usually at one point =

you get to people who basically force you to think about security or =

other areas).

You could run a "secure" Win*server or workstations on the Net, but his m=

-) you disable all kinds of automatic code execution features (which
   means disabling all the nifty features, setting all hosts to =

   "internet zone", disable Active-X and JavaScript[2] completely, etc.).=

If you would do this, you could as well run the service on a U*ix =

system because the functional features are the same and you get =

patches much earlier (how long took the tear-drop patch for WinNT ?).

You should also list the disadvantages, not only one argument if you =

Read the usenet and you will see a significant difference.
Until then you are trolling.

[2] : This should actually be disabled on all browsers on the world.
      Actually this should be removed completely.
