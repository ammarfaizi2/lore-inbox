Just to add a few more cents, googling around I found that Paul Sladen 
has already been looking for some info on the chip. Started to RE the 
windows driver, this kind of info _might_ be useful :
Windows drivers read in 28-bytes via an IOCTL(0x733fc) on "\ShockMgr" . 
  (See shockprf.sys)

Eric (who is looking forward playing Neverball the Right Way (tm) ;-) )


PS: I don't know Paul Sladen's address and couldn't find it on his 
webpage. Hopping this email address will do it anyway.
