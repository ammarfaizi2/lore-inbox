Larry has on several occasions posted explaining why at the current time, he
has to make the difficult choice between keeping it closed source and actually
paying his programmers.

The open-source zealots are not going to make any friends by beating up on
people who aren't in a position to do anything.  You write Larry a big enough
check, it'll be open-source by Wednesday.  The only problem here is that nobody
is writing Larry a check...
