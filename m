Instead of saying "doesn't check", I would rather say "cannot check".
Without access to proprietary source code I'm going to have a hard time

A company doesn't check contributions line-by-line either. In fact they
often prefer to hire someone who has several years of experience in the
field, so they are intentionally trying to hire people that have had
