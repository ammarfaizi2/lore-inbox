FYI, an Athlon-optimized 2.4.6-ac5 still barfs during boot on my EPoX
8KTA3+.

As with earlier kernels/patches it does boot w/ i686 optimizations.

So far I haven't seen any of the run-time oopses that I get w/ the
earlier kernels/patches when compiled as i686, but it has only been
running for a couple of hours, so that isn't diagnostic yet.

Thanks,
