And there is the real danger of terrorism. Someone once wrote a book
(called "The Art of War") that describes it. It's the realm of "divide
and conquer". It brings a lot of people together to finally agree on
things when they wouldn't even talk to each other. But it also brings
together the "bad" things. These laws are dangerous because they add to
the terrorist concept of divide and conquer, only now we're sponsoring
it against ourselves, and companies like Disney and much of the
entertainment industry finds it profitable to join the momentum, it's
profitable for them.
