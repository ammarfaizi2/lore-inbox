I don't see the problem. If I ship you GPL code then you have no "right"
to updates from me. You are arguing about a right that never existed and
for good reason. Do you think that if Linus personally emails you a
snapshot you somehow acquire the right to demand newer updates from him
? or how about "I bought Red Hat 1.1 so you must send me 9.0". Both
strike me as a little ridiculous and certainly not GPL granted rights.

As a GPL code provider their duties to you are to the source to the GPL
code they gave you binaries for (or other variant options in the
license). They end there. I don't have to give your friend a copy, I
don't have to give you updates.
