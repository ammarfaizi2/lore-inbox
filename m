Oh believe me I understand exactly why Linus said "v2 only". The GPL say
"similiar license" but Linus doesn't trust Richard. That's fine, I don't
trust Richard or Linus 8)

If people are going to say "v2 only" they should most definitely make
sure they assign Linus or some similar person the right to revisit that
decision.
