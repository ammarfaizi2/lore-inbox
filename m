Is there a status page for that? I see that Tyan is going to (probably)
release a four-way board in the near future (post in comp.sys.intel
links to pictures, etc) and I deserve a new toy for my birthday in the
spring, so this is not idle curiousity. When I see the prices it may be,
but the SMP CPUs are affordable.
