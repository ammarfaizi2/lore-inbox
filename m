Yes, and that's the only way to make changes in the kernel, sorry.

I don't think it's workable, and goes against the current way the kernel
does things.  But please, feel free to prove me wrong with a patch
otherwise.  I don't want to debate it otherwise.

I think the current way we handle firmware works quite well, especially
given the wide range of different devices that it works for (everything
from BIOS upgrades to different wireless driver stages).
