Well, you have the patches, so you can't say that you can't use it. If
you don't like you can make a branch from the 2.5 kernel including xfs.

But personally i don't mind if xfs is not included, I assume that
there's some reason for not merging it, and i'd be glad to hear the
reasons for not merging it, insteand of blaming to Linus "The evil
non-merger" Torvalds
