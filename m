I very much mean "major contributors".

Quite frankly, the FSF isn't actually doing any of the work for any of the 
tools it maintains any more. And hasn't for a long while.

Hint: look up the glibc maintainers opinions on some of these same issues 
in the past. They had reason to clash with the FSF over a _much_ smaller 
license change (LGPL 2 -> 2.1).
