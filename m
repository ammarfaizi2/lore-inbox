I'm going to take a break from lurking to point out that I am not 
dissatisfied with Windows.  It has its uses, as do Linux (and NetBSD, and 
Solaris, and the other operating systems I have installed at home).  Frankly, 
I don't have a problem with Microsoft.  If I don't like their product, I'm 
free to choose not to use it.
