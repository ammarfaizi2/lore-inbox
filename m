Just to let people know there's a new version of Petr's ongoing work
with the matrox framebuffer available:

ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/

the file is called mga-2.5.65.gz, and it works wonderfully.

As far as I know, this patch was only announced on the fbdev-developers
mailing-list. I assume there are more matrox-users here.

Good luck,
Jurriaan
