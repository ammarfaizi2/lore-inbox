Actually My problem is to report the current problems in hotplugging of
FC-HBA on PCI Express for kernel 2.6.8 and don't have the hardware, I have
studied the code, searched and studied the documents available in the
internet, but I am not able to conclude. That is why I thought of taking
help from you experienced people.
I think now the problem is clear to you.
Please help me.

I don't wish to be annoying, but you have been asking this same question for
a while now.  You were told that this should work, and for you to report any
issues that you found.  So, I'm guessing that you have not yet actually
tried this out?  Why not?
