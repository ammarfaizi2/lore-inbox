Hello,
    Same deal as before, on my rh9 box i have mkinitrd version 3.4.42-1
    Is this sufficient for running a 2.5 kernel? I heard there was some
update to mkinitrd i might have to get, which might explain why the system
is hanging after the initrd image, but have not been able to find it.
Thanks.
Dave.
