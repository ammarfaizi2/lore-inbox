May I thank all of you who have taken time and been so kind as to help 
out with my question. I'll try to put concrete something together, and 
perhaps ask for any specific comment at that time.

Just one general comment, though. I believe it would be a very big coup 
for Linux if this feature (hot-swap IDE) were built into Linux properly. 
These big HDs are getting cheap, and the ability to back-up entire 
systems, send truly huge image and sound files to colleagues, etc., make 
this a really high-potential medium. A concrete *feature* like this 
would really speak to less knowledgeable users than some of the more 
technical developments, vital though they are.

Anyway, thank you all and thanks also for your dedicated and selfless 
work for the rest of us!
