Hi all,

	For those with CPU cycles to spare, you can now produce your
own graphs of the 2.4.0 Linux Kernel sources.  Marvel at the living
horror of drivers/telephony/ixj.c!  View arch/ia64 in all its gory!
Play `find the kernel bug' at parties with friends!

One of those project I began back when I had too much time...
Rusty.
