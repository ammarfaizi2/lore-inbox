Hi,
I am a graduate student in Electrical Engineering (Computer Networks). As a part of my project in a advanced computer networking course, I have chosen "Size Dependent Sampling in Linux Kernel" as my project.

Size Dependent Sampling algorithm defines new type of sampling mechanism to sample the TCP flows. Can you please let me know which are or directory should I start looking into to find where can I change the kernel code to accomplish this algorithm.

Thank you very much,
Jitendra.
