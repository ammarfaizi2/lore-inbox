I am using 2.4.21 ( + IMQ ) patch, on a vanilla 2.4.21 kernel, the
hardware is a dual Xeon 2.4GhZ ( IBM Xseries 235 ), with 1.5 GB of RAM,
it has one TG3 card for the Internet feed, and 3 Intel X-PCI E1000 cards
for the internal feeds.
The disk subsystem is a LSI Logic ( "Fusion" ) SCSI subsystem, and 2
drives are configured as an hw mirror.


The machine is used as a transparent proxy/NAT box/Router.

While the machine seems stable on a single processor kernel , if I
compile with SMP enable after 1-2 hours under load (70 users) it OOPSes
with this message :

- The "Tainted: PF" is apparently due to a dgdm.o module that handles
the Digi RAS card inside the server. )

- The hyperthreading feature was enabled, for a total of 4 CPUs.

Any idea ? The server is in production and I switched back to an
uniprocessor kernel ( same config except I disabled SMP),
and it appears stable in this configuration.  Since the machine is In
production I will have to organize a "crash test" but let me know if
more details are needed.

Regards,
Enrico
