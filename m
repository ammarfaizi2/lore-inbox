Excuse my ignorant jumping into this thread. Correct me if I'm wrong:  
Linus takes code provided by others under "GPLv2 or any later  
version" and decides to comply to the rules of v2, which allow him to  
distribute the work under v2 only. Incidentally v2 is also the less  
strict than v3, so all Linus does is take the greatest freedom he is  
offered (and pass it on, of course).

The problem would start only if someone insisted on GPLv3 for his/her  
code and wanted to get it merged in Linus' tree. I think the only one  
to clarify this point is Linus, and he has already done so.

Ciao,
                     Roland
