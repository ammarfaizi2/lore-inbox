I know I am. No new news here. =)

Well, the fact that you lashed out saying Linus shouldn't be maintainer 
for 2.5 is just completely ludicrous.

For one, it's the developmental tree. There's nothing to maintain. No 
one should be using it on productions boxes. No distribution should be 
including it with any of their released product.

Second, where do you draw the line between development and maintenance 
on a dev tree?
	def. maintenance: The work of keeping something in proper 
condition; upkeep.

	* Linus develops new driver model.
	* Linus updates basic drivers to work with new driver model so 
kernel can at least compile so he can see if driver model is good.
		*slap on Linus' wrist* You're not supposed to be doing maintenance.


I also don't see how you propose that these two tasks be split up for 
2.5. You don't provide any backing and you're surprised the whole group 
is disagreeing with you?
