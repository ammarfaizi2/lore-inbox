Ben,

   Well in that case you will have to talk to marketing and sales.  Try

You're missing the point.  We as developers want the specifications for 
the hardware as we're completely willing to write our own driver from 
scratch.  Until Itex is able to provide this to developers, products 
based on your chipsets will remain not recommended for Linux users as 
it will continually result in a poor user experience.
