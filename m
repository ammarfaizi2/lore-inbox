You have lots of "possible legal problems" of any kind. Basically
everyone can sue you for (almost) whatever he wants almost all ofth
time.

It is starting now. Basically the corporations with the masses of
software patents and patent lawyers are probably waiting for the
settling of the discussion and the ratification of the relevant
to-be-accepted laws. And the war is not over yet ...
In fact software patents are real in EUrope and they exist (though
illegally). Up to now it was a question of whether you can succeed in
court with them and which courts to go ....

the legislation is already USPTO-conform in place and nobody knows .....
