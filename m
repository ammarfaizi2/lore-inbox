It's me again, back on the minor device number enlargement patch.

Your patch looks good. It's simple enough to verify correctness. With 
all the work that has been done already on the minor device number 
enlargment in 2.6 it seems a shame that this final piece is not yet 
in the kernel tree.

Shouldn't this be submitted to Linux with a justification like the above?

What do you guys think about the chances of getting it accepted?
