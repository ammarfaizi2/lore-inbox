Well, there doesn't seem to be a great rush to include FUSE in the
kernel.  Maybe they just don't realize what they are missing out on ;)

So if any of you would like to support this motion, you can mail the
linux-kernel list and maybe Linus and Andrew, to generate a little
discussion on why (or why not) inclusion is a good idea.

Thanks,
