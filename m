I don't think so. This also bits Larry. If he does well enought, there'll be
some people here that won't use bitkeeper just because they can use the cvs
gateway and they don't need/miss the features they could get with bk.

And i don't think it avoids creating a free bk clone. I guess that there's
a lot of people out there interested in such tool, and not only for kernel
development; this won't stop them.

As far as i can see; Larry is just wasting time (money) to help the kernel
development and people who doesn't use BK just because it isn't free. And
he's not charging me, so i find this a good movement for everybody. I only
can say thanks.
