We want to use Linux for avionics software and need to certify it to
DO-178B. For that we must reference any development standards that have
been used. These are in particular
- software requirements standards
- software design standards
- software code standards

I found the file Documentation/CodingStyle to be relevant. Is there
anything else that has been written and followed? If someone can say
that there is not, which I think is quite likely, this information would
also be valuable.

Thank you very much in advance
