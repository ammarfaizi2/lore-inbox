Subject: offtopic: how to break huge patch into smaller independent patches?

Its kind of offtopic, but I hoped that someone might have some pointers since 
the kernel developers deal with so many patches.

I've been given a massive kernel patch that makes a whole bunch of conceptually 
independent changes.

Does anyone have any advice on how to break it up into independent patches?
