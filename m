Assuming that the first thing presented was a round one and not the 
flat-sided square that is being misrepresented.

We all know this, and it was their intent to slap around the idea that we
lack quality.

No, because marketing people have at least three faces.

Like I said, he is a lamb in a slaughter house that Promise created.
It was just this year (late-April) that Promise came "HAT and Hand" and
"Knife in the Other" and I got suckered again.

Because I am a lamer in email and prefere face to face.

I am sorry to chuckle but people have lost their jobs at Promise over
working with me to bring that company closer to GPL.  The guys that this
has happened to I offered to help them out but they managed on their own.

No, I will reconsider, since we are assuming that they are coming back
with two hats, one in each hand.  This one hat one hand thing hurts.

It is unfair, because I got screwed by Promise just this past April.
It was the last time and I told them that fact.

In this case you are wrong and I wish you were not.

Lastly, I gave this fellow my mobile cell-number and told him that I do
not want his driver, I want honesty and that I am mad and tired of the
story-line and "Broken Promise's" that they send and sell.

So Craig, my phone has not rung or your story has not changed.
