Whoops, sorry. Attached the wrong .config. PPP options that are set:
CONFIG_PPP=3Dy
CONFIG_PPP_ASYNC=3Dy
CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY=3Dy
CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE=3Dy
CONFIG_PPP_BSDCOMP=3Dy
CONFIG_PPPOE=3Dy

Probably only PPP and PPPOE is needed. The rest is just there for he now=20
obsolete ISDN card.

Sorry for attaching the wrong .config. I thought I picked the right one. :)
*double checking it this time*
