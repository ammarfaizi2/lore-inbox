i've been experiencing random lockups on my p5-200 box with 96M ram.
it seems to happen around 20+ days, but recently happened as quickly as=20
5 days.  usually x had the screen powered off, so i couldn't see=20
anything.  recently, i had it happen without x running, and i saw the=20
oops and kernel panic, but couldn't scroll to see the entire message,=20
and worse, nothing is logged, so i can't run it through ksymoops.

before one of the crashes though, i did see ``Warning - running low on
DMA memory'', which i found to be reported from
drivers/scsi/scsi_merge.c.

this has happend at leasts with 2.4.1[78].  while my current kernel is
compiled with gcc 3.0.4, earlier kernels were compiled with gcc
2.95.[34].

if there is anymore info, or anything i can do to more thoroughly
debug, let me know.

email me directly or on lkml, i'll get it either way.

thanks.
