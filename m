I thought so:

http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104534718212591&w=2

I just wanted to confirm that bk-commit-head is actually:

1. Complete
2. Realtime

If so, anybody can track Linus' tree, in real time, without using
BitKeeper.

Therefore, mailing lists for every single Linux-related BK repository
would allow anybody to track all of the trees in real time, without
using BK.

Unless bandwidth is a problem, (possible for dial-up users), I don't
see why we can't do that.  How many people subscribed to this list are
still on dial-up?

Larry needn't even pay for the outbound bandwidth for the mailing
list, except to forward it to somebody who is willing to send it out.

John.
