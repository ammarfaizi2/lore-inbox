I've started a new project, "virtual machines", with which it should be
possible to do some funky things. I don't know if this is the 'on the lines
of IBM/VM'-thing, but it seems to be very nice to have in the kernel, once
completed.

It's very preliminary, but everyone interested should come and take a look
at http://www.lr.tudelft.nl/~lr788024/vmach/

VrGr,
