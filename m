There is no relation between using kprobes and reducing the logged data
size. At the end the debugging/tracing facility is there to provide data
to the developer who tries to detect the problem or ensure correctness.

The kprobes can only serve as a replacement to changing the source code
in order to extract the debugging information, and it does it very well.

Cutting the amount of data transferred is only possible if you add the
problem detection logic into the kernel and only transport problem
reports to user-mode.
