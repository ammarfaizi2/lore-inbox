Hi,
I have got problem runing Synaptics touchpad on kernel 2.6.0test3mm2.
When previously booted system was windows XP, than the touchpad is working:
here is part of working dmesg:

Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:0c.0 (0000 -> 0002)

Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
 Firmware: 5.6
 180 degree mounted touchpad

NET4: Linux TCP/IP 1.0 for NET4.0

But when previous system was linux, the touchpad is not working:

Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 128x48
Yenta: CardBus bridge found at 0000:00:0c.0 [1558:4201]

NET4: Linux TCP/IP 1.0 for NET4.0

Its reproduceable. My hardware is Clevo D610S notebook,
part of my config is here

CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2_SYNAPTICS=y
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X=1400
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y=1050
CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV=y

I have not tested it with previous versions of kernel
Thanx for help.
