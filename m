Hi all,
I was upgrading kernel on my server this one day last week. I have
2.6.0-test4 running there happily. But I lost it's config somehow so I
started everything from the beginning.

I first tried to upgrade to -test8 and had some random lockups (The
lockups happened about two minutes after reboot). So I tested -test9
there today. And still got random lockups, after modification of config
my server did hang on for seven hours, and again lockup.=20

My test4 was running for 60 days without any problems, untill I decided
to upgrade. And I found no errors in log files from the crash time, so
this is probably a total mystery. I'll attach my config[1], lspci[2] and
lsmod[3] output so you'll see if there's something wrong.

Any suggestions would be welcome. I can't reboot the server many times,
but if you see something wrong straight ahead just tell me.

Thank you.
