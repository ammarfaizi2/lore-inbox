True, but it also seemed to create a certain energy that now seems to be
slipping away.  Maybe this is just called 'maturity', I don't know.  Now,
my original objection was *only* to the inclusion of the Bitkeeper
documentation in the kernel tree.  A well-known developer who has chosen
to stay out of the discussion - perhaps by reason of being asleep - used
the term 'bitkeeper mafia'.  That's not a good sign.  At this juncture, a
little moderation, as you've shown, could do a lot to mitigate that
perception.

Then it would be back to the usual programming: how to make it all better.

The missing part is watching the mail go by.  It's the discourse, where
has it gone?  What happened to the times when patches were actually
discussed before going into the tree?  Can we somehow have that and
bitkeeper too... and a fairy castle...
