dmesg outputs the following 

orinoco_cs.c 0.13e (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au> and others)
orinoco_cs: RequestIRQ: Unsupported mode

It does that in 2.6.0-test2-(bk7|bk7-netdrvr1|mm5).

It functions correctly in 2.6.0-test2 and -mm4.

Attached is my config for 2.6.0-test2-mm5 as well as mm4-mm5_config.diff
which is a diff -u on the two .config's used.

Also, I just noticed that dmesg produces:
orinoco.c 0.13e (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au> and others)
orinoco_cs: Unknown parameter `8200'

But it is in the dmesg output of both mm4 and mm5

Let me know if anything else is needed to try to figure out what happend
between -mm4 and -mm5

Will
