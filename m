You are not serious? Aren't you? 'Bit of paranoia there?

Can't you just imagine somebody who did get out of the coding business in
professional terms but stills to enjoys hacking from time to time?
If you are impressed by my speed, and can't imagine that what I'm doing 
is the
outcome of just a few spare houers at home, then well I certainly can't 
help you....

PS. If I would have a hidden agenda I wouldn't post from the evision 
domain becouse
I know a bit about mailing systems as well ;-). And I would care to be 
polite and a slick
ass to everybody, which I CERTAINLY don't you s******
