I totally understand this.  To a point.

True, but that has always been the case.

This really isn't a crypto question though, and this has financial
ramifications here as well.  Violating a French law isn't as scary to me
as having to hire a patent lawyer here in the US...

Hey I'm all for allowing the use of patented algorithms in the kernel,
but I think they should be separate trees or patches that can be applied
and hosted elsewhere, the same way crypto was afor a long time.  I think
the idea should be to step on as few toes as possible, not knowingly do
it because it can be done...that's all.  You have to remember, patents
here are frightening, and you damned well better have a lot of money if
you are going to need a patent lawyer, that is a commodity most of us
can't afford.
