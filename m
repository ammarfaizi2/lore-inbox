But the timeline is simply wrong.  DMCA is an implementation of the WIPO
TRIPS treaties, which was passed in 1996, well before open-source was a
common topic.

See http://www.public-domain.org/wipo/dec96/dec96.html
In particular, note the EFF comment and the comment by "Software
Developers".  Even these most relevant sources simply did not raise the
issue.

DRM is another issue.  I think it is primarily an effect of the Hollywood
reality distortion field.  They think that useful computers that are not
Turing complete can be built; and if such machines cannot be built, well, 
Hollywood thinks that digital communication is error free and occurs 
without charge and with infinite bandwidth at infinite distance, putting 
them permanently out of business.
