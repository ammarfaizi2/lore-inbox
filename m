Which means that you are the only one who cares.

So it seems that many more people care about _not_ using "GNU/" with
"Linux".  Yes those people are 1) many and 2) speak on their own and 3)  
never concerted to form that same opinion.  There must be something there...

Just as every other free software developers.  Yet the _majority_ of those
GNU developers seem to be quite happy with the way they get credits,
otherwise they would complain on their own.  You just can't decide for the
whole community how it should be done.

your credibility on this whole matter.
