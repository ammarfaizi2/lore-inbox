Don't forget the linux-kernel favorite, "Debuggers are for bad
programmers".

} Here are more from the same basket you obviously got the first quote from:
} 
} ------------------------------------
} Virtual memory is only for unskilled programmers who don't know how to use
} overlays.
} ------------------------------------
} Protected memory is a constant 10% CPU hog needed only by undisciplined
} programmers who can't keep their memory writes in their own process space.
} ------------------------------------
