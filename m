Last time I checked, it didn't matter if a person had "cashed out their 
millions" for a program to go opensource.  So fucking what.  I'm a poor 
college student, as many are, and yet, I still see a lot of useful 
programs coming out.  The Gimp, for one, was written by students at 
Berkeley.  Last time I checked, no one was making money off of 
enlightenment, and they are all still poor.  Stop fucking whining about 
it and stop compromising your ideals for money.  Also, before you can 
say it, yes you've stated your ideals by saying that it WOULD have been 
opensource if you had money.  Well that means you believe in opensource 
somewhat at least.  Get over the money issue though.  There are a lot of 
people who could benefit from bitkeeper being opensourced, so why not go 
and do it?

Serve others, not yourself.
