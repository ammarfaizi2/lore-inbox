I just received the documention for the IDE conrollers
in may older Toshiba notebooks.  These controllers are
capable of DMA, but at the moment do not have it
implemented.  I know nothing about programming IDE
drivers, so if anyone is interested in developing
these drivers shoot me an email and I can send you the
docs and help with testing (I have several notebooks
to test on).  I'd like to get into it myself, but just
don't have the time.

Alex
