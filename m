That's really hard to believe, but on the other hand, when packaging my programs,
SUSE people were always cooperating very well.

So, let's ask the SUSE'rs around there: is there any problem with adding such
a notice to the cdrecord package?

But this problem (which I believe will be solved soon) aside, what is exactly
crippled on the version SUSE ships?

				Have a nice fortnight
