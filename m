You're again spreading FUD and playing this political game hoping
your management is reading this and merely because of this they'll award you.
I cannot blame you -- how many of them read C code or specs...  I mean, even
"the community" has said "no" to specs.  All you're doing is just playing
your political game, spreading FUD.

And what "process" are you talking about?  Do you have any idea the
_amazement_ people get when learing that Linux is going to implement
showing all phys on the domain in sysfs...?  Do you have any idea
the effort in keeping customers happy when the whims of "the community"
change on an a hourly basis (as the community is learning)?  Shall I give
examples?

over the world.

When you said in your email:
