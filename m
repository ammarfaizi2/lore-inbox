My work on making lvm useable in 2.5 is available by doing:
bk pull bk://0x63.nu/lvm-2.5

But snapshots doesn't work, extending/reducing doesn't work. Actually
the only things I know that the work is mounting lv's and
vgdisplaying. Running /home and /var on lvm on the machine I'm writing
this mail.
(wish i had uml for 2.5)
