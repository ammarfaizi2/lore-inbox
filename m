Mostly because there is an entirely seperate mailing list for MIPS issues.
You'll find a quite active list that is so prestegious<g> there are guys
that work the MIPS Technologies (The MIPS people :-) ) on it.  You might even
want to check in on it.  The MIPS arch is actually quite nice.  It has
generally good FP performance, a large pool of general use registers, and many
other really convenient attributes.  You can join the list by sending a
mail to majordomo@oss.sgi.com with 

subscribe linux-mips your@email.address

in the body.
