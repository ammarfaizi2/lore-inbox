And somebody who did B.Mus. :-)  But I also did computer science 
courses at the same time, and after that graduate CS courses.  I really 
think there is no substitute for university level education here.  Yes, 
there are great hackers who got that way without formal education in 
the field, but I'll bet that most of them wish they had not missed the 
opportunity.

I firmly believe that Comp Sci by itself is not balanced enough, you 
need to have deep knowledge of *some* unrelated field to obtain the 
required perspective needed not only to solve problems, but to know why 
you want to solve them.

Music in particular teaches you about form and balance, and also a deep 
respect for the need to practice and perfect the low-level skills 
prerequisite to the flashier achievements we all aspire to.  Not to 
mention helping speed up your typing.
