hi folks:
	I read the "linux device drivers" book by Rubini. but it's kind of
	boring to only experiment with the memory device, I tried to
	find an actualy hardware (inexpensive and relatively simple) to try
	out, but no document exists explaining the hardware protocol.
	I wonder how people managed to write the numerous drivers in the
	kernel source. how did they get the hardware documentation? 

	could someone give me a pointer to an easy device with enough
	documentation? thanks a lot!

	Yang
