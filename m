I thought that originally was Andrew Tridgels output?

I'm having problems with it too, but only on a deb3.1 system.  I 
looked in Borders yesterday, but couldn't find a 'samba for dummies' 
or similar publication.

The question then is: Where might there be a decent publication 
describing samba and how to make it work?  Dead tree, pdf equally 
welcome here.
