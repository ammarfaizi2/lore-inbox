If this is truely the case, I'd suggest that kernel.org be modified, as 
it refers to them as *stable*
as of 9:18PM PDT, direct copy & paste from kernel.org page:

The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is: 2.4.8 2001-08-11 04:13 
UTC Changelog 

The latest prepatch (alpha) version appears to be: 2.4.9-pre3 2001-08-13 
23:56 UTC Changelog
