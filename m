Hi,

I'm seeing a problem that's causing me someone may be able to shed some light
on.

I've been running late 2.5.x kernels on a dual PPro box here for testing
things. After a while (which can be anything from a few minutes to a couple of
days), the timer interrupts stop happening. Most other interrupt sources (such
as the network card, but not, apparently, the keyboard) continue to happen
though. I've tried changing the motherboard and CPU set, but to no avail.

Anyone any suggestions as to what it might be, or what I might try to better
determine the root of the problem?

I've attached the config I've been using for the kernels.

Cheers,
David
