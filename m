Hi linux techies,
    I use linux to connect to my workplace using ppp. I initially had
problems transferring data. What I observed over time was:
1] Transferring files (using FTP) was slow when I used linux 2.4.7.10
(redhat 7.2)
2] When I changed to kernel 2.4.18 (redhat 7.3) I observed a lot of
improvement in speed.
I was curious to know what changes were done in the kernel to improve
the speed. Or was it a problem any other problem.

Since I am not on the list, please add my name in the reply.

Thanks,
Srivathsa
