This is commercial module and will not be merged into mainline.

It would be helpful if I could get at least confirmation if the thing is
doable what I described earlier. 

Pardon me as I don't mean to sound rude; I'm not interested if this
should be done in some totally different way. Let's just say that my
curiosity is peaked to the point that I want & need to know how to
search modules by name in kernel space. I don't know how to be more
specific what comes to my problem.

Thanks in advance for any input!

Br,
antti
