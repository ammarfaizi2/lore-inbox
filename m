And for feeding the DB, could this be an extended KLive approach which gathers
device ID, querys the database for ho many versions there really are 
under this id :-) and asks some questions:

* are you happy with performance of 1234:5678 Graphics Adapter xyz?
* is said adapter of type OEM, Original, ...
* is feature f working?
* how about feature l?
* kernel version
* an so on

How about getting hardware review people on board?
They do good testing and recieve a link back to their site?

Dirk
