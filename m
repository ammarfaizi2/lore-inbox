I'm not so sure about that. It is going to be heavily NDA'ed
and look-but-not-touch.

Enterprise customers are beginning to see the value of having
source available, and MS is doing this as a half-baked
solution to give decition makers one less reason for switching
to Open Source.

This also gives MS an opportunity to do PR. Expect some "We
provide our customers with the good benefits of Open Source
without the danger of fragmentation and market confusion" from
their marketroids soon.

Compare this to the release of W98SE. The main reason for SE was
to stop home users being introduced to Linux because of ipmasq'ing.

You can accuse MS of a lot of things. Being stupid and ignorant
of the market is not one of them.
