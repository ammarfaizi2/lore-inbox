Well, I attach my config for your enjoyment -

At first glance, the only thing that strikes
me about your config is that you don't
like modules, and it also seems to be a
laptop config -

BTW not compiling tux as a module
must suck - instead of stopping tux
and unloading the module, you must
reboot as with a windoze pee cee, if
major config changes are made -

BTW I'm using Red Hat 7.1 & 7.2, gcc-2.96 -

(Please oblige the following sanity check)

After applying patches, be sure there are
no rejects - and then after saving your config,
do a "make mrproper", then after restoring
your .config, do a "make oldconfig", then do
the normal compile steps -
