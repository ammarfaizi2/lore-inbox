Excuse me, but shouldn't it be a goal to have the kernel compiling 
cleanly on gcc-3.0 as soon as is reasonable?
Telling people to use older versions of GCC for the kernel is not really 
a "good" thing if it can be avoided.
Personaly I don't use gcc-3.0 yet, but some do, and many will follow, and 
when they do, it'd be nice to have the kernel compiling cleanly, would it 
not?
They want a fix, not a one-line editorial. They're reporting a "bug", so 
that it may be fixed.
