Hi mailing list.

This kernel is used from business critical servers over desktops to 
embedded devices.
It got rather important - as it's versioning did. Changing it leads into 
confusion, as we saw, so one shouldn't play with those numbers.

I think it does (almost) not matter which versioning gets chosen - but 
once chosen, one should stick to it.


Sincerely yours,

		Daniel Herzog
