sorry for my stupid question:

after trying to use git since a few days, i pulled down my own
git repository and successfully checked out libata-dev. After
I updated my repository today, I get out a 2.6.15-rc1 release now.
However I want to stay with 2.6.14 by now and apply the libata
tree to this. I even see the desired tag in my repository, but
in spite of all document reading I can't find out how to checkout
this tag and how to apply the current libata tree then.

Can someone give me a hint or a link please?
