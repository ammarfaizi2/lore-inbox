The problem is not necessarily the init scripts. Each
distributor can customise these quite easily. The problem
is (how I see it) divided into two parts:

	I. The kernel messages. (And yes, I do know
      about both, "quiet" and "console=/foo/bar)

	II. Both, using "quiet" or "console=/foo/bar",
      and customising the init scripts only leaves
      you with a blank, black screen. Now, you might
      argue how "classic" or "beatieful" black is.
      But it should be obvious this is an absolute
      matter of taste. A nice picture is far more
      appealing, and pleasing, and whatnot.
