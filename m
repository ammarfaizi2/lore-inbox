Hi,

I have watched this thread, and I am unable to understand what problems 
people have with a autoconfigurator!

Eric, go ahead and produce an autoconfigurator. If it works, it will become a 
useful tool for those who need it. It will not interfere with the current 
practice of manual kernel configuration and will not cause any inconvenience 
to developers. And it will be useful!

Think of it in the context of a magic "Build-me-an-optimised-kernel" button 
which would appear on the desktop of distro X. Which could be useful. 

The point is, people who have no need for an autoconfig tool need not use it.

Melvin configures manually.
Aunt Tillie uses her distro kernels.
The small group of people who have the knowledge/requirement to build their 
own kernels, but without sufficent technical knowhow to configure it, and 
understand some myriad options, will find the autoconfig tool useful. And 
Linux is about covering all the groups, is it not?

Just my 0.02 euro.
