Hi Jim,

	Check out http://bugme.osdl.org. It is a 2.5 kernel tracker
database and if you search for all New but not Assigned bugs then
you will see bugs that need to be worked on. Find one that you think
you can do and send a patch out to this list for review. 
	Also a good starting point is http://www.kernelnewbies.org.

Happy Hacking!

Hanna
