Nonsense.

I believe these statements to be wrong.
I believe you might even know these statements are wrong.

It's sad really.

Subscribe to BK-KERNEL-COMMITS if you want to see every change
ever made and track them.  Use the web tools, use the CVS.

Perhaps now you'll say something like because BK doesn't provide
a cross-reference tool for every email to LK that proposes some patch
that BK is stopping you from importing "your" data.

Write your own import tools.

Stop whining.  Go write your own SCM.
BitBucket anyone?  Lots of activity on SF.
