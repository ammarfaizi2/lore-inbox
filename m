What are the reasons that Linux isn't kept in an CVS repository? I
mean, it would still give Linus full control over his branch of the
kernel, and it would make merging of Alan's branches into the main
branch easier.

Additionally, a BTS for the kernel would be nice. But this would be
difficult because many modules are developed as separate projects,
right?
