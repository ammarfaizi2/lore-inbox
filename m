Dear Mr. Hedrick,

I will comply with the directives of the Linux Community 
Representatives and direct Mr. McCullough to prepare the 
requested documentation.  

As you are aware, NWFS is a total rewrite of Novell's Native File 
System.  TRG has versioning systems that have tracked the creation
of this code since it was begun, and no Novell Source code was 
used, nor was any confidential information or trade secrets of
Novell as defined by UTSA (Uniform Trade Secrets Act).

These materials will be completed and submitted to you NLT 
Wednesday this week.  They will not be posted to LKML, since 
they are attorney work product.  We are greatly honored to be 
afforded the opportunity to submit our technology to the Linux 
Community, and for being given this chance to contribute to Linus 
Torvalds extraordinary efforts and the efforts of the other members 
of the Linux Community who have made a great success.

I will submit this documentation by Wednesday.  Andrew will be 
available at your discretion for a telephonic conversation to
address any specific concerns.  His direct line is 801-222-9635.

Wa-do

Jeff
