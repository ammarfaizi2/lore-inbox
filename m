Thanks for that info. before upgrading to RH7.1 I was using the nvidia 
drivers and had no problems at all. It's now using the nv driver shipped
with xfree 4.03 so that might be the problem, although with xfree 3.3.6
there wasn't a problem with either the nvidia or xfree drivers. I'll grab 
nvidia driver and give it a try.
