	Hi Linus,

	I've got a question... I would like where to send my driver
patches...

	One month ago, I sent a small update for the orinoco_cs driver
and Wireless Extensions. I didn't put all the changes I had for
orinoco_cs because I believe in small incremental updates limited to a
specific area (even if all the changes are trivial). You ignored my
patch (without feedback), whereas Alan picked it up (if I remember
correctly it was included in his 'patch-2.4.2-ac28').
	So now, what should I do with the rest of my updates and the
new one that have accumulated since ? Should I wait until you grab the
first patch from Alan's tree ? Should I send the new patches directly
to Alan so that he can accumulate a monster patch ? Should I just
accumulate the patches on my web page ?

	Another day, I will also tell you about the IrDA patches...

	Have fun...

	Jean
