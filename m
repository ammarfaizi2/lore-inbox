   Well it's not a yahoo users problem because yahoo users can't fix
   it. Some yahoo users have yahoo "free" mail as their only connection
   to the internet because of facist network administrators.

If you want all the SPAM that will result on Linux-kernel, we
can disable the filter if you want.

I refuse to sit here and listen to all the "this is the only
connection person FOO has to the internet" stories, quite frankly I'm
absolutely sick of hearing them.

If you don't have properly functioning mail, you can't use these
lists.

Period.
