A large bulk of the investment in Linux is starting to come in from
hardware manufacturers, notably IBM. These companies see Linux as a
means to sell more hardware, not as a means to sell software. This is
critical, because it means that it IS worth the money to make the driver
perform correctly, GPL or not, because a bad driver means no sales.

You can't argue from the standpoint of "small market" and then the
destruction of the market itself. By definition, in order for the
software market to be significantly damaged, Linux (and other open
source projects) would have to hold more than a small percentage of the
market. Hence, your market just got big and if you make hardware, you
better make a good driver.
