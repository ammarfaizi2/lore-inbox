welll... really it does understand that. Which is why propriatary systems
try to own the entire heirarchy... The cost history of propriatary software
shown above is the SUM of the entire evolution cost.. and the company wants
to say "... mine, mine, you can't have it (unless you give me more money for
every time you do use it...)". Which would explain the high cost of creating
"new" propriatary software.
