Ok. I admit I haven't read through the entire thread. It's a wee bit big
and painful so excuse me if this has already been suggested but... If
this is the biggest (or one of the biggest) sticking points then why not
get BK to email the lk mailing list when there's a patch submitted with
a desc of the patch and the patch itself (if the patch is over size x
then a link could be emailed out instead of the patch so as not to
overly spam ppls mailboxes) and maybe a short email indicating wether
or not Linus has accepted the patch and it's going in. If that's a bit
too much email then maybe a summary could be compiled every hour or so
and emailed out?

To me this looks like it'd allow those who want to use BK to continue
using BK and those who don't don't get to miss out on any patches being
put in and they'll also have the traditional medium of flamage^wfeedback
that everyone knows and loves easily available to them. This would then
generate discussion as ppl have the patch shoved under their noses as
it appears to have been the case before and generally would not disturb
those who want to use BK as they do now (except via the possible
consequences that the extra visibility of the patches would provide).

Anyhow, my apologies if I've babbled (it's 3:15am) and if this has been
suggested somewhere amongst the 100-150 or so msgs in this thread (I
only read the first 20-30 at the beginning and a select few in the
middle).
