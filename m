So, you have a problem with those binary drivers. Here's something:

1. Don't compare the fact that people here cannot support closed source 
drivers with what happened during the World War. Just don't. It's 
farfetched and totally wrong.

2. Have you even _looked_ for a solution? I have installed the latest 
kernel yesterday, and everything works fine. I compiled the nvidia modules 
on top of that kernel (2.4.15-pre2), and it works fine. Look and search 
before you start making false accusations!
