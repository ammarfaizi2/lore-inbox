Bah! I wish open-source advocates would leave this alone or at least
qualify things a bit better.


Yes, code scrutiny is often a good thing, but it doesn't make your
code bug free necessarily.  Sendmail and bind are good examples here
of code that is (was) widely deployed, had many eyes on it --- and yet
sucked in terrible ways :)

Plenty of other 'available source' packages have had nasties, such as
wu-ftpd, mutt, pine, lynx and nntpcache.

Every now and then (like once or twice a year), someone finds a nasty
in Linux too....
