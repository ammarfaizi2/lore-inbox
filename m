There were a couple of replies, but if you are going to argue this, please
read the analysis i made, and reply to it. Read in particular :

  http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00288.html

Which contains a more formal analysis from Humberto Massa.

So, given that this thread together with the GPLed firmware flasher thread got
a respectable amount of replies, i believe we can claim consensus, and this is
something the debian-kernel team has been acting upon, and i believe even
aknowledged by the release managers and ftp-masters.

If you have strong evidence that this is not the case, it would really have
been nice to comment on it before the kernel team (not only me which you may
dislike for past dealings or whatever) waste effort on something which is
wrong in the first place, and i commend you to participate in the above thread
asap, voicing your concerns (or remain silent forever thereafter :).

Friendly,

Sven Luther
