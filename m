I am trying to install a 2.6 kernel on a system with an ATI Southbridge 
SB400 chip that has the ide and SATA functions on it. When the system
boots up it detects the ide devices, but there is no indication any attempt
to find the SATA drive. The ATI web site indicates that there is a Linux
driver for this, but it is only provided to the developers.
Can anyone shed any light on the status of this?

Thanks in advance
Warren Steffen
