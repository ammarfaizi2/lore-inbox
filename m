Hi everyone,

I've put up an updated set of patches for AVR32 support at
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxPatches

The most interesting patch probably is
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/pub/Main/LinuxPatches/avr32-arch-2.patch

which, at 544K, is too large to attach here. Please let me know if you
want me to do it anyway.

Anyone want to have a look at this? I understand that a full review is
a huge job, but I'd appreciate a pointer or two in the general
direction that I need to take this in order to get it acceptable for
mainline.

HÃ¥vard
