Might not have been his email client.  Another easy way to botch the
tabs is to cut+paste the patch into the email's message composition
window, for those using gui-style mailers, such as Kmail (Patrick) or
Sylpheed (myself).  One can still inline patches with such tools - one
just has to be careful to read them into (File:Insert, perhaps) the
outgoing message from a file, rather than via cut+paste.
