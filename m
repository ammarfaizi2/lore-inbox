Contrary to popular opinion, not everybody lives in the US.
Here in Germany, receiving some particular frequencies (e.g. those used
by the police) was prohibited a few years ago (I don't know exactly if
they changed the law). The argument was that some receiver types emitted
a weak signal on the frequency they were listening to (and could be
tuned to become a private radio station) which could interfere with the
low-power police devices. However, it was simply not sensible to
prohibit all radios, so they were constained to a specific frequency range.
