Blah, Celsius is obviously more natural:

-50	Ok, this is what I'd call _REALLY_ cold
-40	With proper gear it's survivable but not much fun
-30	Time to put on a fur hat
-20	Long underwear is a good idea
-15	Nice winter day
-10	Slightly warm winter day
-5	Nice warm winter day
0	Slippery as hell outside, beware!
5	Cool summer day
10	Slightly cool summer day
15	Nice summer day
20	Very nice summer day
30	Better apply some sunscreen/take some water with you when going outside
40	With sunblock & lots of water it's survivable but not much fun
50	WAY too hot!!!
