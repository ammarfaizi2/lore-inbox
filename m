This is a completely different error from "VFS: Cannot open root device" or 
"unable to mount root".

Are you sure you have a "/sbin" directory with an *executable* "init" file on 
the usb harddrive?

Does your init file depend on libraries that you do not have under "/lib"? (you 
can check with "ldd init")

If your init is a script, does it specify a complete path to the interpreter, 
and do you have an *executable* interpreter there? Does the interpreter require 
libraries or is it static?

I hope this helps,
