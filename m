With the spelling cleaned up slightly, I just might want to quote that last 
sentence in my book.  Would you object?

I take it that superbrain, sirius/victor, and apricot were PC clones like the 
Tandy and Wang that were sort of but not really compatable?

"A quarter century of unix" mentions RK05 cartridges several times, but never 
says much ABOUT them.

Okay, so they're 2.4 megabyte removable cartridges?  How big?  Are they tapes 
or disk packs?  (I.E. can you run off of them or are they just storage?)  I 
know lots of early copies of unix were sent out from Bell Labs on RK05 
cartidges signed "love, ken"...

What was that big reel to reel tape they always show in movies, anyway?

I need a weekend just to collate stuff...

Considering that the Mark I was designed to compute tables of artillery 
firing angles during World War II...  It's a distinct trend, innit?  And the 
source of the game "artillery duel", of course...
