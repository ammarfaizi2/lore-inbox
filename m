Exactly.

There might also be some unexpected benefit for us in Europe lurking there 
since it sheds a very unfavourable light on US IP and SW patent law which the 
EU is currently being trying to adopt. So all of you living in the EU, please  
point your MEP (and your state and national MP for that matter) towards this 
mess and explain to him/her why software patents and all the other crap the 
EU commission wants to inflict on us is not in the interest of EU consumers 
and companies alike and let's see what happens...
