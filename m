Dear Sir,=20

It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and as=
sistance
in my desire to invest into Estate properties in your country,I saw you=
r
contact when I was doing research.=20

Briefly, I am an old man and due for retirement at any moment from now =
after
putting many years in civil service as Secretary Ministerial Contract E=
valuation
and Implementation, in the office of presidency. And during this past y=
ears
in the office I was able to secure huge amount of money from over-invoi=
ced
Government Contract Bills, through the advantage of my position in the =
office.

I have been deliberating on how to invest this fund abroad in a confide=
ntial
manner until I came to a conclusion to use it to buy estate Properties =
and
lease to people while part of it will be used for other lucrative inves=
tments
in your country as part of measures to secure the betterment of my reti=
rement
future, till I come over to meet with you.=20

In view of this, I am soliciting your confidence, support and assistanc=
e
as my partner to claim this fund for the investment project with your n=
ame
and support from the Security Vault where I deposited it for safe keepi=
ng.
This is because we civil servants are not allowed to own and operate do=
llar
accounts or having offshore account especially outside the country.=20

As a matter of fact, to claim this fund remains the vital issue for now=
 which
after the successful claim of the fund we can then invest immediately i=
nto
any Estate Property or any other areas you may consider lucrative in yo=
ur
country or else where.=20

However, I will be happy to disclose to you the amount to be claimed an=
d
invested as soon as I received your reply, as I expect you to be trustw=
orthy
and kind enough to respond positively to my inquiry.=20

Thanking you for your anticipated co-operation.=20

Regards,=20
Ta Manuel.=20
