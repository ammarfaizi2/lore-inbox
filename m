    Great.  So not only is there no legal need to cite GNU in the Linux 
    name, there is no ethical obligation either.

When you take part of my statement, stretch it, interpret it based on
assumptions you know I disagree with, and present the result as
something I said, that doesn't prove anything.  It is childish.

There is no ethical obligation to mention secondary contributions
incorporated in a large project.  There ethical obligation is to cite
the main developer.  In the GNU/Linux system, the GNU Project is the
principal contributor; the system is more GNU than anything else,
and we started it.
