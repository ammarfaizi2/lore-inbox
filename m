Hello John!
How are you?

How has passed your travel to Minsk?
Whether you have got acquainted with the beautiful and interesting girl? 

You of admiration of Russian women have intrigued me and I eventually too have become interested in it.
By your advice I have visited http://albabelarus.com and I liked two girls: ELENA # 4150 and TATYANA # 1964.
How you think, whether I can be a success even of one of them? 

I wait for your comments and the story on your trip. 

All the best. 
        Jose.        mailto:Jose@hotmail.com
