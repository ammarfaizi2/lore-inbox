This is partly by way of a test and partly by way of a question - I've
tried posting a patch here 4 times in the last 48 hours, none of them
have made it to the list but replies to the message (it was copied to
the alsa-devel and linux-sh lists also) have appeared here.

What is it that is causing my message to be trapped and forwarded
to /dev/null? It's not flagged as spam anywhere else - and nor should it
be - it's a patch!
