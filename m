There it is again, this /dev/null argument.

"Multi-billion dollar companies" have gone bancrupt on the simple fact that
diversification of one product can rattle customers/users to a degree that they
in fact decide against the whole product range.

IOW go on with the idea to spread around an unknown number of kernel versions
and you can be sure that linux as a whole will greatly suffer.

This is a "user" issue, not a "developer" issue of course. Developers can apply
any kind of patches they like, but don't go and tell the vast user base to
"just apply patch xyz". They won't honor this at all, your level of acceptance
will dramatically drop.

Stephan
