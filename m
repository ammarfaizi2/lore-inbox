Subject: How many versions of VM are there?

Can I get some clarification on how many different versions of VM are
"kicking around?" I know there is the 2.2 version, the 2.4.x Linus Torvalds
version, and Rik van Riel's version which currently resides in the
2.4.x-acyy tree. Are there others? Which one is likely to be the "fittest
that survives?" And where might I find documentation on the tuning parameters?
The 2.2 version is of little interest, but the others are quite important.
