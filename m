That's the problem.... :-)

I understand why people do this -- it's nice to see your name pop up and get
a bit credit -- but really, there are simply too many people working on linux
for it to really make sense.

I wish someone with a bit of pull would go through and just trash the whole
lot, leaving just the printks that give actual useful information (and even
those could often do with quite a bit of pruning)...
