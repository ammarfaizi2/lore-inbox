Just some general questions:

1) Is there anywhere a list that describes what is intended to be in 2.5.x ?
2) Are there any early releases of 2.5.x ?
3) Are the things for 2.5.x being discussed on another mailing list ?
4) What is the time frame of releasing 2.5.x-final (or 2.6.x) ?

Specifically, I'm more interested in the network driver aspect.
1) Are there any intended changes to the networking layer ?
2) I over heard something about making the driver reentrant - any news ?
3) What about support for IPv6 ? (I noticed it was marked as experimental
until now)

Hello people,

	I got some questions. When are we going to develop stuff for 2.5?
What is
planed? My opinion for linux 2.5 should be performance. Since linux already
is stable or well done for nature, we could thing more on performance to be
a diferencial over others. What do you people thing?

PS: Not a good english. I know! :)
