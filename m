Cool - thanks.

For the needs I had at the time, using Quilt (descendent from Andrew's
own patch tools) on his broken out patches seemed to work well.  I was
trying to drive home a somewhat intrusive patch set, and so wanting to
jump on top of select *-mm releases within hours of release, before the
chaos of additional conflicting changes caused Andrew to throw up his
hands, throwing me out again ;).  Well, Quilt for *-mm, on top of BK for
the 2.6.X-rcY base.  (Note the use of the "optimistic past tense" above,
a rare Latin verb form ...;).

It's good to know that *-mm is available by BK as well.  Thank-you.
