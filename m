  I simply question the idea that someone would need or want to download 
the source, and compile it for the purposes of piracy.  The current 
state of things seems to indicate the absence of source doesn't prevent 
piracy.  I suspect that I can find a usable pirated copy of virtually 
any popular software on the net.  This because copy protection doesn't 
work against any intelligent and determined person.  It works against 
the really lazy, and stupid who wouldn't be able, or want to compile a 
program any way.

Yes but why bother.  You don't need the source code to pirate software.
