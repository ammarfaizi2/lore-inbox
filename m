	That's actually a very good thing, it force impatient people
to get their experimental stuff into 2.5.X and try it there
first. That should make 2.5.X up-to-date and hopefully patches going
into 2.4.X more solid (who say compile error ?).
	Actually, if I were you, I would drop anything that has not
baked for a few days in 2.5.X, but that's not my call.

	Have fun...
