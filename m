Slow progress in gcc?

You know, I currently have a daily CVS of gcc at work, with an automatic  
diff mailed to me, and the amount of daily changes is simply incredible.  
Practically no day passes without at least one big pach, and about half a  
dozen patches from different people at least, going into the CVS.

I don't know how much faster you can get and still hope to deliver a  
stable product at the end.

MfG Kai
