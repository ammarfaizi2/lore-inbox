But it is not about the Linux kernel. It is purely about interpretation of
the GPL, which would be far better addressed in other forums dealing with
either FSF, GPL, or legal issues.

This whole thing is basically one person trying to discredit a company for
not doing things the GPL doesn't require. If they distributed source they
satisfied their responsibilities, and they have none to non-customers.
