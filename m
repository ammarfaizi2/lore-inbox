Actually, yes it does cost them. If you refuse to buy $2000 notebook,
because its 3D graphics card ($100) is not supported properly... well
notebook vendor is going to put pressure on graphics card vendor.

And you don't have to be Linux user to refuse closed hardware. Having
option in future is always good.x
