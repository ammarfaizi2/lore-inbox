Which is a lossy export.  Of course reverse engineering of Word is allowed,
you didn't get all your data.  You can get *all* of your data out of BK,
by definition.  BK can start with the data it exports and rebuild the 
revision history.  So can you.  So you are needlessly arguing.

Really?  Show me that law please.
