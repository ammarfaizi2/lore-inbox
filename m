I remember there being a web page where all of Microsoft's "innovations"
were listed and where they bought or stole it from.  The only things
that were really Microsoft's invention were, at that time, found to be
a) the .ini config file format (which has spread outside of the MS
world) and b) the annoying paper clip.

Does anyone have the URL handy?  Try finding that in a search engine...
