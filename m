OH!  My sincere apologies.  I have the tendency to hit "Reply" instead 
of "Reply All", and so often when replying to a list posting, I have to 
manually enter the lkml address.  When I didn't see lkml in the 
recipient list, I just assumed that I had hit the wrong button again.

I would never have done this intentionally.
