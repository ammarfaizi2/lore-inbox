Great work, its nice to see none, or fewer No help availables in the kernel 
configuration.
Some quick glances:

Linux Kernel v2.4.5-ac5 Configuration
CML1

Bottom of IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices;

< > Support Promise software RAID (NEW)   -> Help
There is no help available for this kernel option.

The Help for '[ ]   IGNORE word93 Validation BITS' isn't much help either, 
although I safely say N and move on.

Between SCSI and IEEE 1394;
Fusion MPT device support  --->     doesn't lead anywhere.
