Hence, Microsoft Windows. It might not be stable, it might not be fast, it
might not do RAID, packet-filtering and SQL, but it does a job. A simple
job. To give Mum & Dad(tm) (with apologies to maddog) a chance to use a
computer.

Since when, did mobile phones == computers?

So, let them stay in Win95. They don't *need* NT.

If your sister doesn't want that, give your sister a copy of Win95. If she
doesn't want that, she obviously wouldn't get any advantage out of Linux, as
opposed to Win95, whatsoever. Would she get a kick out of having to learn an
entirely new environment? Granted, I'm far more productive in GNOME,
Sawfish, emacs and mutt than Win95, Word and Outlook, but it takes people
time to get used to, and you'll have trouble dragging them out of
point-n-click.

If you don't want multiple users, don't add them. Just be content with root,
and give her root. It has multiple user capabilities, which should be used
under all circumstances, but if you don't want something, don't use it. You
have a choice.

My $au0.02. (which is apparently just over us1c now. oh joy).
