Hi,
I am working on VRRP and want to set multiple VIP <==> VMAC on a single
interface, is it possible

The mailing list had one thread long time back which was taking about a
kernel patch for this, but I don't if this is done or not.

What options do I have for doing the above?

Thanks,
Kalyanjeet Gogoi
