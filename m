The patches are available from:

	http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cachefs/

There's a patch-list.txt file in there with the patch descriptions and patch
names in order as well.

Also in there is dump-cachefs.c which can be used to peer into the depths of a
block device that has had cachefs mounted on it to see what's what.
