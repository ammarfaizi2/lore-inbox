Dear Sir,

RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL FOR US$18,200,000.00 (EIGHTEEN
MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND USD).

I am Mr.murray bruce, The Manager Accounting & Auditing
Department of the First National Bank, South Africa.
It is with utmost trust and confidence that I make
this urgent and important business venture to you. I
want your assistance and co-operation in carrying out
this business opportunity in my department. I
discovered an abandoned sum of US$18,200,000.00 (
Eighteen Million Two  Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) about R182,000,000.00 (One Hundred and Eighty
Two Million Rand) in a fixed deposit account that
belongs to one of our foreign customers who died in a
plane crash in November 1997.

Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim this
money because we cannot release the money unless
someone applies for it as the next of kin or relations
to the deceased as indicated in our banking
guidelines. Unfortunately, neither the family members
nor the relatives has appeared to claim the fund. Upon
this discovery, I and the assistance manager of my
department now decided to look for a foreigner who
will stand as the next of kin, and provide his account
then we will put up all the necessary document, do
changes where necessary thus to make you the bonafide
heir apparent to this money and transfer this money
into your account, since as a banker we are not
permitted to operate a foreign account. We don't want
this money to go into the bank treasurey as an
unclaimed funds as the banking law and guidelines here
stipulates that if such money remain unclaimed after
five years, the money will be transfered into the bank
treasury as an unclaimed fund.

To enable the immediate transfer of the fund to you as
indicated, you will first apply to the bank as a
relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating
your bank account number and location wherein the
money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply
fax, I will send to you by fax the text of the
application. As soon as you receive this letter,
Please, contact me immediately to indicate your
interest in this proposal via my private phone & fax
numbers stated above or preferably my above email
address.


Forward to me the details of your account or
preferably open a new account that can accomodate the
fund, your full name and address, private phone and
fax numbers for easy and urgent communication.

We are willing to offer to you an agreeable percentage
of 20% of the total sum, 10% has been mapped out for
expenses we are likely to incure during the course of
this transaction while 70% is for me and my colleague.
We are absolutely positive that this deal will be of
mutual benefit to us and also create room for future
business relationship. We expect you to treat this
with utmost confidentiality, trust and sincerity.

Thanking you for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. murray bruce
Manger (Accounting & Auditing FNB)
