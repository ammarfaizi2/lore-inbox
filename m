No, that would be a socalled defacto standard. Ie. not necessarily a standard 
proposed and recommended by a standards body. For instance, you may think that 
the UK using pounds and ounces is standard - after all they are both being 
used in real life. But it is contrary to the standard. (as given by the SI
system).
