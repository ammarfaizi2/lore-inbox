When i boot 2.4.21-rc7, i get the error:
Partition check:
 hda:end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 0
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 4
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 6
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 0
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 2
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 4
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 6
 unable to read partition table

after this, the system is able to mount a partition on this disk
properly. can anyone shed any light on this? This didn't happen with
pre3. btw, devfs is enabled, if that makes any difference. a config is
attached.
thanks...
