Larry, I develop for the Subversion project. Does that mean my license
to use bitkeeper is revoked?

I've also been wanting to use bitkeeper to create a Subversion mirror of
the kernel repository, but I suspect that my usage falls seriously into
this category, as my reasons for doing so are three-fold; allow access
to the bkbits repo to folks who don't want to use bk, but with all the
joys of an SCM (history, changesets, etc.); stress test Subversion
against a real-world high-activity repo; promote Subversion.

Would it be your intention that your license disallow my type of work? I
think it does.
