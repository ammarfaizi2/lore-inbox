Subject: Default to capability rather than dummy if no LSM is loaded
References: 40217, 39439

If a kernel is compiled with CONFIG_SECURITY to enable LSM, the
default behaviour changes unless a user load capability.
This is undesirable. This patch makes capability the default.
capability can still be compiled as module and be loaded as LSM.
If loaded as primary LSM, it won't change anything. But it can
also be loaded as secondary LSM.
Note that we could think of getting rid of dummy; however, it's
still used as fallback for stubs that are not implemented by an
LSM. I did not want to change this with this patch set, though
I'd like to see it done if everyone agrees it's a good idea.

This is patch 1/5 of the LSM overhaul.
