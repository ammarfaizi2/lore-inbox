Hi,

	I apologize if this subject is a bit out of context for this
emailing.

	I'm looking for a way to debug a driver that's for a STRONGARM
platform.  Is anyone aware of a tool that will enable me to step through the
kernel & driver code to debug/develop?

	Any info is appreciated.  

	Thanks!

	

Edwin Bland, EE
