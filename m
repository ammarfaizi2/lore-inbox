That is so damn true. Larry, for example, was unemployed and
without job prospects when he read my book, "The one minute OS
developer". He immediately got a job at Sun designing operating
systems including kernels and the more important stuff, like
"fortune".  Nearly anyone can pick this up. Val Henson's mom even 
learned to write operating systems when she found knitting 
and the Black-Scholes theorem too challenging. 
Once you have the 
difference between tabs and spaces down, the rest is a joke.
