i have a corvus 20meg drive and a xebec 10meg that both still spin up. those
are from mid to late 80s. i have seagate hawks from '94 that still work, but
quantums from the same period are all dead. the difference is that newer
drives have much tighter tolerances and are much more sensitive to dust. it
varies from drive to drive, of course.
