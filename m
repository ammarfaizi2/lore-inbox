Subject: [PATCH 0/2] computone: driver status update
X-Authentication-Info: Submitted using SMTP AUTH at out005.verizon.net from [209.158.211.53] at Fri, 29 Oct 2004 20:43:11 -0500

Computone was bought out by Altura XL.  I sent an email to both
mhw@wittsend.com and support@alturaxl.com on 10/22/04, and have
not received any response.

An email to linux-computone@lazuli.wittsend.com also got no response.

Since I could not find any submissions by the maintainer fixing
the code recently (the only 2.6 cleanup I could find was some
module-init stuff by Adrian Bunk), I'd call it orphaned in 2.6.
