Just a thought...  What would be the viability of buying someone elses
low end card design?  Would anyone in the market place be willing to
part with one of their old 2D chipsets with the understanding that it
would be developed and optimized for open source applications?  I
would probably start with a chip maker who has some video chipsets,
but is moving away from it because they don't have the market share
they want...

It's probably crazy, but it doesn't hurt to look around.
