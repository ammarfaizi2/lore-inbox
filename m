We don't convert it to a NAK, it comes as a NAK byte from the controller
(generated by the controller), and with the timeout flag set.

It probably would, but it also would slow down the detection. I think we
can simply ignore bytes with the timeout flag set in the atkbd_interrupt
function when we're not expecting an ACK/NAK.
