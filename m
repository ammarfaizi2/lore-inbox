Hello,

My name is kingsley Johnson from United Kingdom. I work as
a consultant for a BEAUTY CONCEPT in UK.
I will like to know if you can work online from
Home/Temporarily and get paid weekly?
Your task is to coordinate payments from customers and
help us with the payment processing.

We are glad to offer you a job position in our
company. We need a Male or Female representative in
the United States of America or Any other part of the
World that can work for the company as a
Representative/Book keeper. This is in view of our not
having an office presently in your country. You don=92t
need to have an Office and this certainly won't
disturb any form of work you have going on at the
moment.

We have sales representatives all over the world to
distribute our products. It is not easy to start a
business in a new market (new countries). About 90
percent of our customers prefer to pay through
Certified Cheques, Money orders and wire transfer
based on the amount involved.

Your tasks are;
1. Receive payment from Customers
2. Cash Payments at your Bank
3. Deduct 10% which will be your percentage/pay on
Payment processed.
4. Forward balance after deduction of percentage via
Western union or Money gram.

Then you will receive another payment immediately from
other clients and i am sure this will favor to you so
much.

Reply me with these details below as soon as possible
if you are interested.

Full Name..............

Address................

Mobile Number..........

I will await your immediate response.

kindly reply to kingskerry@yahoo.co.uk

Best Regards,

KingSley Johnson (Foreign Transaction Officer).
