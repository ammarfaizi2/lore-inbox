I've been testing AIO using Andrew's -mm kernels which includes
many AIO patches.  I've written some copy tests using AIO.

The libaio-0.3.93.tar ball has source to the library and man pages.
What kind of examples are you looking for?

I do not think AIO supports sockets, yet.  I would ask on the
linux-aio mailing list.

There was an interesting paper from the 2003 Linux Symposium on AIO:
