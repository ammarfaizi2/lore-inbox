Hi, Team

I am useing a dynamic address to access the cable modem. But I cann't establishe the eth0 interface. It looks I didn't receive a address. The ethernet card is connected to a cable modem.

The second question is I recompiled the kernal which included Crystal sound card. And it passed when system boot. But I cann't get any voice service.

Would anybody kindly help me?



Sincerely Yours,
