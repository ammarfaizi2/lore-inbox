Fahrenheit units were developed by a different process than Celsius, but
they are both "natural". The Celsius scale is 0 = freezing point of
water and 100 = boiling point of water. The Fahrenheit scale was
developed less precisely -- 0 is approximately the freezing point of
human blood, IIRC, and 100 is approximately body temperature (Fahrenheit
may have had a fever :)).
