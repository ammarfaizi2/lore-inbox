} The rest of this thread will show you that this is not a "Red Hat
} thing".  Connectiva, Mandrake, and others do the same thing.  In fact
} we choose the name "kgcc" to match the convention set by these other
} distributions.

Good to see RedHat isn't a trail-blazer of ingenuity and will follow the
herd off the cliff.  I'm "kgcc" agnostic, but your argument is weak.

Since you're setting yourself up as a proponent of this can you explain why
RedHat includes a compiler that doesn't work with the kernel?  Don't get
grumpy about who did it first or what the old one is named but be clear
what I'm asking.  I want to know if the 'gcc' on RedHat 7.0 fixes some
problems that the older compilers suffered from?  If there's a good reason
for the new compiler that breaks with the kernel then great, it makes
sense.  If it wasn't needed, then it's incredibly stupid.
