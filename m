What kernel are you using??  I used to get it after I switced from a
Linux-supported winmodem to a hardware modem, but the messages are now
mysteriously absent from me logs.  If you're running something prior to
2.4.5, I'd say it was fixed there.  Also, it could've been fixed in
Alan's tree; I'm running 2.4.5-ac2
