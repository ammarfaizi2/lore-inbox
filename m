Sigh...  That stops working at the same point where pyramid does - when
number of recepients becomes a sufficiently large fraction of all potential
participants.  It is not sustainable.

Simple math: Debian got several thousand developers.  Most of the packages
contain both contributions from said developers and stuff from upstream.
By very conservative estimates it's tens of thousands.  If your $10 is
per package update - it's impossible to pay.  _Really_ impossible - on a
reasonable system it will easily amount to $50 _daily_.  If it's $10 per
year - count the number of installations and look how much it will give
for one developer.

It won't work for the same reason why pyramids are unsustainable - when
you have too many recepients, both go to hell.  And there _is_ too many
for that to work.
