Hello!

I'm trying to get in contact with the developer(s) of the drivers of the
above stated controllers? Anyone knows a valid email address - the
address in sym53c8xx.h is invalid...

Anyone can help me?
I'm trying this since I'm experiencing heavy problems since upgrade from
kernel 2.6.3 to 2.6.5.

Any help or clue appreciated,
Eddy
