Err, music, computers: Just spend a lot of time to get a series of thin 
clients running sound over a DSL network (now in testing phase, need to solve 
some network problems first :-( )

I think the idea for a good sound card is good too, I am only thinking 
different about the manufacturing. Ordering 100 cards is not going to be 
attractive in any way with price, then just use the conexant wrappers for 
windows drivers, and run your card that way. GPL is one issue, wallet content 
is the next following important issue.
Wireless cards have to go cheaper all the time. One way to scrape of another 
50cents of the manufacturing cost is by using an open developed card en 
driver. That way the card will lie in many stores and is easily obtainable 
for everybody.
The extra encryption will get the phreaks on board with it, so spreading the 
idea of open source development even further, plus it is also a show and tell 
to the market like: Open source groups are innovative, and not just copycats 
who want everything for free (like in wallet content).

Firewire or USB: I do not care for an antenna for the simple reason that I 
just want a powercord (-:
