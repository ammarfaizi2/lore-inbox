Well, I don't know the quality of German's, but I know German's have
much of localized message :) However, imagine other languages.  The
quality control of localized translation can know only people who are
ready for that language. I think it's the problem.

Well, such a mechanism is also needed whenever if we have official
translation system (like DDTS - Debian Description Translation System).
