His research sucks.

: Later, the LGPL has been created and parts of the GCC (libgcc) has
: been put under LGPL.

Wrong. It is trivial to check gcc/libgcc*c and observe that libgcc is
*not* LGPLed, but licensed under the GPL plus an exception permitting
unrestricted linkage to proprietary software. (Related exceptions are
used for the libstdc++ headers and the Ada runtime.)

Just before that, he said:

: This acceptance has not been present from the beginning. In the
: beginning, the whole GCC has been published under the GPL and thus could
: not be used to compile software that itself has not been published under
: the GPL. For this reason, there has been an excited discussion about the
: usability of GCC.

Note that in Joerg's worldview, a mistake equals conspiracy. This is a
classic kook's mindview. Jeff's right: the best thing we can do is to
just ignore him.
