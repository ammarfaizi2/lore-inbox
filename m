I was able to extract the .doc file from the executable without
running it[1] so I am not bound by any license (there is no license
involved in downloading it, nor in the document itself). I produced a
.pdf using OOo 1.9.122. I would put it online, but the document's
first page reads:

"""
For Review and Discussion Only
Draft Document Subject to Revision or Rejection
Not For Publication or General Distribution
"""

so I'm still not sure if I can pass it on or not.
