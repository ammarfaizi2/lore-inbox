What I had in mind was having BK refuse to build changesets on top of
more than 3 month old changesets.  So you would get a 3 month window
in which to play around and either kill it, leave it alone, or
publish it.

I'm not sure it's going to work, I think people have a legit point 
that there are legit uses for which this doesn't work.
