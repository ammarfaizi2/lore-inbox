I've ran through a lot of search trying to find out how to get it
working. As you may already know, this smartcard reader comes
'out-of-the-box' with this socket A motherboard.

As long as it comes with a special cable which connects it directly to
the motherboard, i'm not sure which kind of interface (e.g., is it pci,
serial interface?) do i have to configure, or even if it has kernel
support.

Anyone can point me to some useful documentation, resources or whatever?
If there's no kernel support but technical docs, i'll consider to start
developping that device driver.

Thanks in advance,

Alvaro Hernandez
