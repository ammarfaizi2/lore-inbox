Hello,

I have to upgrade one of our linux-based routers to gigabit. What GE
card do you recommend for using with dot1q vlans? I tried a D-Link one
(DGE550SX, based on a Level1 chip) and an Intel one that works with the
e1000 driver, but I couldn't set up vlans properly with either of these.

thanks in advance
endre
