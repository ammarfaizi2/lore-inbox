I managed to find Greg Ganger this afternoon (he and I are on somewhat 
different schedules) --- as I suspected, his students are working on 
exokernel disk drivers, not Linux.  The discussion did get his interest; he 
dug up a linux-kernel archive to see what was going on and made some 
positive comments about it.

Anyone who's seriously interested in developing an "adaptive" Linux disk 
driver might want to drop a note to ganger@ece.cmu.edu.  Note that I do mean 
*seriously* interested.  In particular, questions as to when such a driver 
might be available won't be accepted kindly; he might well be interested in 
helping someone else write one, but he won't write one himself.
