    If someone answers me something like "you are much of a dumb for
understanding the answer, so I'll just tell you that you're wrong"
(and believe me, that 'joke' about a well earned F in Unix 101 falls
in this category IMHO), I wouldn't bother to thank...

    Most of the replies were polite, anyway, but some not ;)
