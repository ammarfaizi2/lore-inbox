I own a Laptop with an ATI Radeon Mobility M6 LY.
I found out that the radeonfb in the 2.5-kernels are totally outdated. WHen is an update of them expected?
The one in 2.4 is also not the most current, it doesn't contain fixes i need to get the framebuffer running.

The only working radeonfb is currently in the ac-kernels.
When is it expected to see it in 2.4 and 2.5-kernels?

cu,
Hanno Boeck
