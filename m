If your employer can't run a decent mail system - they lock you into crap
clients, don't add X-rbl-warning headers for ORBS-listed hosts, or they
can't manage to set up a reliable and efficient mail system - or maybe you'd
just be embarrassed to post to technical fora from a domain with only one MX
record - then just don't use it. Use a personal account elsewhere for all
mail which isn't strictly confidential.

It works for me.
