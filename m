hi all.
having problems with 2.4.20 still, my error is as follows:
(copied off screen)
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k block-major-3, errno = 02
vfs: cannot open root device "341" or 03:41

my understanding of block major 3 is that it is hdb, is this correct?
if so, why does it look for such a module, when ide support is compiled
into the kernel
specifically, support for via82cxxx
attached is my .config
thanks for your help.
