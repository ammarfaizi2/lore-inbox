Of course there are. If you are only talking about a stack, I believe that
people are working on the ieee80211 stack specifically and if you are
talking about supported adapters, just go to Network Devices and Wireless
and you should see several drivers there to load into the kernel.

I really don't understand your question, So I'm assuming that you want to
know if Linux has support for wireless cards.

Google can help you further.
