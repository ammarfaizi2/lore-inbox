Hello,
   I have kernel 2.4.17 and abi 2.4.17 patch
I have used aplication (oracle sqlforms30, runmenu for sco 5, coff).
Hardware is Compaq Proliant 1600 with 2 processors.
If I use kernel with one processor all is ok, but with SMP kernel
I have problem.
Application work btw one hour and then I get segmentation fault.
I am tried unload moduls and load again without success.
After reset all work one hour ...

Please help

haris peco
