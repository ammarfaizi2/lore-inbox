Good.

That certainly shouldn't be the case (and isn't on any of my setups). Is
the behaviour identical same on both the PIII and the Opteron systems?

As for the WRITE rates, could you send me a short tcpdump from the
"sequential write" section of the above test? Just use "tcpdump -s 90000
-w binary.dmp"  just for a couple of seconds. I'd like to check the
latencies, and just check that you are indeed sending unstable writes
with not too many commit or getattr calls.

Cheers
