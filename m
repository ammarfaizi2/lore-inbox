Hi

I would like to announce the creation of the openlvm mailing list for
discussion about maintenance and further development of the Linux
Logical Volume Manager (LVM).

The new mailing list is named linux-openlvm and hosted at
nl.linux.org, you can subscribe to the list by posting to
majordomo@nl.linux.org and postings should go to
linux-openlvm@nl.linux.org. The list is unmoderated and open to
postings from individuals who are not subscribed to the list as it is
good practice for all open development lists.

We have found it necessary to create the new list as the current LVM
development proces is closed and does not take input from the
community. We have experienced numerous incidents of postings to the
old mailing list with patches, on topic questions and comments about
the LVM code that have been rejected by the list moderator. We find
this completely unacceptable just as it is hindering development that
a development mailing list is being so mismoderated.

Please welcome the new list and join in on the development and
discussions.

Sincerly,
Jens Axboe
