Hi all.

I want to get some feedback. I'm considering making a tree/patchset
aimed at the desktop user: Linus kernel + PM, USB and so on patches,
Win4Lin patches and perhaps [I/O] scheduler improvements.

What do people think?

Regards,

Nigel

Everyone lives by faith. Some people just don't believe it.
Want proof? Try to prove that the theory of evolution is true.
