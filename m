Here I thought we had Republicans fighting to make the US a republic and
Democrats fighting to make it a Democracy. Oh well, my mistake. Can
someone start a seperate mailing list maybe linux-kernel-legal. It would

other that effect the kernel hackers. As a bonus it wouldn't distract from
the patches.
