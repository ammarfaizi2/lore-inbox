True, I have recently checked some out, although I'm not up to date on 
everything there.

Hey yeah ;-)  I pay attention to things like USB drivers.  I couldn't 
get a driver for my DSL modem that came with my broadband connection, 
so I ditched my broadband connection and now use a crappy old 56K 
connection.  Hell, that's sticking by your principles, even if it's 
painful.  ;-)

Sometime in future, when I can afford that ADSL modem that doesn't 
need a binary only driver or one written under an NDA...
