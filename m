I'm new to all this with kernel hacking, so writing any drivers would be 
quite difficult for me i think.
I'm just trying to learn where to start, and what to start with, I'm not 
a guru in C, but I'm learning ;)
But if anyone have a driver which need some looking after I could gladly 
look at the TODO or something :)
