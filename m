Hi,
  I went to check what's the status of this. I tested 2.6.10-rc3-bk8
on the same machine, and the parent process still get's killed.
The last patch Thomas has posted to the list in this thread for 2.6.10-rc2-mm3
killed only the application. Maybe it's still in -mm tree?
Anyway, here are results for 2.6.10-rc3-bk8 as I've said:

Out of Memory: Killed process 6863 (xterm).


I see the machine a lot less responsive when it starts swapping
compared to 2.6.10-rc2-mm3. For example, just moving mouse between
windows takes some 10-12 seconds to fvwm2 to re-focus to another xterm
window.
