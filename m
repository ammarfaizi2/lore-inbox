What patches in the -ac kernels get put into the mainstream kernel? For
instance, I would assume that fixes in 2.6.0-test1-ac1 would make it into
2.6.0-test2, but I'm not sure how that works, surely no one is just dropping
those fixes and not applying them at some point to the mainline kernels. So
I guess my question is, at what point does Linus' tree sync with Alan's?
