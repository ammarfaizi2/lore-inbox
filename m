Why are you sending this things after 4 years. This looks like sexual 
pills spam. And I can't believe, "agencies" are contacting you for this 
thread for the last 4 years... If they are, REALLY ask for the thread to 
be removed or something like that.

Also, this email only showing your username without the Full name, looks 
like if someone is trying to use your account again... ;-)

If they are really harassing you, ask for the thread to be removed. (I 
dunno the policy about this)
