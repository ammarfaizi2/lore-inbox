I pick out _one_ piece of code that _one_ random person posts publicly
(so, it happens to be one of the leaders of the free open source world)
and suddenly I'm a zealot.  I'm a nobody and proud of that fact.   I was
just explaining my dislike of a particular code structure based on my
earlier training and experience.

In the time since my writing of that post and your response, though, I
have since been "Enlightenned" by all of the wonderful people on this
discussion forum.
