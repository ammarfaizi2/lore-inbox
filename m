Hmm good question.. 

Probably because the last list mails in my inbox are from feb 20th and
dont answer this question. Dont know why I didnt get the mail.. ill have
to check.

And I see from the website that we are continuing the 2.4 series  so no
need to answer that.
 But as I said.. whats up with 2.4.18 on the websites? if its fixed 
could someone remove that update notice in the changelog ?

And Mr, Hahn should probably get out from under the neutrinos, he seems
a bit testy today.

My apologies to all for my redundancies.

Madhav
