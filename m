Jeff,

I do not understand what this means.  Just because they did not volunteer it
does not imply some sort of conspiracy.  There are a lot of patches I make
locally for my work, but I don't just throw everyone of them out to the 
whole planet since a lot of them would probably get rejected, and most folks
probably could care less.  At any rate, I was not being an obstructist 
or anything.  Perhaps they overlooked it or perhaps it's available 
somewhere else.  Simplest approach is always the best -- just ask them
and post to LKML so they know other folks are probably interested.

Some of the patches I;ve made to Alan's code I am certain he would look 
at and say something like "well there's goes Jeff again smoking his
pipe" or something -- but of course only in the nicest sort of way.

:-)
