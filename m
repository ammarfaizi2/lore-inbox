I'm experiencing hard rand lockups using kernel 2.6.0: they are not
predictable, nor I can find a way to reproduce them. They can occur
while working with an app, while browsing the fs (I use KDE) or
while resuming after the screensaver, or anything else. They can
occur after one hour or 15 minutes, and there's not any strange
"jerkiness" activity before, nor an intense disk work.

After the hang, the disk starts working for a while, then I have
to reset w/button, and nothing is left on the various system logs.

These hangs did not occur in 2.5 up to .75, but they come also
with 2.6.0-mm1 (and plain 2.6.0-t1). I had a doubt about the
soundcard, I've applied latest 0.9.6 alsa patch: the hangs are less 
frequent but still there.

Here attached the lspci output and .config.

Bye
