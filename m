I've just run your tests on my desktop and with max_ia_bonus at its 
default value I see the "delta = 3" with 20 threads BUT when I set 
max_ia_bonus to zero they stop (in both "eb" and "pb" mode).  So I then 
reran the tests with 60 threads and zero max_ia_bonus and no output was 
generated by your testdelay script in either "eb" or "pb" modes.  I 
didn't try "sc" mode as I have a ZAPHOD kernel loaded (not HYDRA) but 
Con has reported that the problem is absent in his latest patches so 
I'll update the "sc" mode in HYDRA to those patches.
