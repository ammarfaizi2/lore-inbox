It is not the server. I have a server for them. I think many do not realise
how much time Jon & friends spend on making LWN, and it is precisely this
*time* that sets them apart from everything else.

Compare them to a Linux dedicated Theregister.co.uk - real journalism with
analyses that go beyond what is provided by CmdrTaco (entertaining though he
may be) and their like.

In order to make LWN, they need to find a way to give them the time to work
on it. They can't do it next to a day job.

Regards,

bert
