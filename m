I hope no one minds me posting this, but one of the members of the Open 
Graphics mailing list put a petition online where people have been 
voting on their opinions for price, etc.

The Open Graphics main page is:

http://lists.duskglow.com/mailman/listinfo/open-graphics

And the petition can be found at:

I think this poll may be quite revealing as to the proportion of people 
who would be interested in this product.  Given the proportion of people 
who would pay $100 and those who would pay $200, if the price fell 
somewhere between them, I'd say it's more than feasible.

So for those who thought the project died... think again.  :)
