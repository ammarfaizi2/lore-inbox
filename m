I think it can go away quickly. It just a matter of how you want to 
address it.

The license on the whole is a good license. It's just that one claus 
the gives me pause.

And that's perfectly fair. However as worded in your license today, the 
individuals who work for those companies and have nothing to do with 
the competitive software you are worried about can't use your product 
to work on open source software.

If we can fix this problem somehow, I would be a very happy camper.

How about this:

(d) Notwithstanding any other terms in this License, this License *MAY* 
not
be available to you if you and / or your employer develop, produce, 
sell,
and/or resell a product which contains substantially similar 
capabilities
of the BitKeeper Software or in the reasonable opinion of BitMover, 
competes
with the BitKeeper Software.

For those individuals who work on Open Source Software, that is software
as defined by being under a license meeting the Open Source Definition 
as
defined on www.opensource.org, may apply for a waiver to 
<someuser@bitmover.com>
stating
1) Which company they work for
2) Which Open Source Project(s) they are going to be using the 
Bitkeeper software for
3) Identify if they are working on this project in their "free" time or 
as part of their
job definition

If granted the waiver will only cover the stated Open Source project(s) 
you have named. If you expand your use of the BitKeeper software to 
other Open Source project(s) you will need to apply for a waiver for 
those project(s) as well.

It is good to hear that you're open to being flexible. I hope that 
might include
this case as well.

Well if you would, please have a read, Hopefully my idea sounds 
reasonable to you.

Thanks
