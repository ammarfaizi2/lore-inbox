Well, for example, add a new pointer to indicate the driver accessing
exclusively.  And pci_enable_device() (maybe a new variant would be
better for compatibility) checks whether this is free.

The second caller wouldn't reach even to pci_request_regions() because
of this check.  So, no side-effect of pci_disable_device() in the
error path.
