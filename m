Further to that, I followed Alan's lead and installed xfce.  My laptop, which 
was really suffering under Gnome with 64 meg (much more so under KDE) is 
suddenly light on its feet.  Not to mention that it built from source in 
under 10 minutes and installed with zero 'interesting problems'.

After another year of optimizing the kernel to handle bloatware better, and 
at the same time encouraging the 'big desktop' side of Linux to follow the 
lead of these lightweight alternatives[1] we will be looking pretty good.
