Its somewhat naiive. If you have a hole in a bridge and someone tells you
that for stability you can only paint the bridge and tighten bolts you will
still have a very broke bridge. Ditto with software.

2.2.20 is stable because its been slowly refined to that and is now at the
point where on the hole the painting and bolt tightening is all that needs
doing. The 2.4 tree suffered serious earthquake damage in 2.4.10 which
hasn't entirely been fixed yet.
