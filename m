  Sorry to bother you kernel hackers. I have a simple question.

I am about to buy a new AMD Athlon system and I want to make sure I get 
 the hardware that works best with Linux. I am wondering whether I 
should get a nForce 2 or KT600 based motherboard. Specifically, I am 
looking at

Asus A7N8X-X
http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socketa/a7n8x-x/overview.htm
nForce 2
Realtek ALC650 sound card
Realtek 8201BL network card

and

Gigabyte GA-7VT600-P-L
http://www.giga-byte.com/MotherBoard/Products/Products_GA-7VT600-P-L.htm
Northbridge : VIA KT600
Southbridge : VIA VT8237
Realtek ALC655 AC97 sound card
Realtek 8101L NIC


My primary requiremnet is that it must work well with Linux. I can 
handle downloading & installing drivers. If it works out of the box 
(without downloading binary drivers) that's even better. I am also 
planning to get GeForce FX graphics card, if it makes a difference. So 
which board is more compatibile?

thanks in advance,

Eugene
