After updating my bk tree this morning, I am getting the 
following compile error:

4d13d7e9 A __crc_page_states__per_cpu not in per-cpu section
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

Although if I type 'make' again then the compile completes
with no problems, and I have to problems running the new
kernel.  

I see there is a mail thread about a per_cpu patch, but I 
couldn't find anyone reporting this problem.  Anyone have
a clue what this is?
