Obviously there has to be some standard base
with which to work, especially for computer language
keywords as these can't be converted due to name
clashes. What would be cool is to pick a better base
language than English that everyone would have to
learn to "use computers". This is especially important
for opensource as it would greatly ease the operation
of the collective brain. Something easily parseable
would be an obvious criterion and would allow us
to interact with computers by voice(-recognition)
with no ambiguity, etc. etc...

will everything be changed over in the 2.5 timeframe? :-)
