Hi all,

I need to clarify the following points.

1. Has somone already ported Linux to TX4927 chip?
2. If not, what is the complexity of this wor?
3. If yes, then who is maintaining it. We could not get any information from
the source tree.
4. If yes, is it an open source? where can I get the source code.

Thanks in advance
Santhosh K
