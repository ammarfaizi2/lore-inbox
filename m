I have this exact same laptop.  It works perfectly for me with linux. 
Originally started with a 2.4 kernel and recently went to 2.6.10.  The modem
works well, the video card works well even with 3D accel.  I replaced the
original 30gb hdd with a 40gb (for space reasons).  The only complaint about
this thing I have is the fact they used an nvidia video chip.  I have seen
more than 4 months uptime on it (I used to use it as a desktop)

I did have a hardware mouse problem, but replacing the touchpad/palm rest
fixed that.  I'd give it a 4 star (out of five, mainly because of the video
chipset and the keyboard layout)
