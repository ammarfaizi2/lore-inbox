This may be a SGI question...

After upgrading to kernel-2.4.14-SGI_XFS_1.0.2 I can no longer connect to 
www.zdnet.com. I can connect to any other web site. 

I've tried kde konqueror-2.2.2-1, netscape-communicator-4.77-0.6.2, 
netscape-navigator-4.77-0.6.2, netscape-communicator-4.78-2, and the latest 
release of opera. 

I've used rpm to verify all depends. I get no error messages anywhere that I 
can find. If I boot to winsucks98 I have no problem(boo) so I know its not a 
firewall problem. Does anyone have any ideas what the problem may be or a way 
to figure out whats happening? Someone I work with suggested process 
accouting.

Thanks!
