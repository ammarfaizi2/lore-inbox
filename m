  i've noticed references to "test suites" for kernels, but
is there any one-step convenient way to select every possible
option for test-compiling a new kernel, just to see if it builds?
perhaps an "everything" option?

  and, related to that, should such a kernel theoretically
work?  as in, are there any options that would be mutually
exclusive that would cause such a build to fail?

still thinking about reorganizing the overall option structure,
