I guess the latter.  Imagine that the stuff already exists in mm tree 
but the merge to the maintree is delayed.  In this case,
KERNEL_VERSION check doesn't work reliably.  But, it's a rare case,
AFAIK.

Here I agree with Greg.  It'll be difficult to remove it once after
added.  Nobody knows whether the external stuff still refers to it or
not...

ALSA, for example, still offers for 2.2, 2.4 and older 2.6 kernels.
So it requires checks for such kernel API changes.  I would do this
via autoconf without problem if HAS_* isn't introduced, though.
