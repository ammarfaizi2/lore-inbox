As if this wasn't contentious enough already, let me throw out something
for your consideration.

Q:  When are *developers* most in need of stable models?
A:  During development.

There's a fundamental problem here.  Developers want complete freedom to
change their own models whenever they feel the need, yet the models on
which they depend must remain stable if their development is to continue
without interruption and they get snarly when those models change.

MS Windows *is* user-friendly, but only for certain values of "user".
