And you didn't like youu for "you and only you" too!

For the benefit of any of you trying your hand at fixing typos and
spelling, please make sure you're not "fixing" accepted British or
Canadian spelling.  See

Many others can be found by Googling.  Hmm, my spelling checker doesn't
like googling yet.
