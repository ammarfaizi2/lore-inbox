Of course its probably something to do with init,
but does anyone know whats going wrong? whats system.map
actually for, Im using a vanilla 2.5.54 and MDK9.0.
:(
Of course im probably opening my self up to lines like
"thick twat wouldn't know a devel kernel if he was electrocuted from pissing on the pc that held one.."

Now i know why I preferred 2.4, I could get it working.
:)
