Hi all.

I'm delighted to announce that I've accepted a call to serve a congregation=
 in=20
Victoria, Australia, as a Home Missionary elder. As a result, some time in=
=20
the next month or two, I will stop working for Cyclades and make the move.

Users of Suspend2 can rest assured that I will not allow the patches to suf=
fer=20
bitrot. I will be continuing to use them myself, and will therefore have th=
e=20
best of incentives to keep them up-to-date.

Now for the downside: I won't, however, be making any sort of concerted eff=
ort=20
at getting them merged into the vanilla kernel after my move, and am not=20
inclined to make a big effort beforehand. Recent discussions on LKML clearl=
y=20
showed that Pavel doesn't want to see them merged, and I didn't see much in=
=20
the way of other kernel developers expressing a desire contrary to Pavel's=
=20
wishes. I don't want to waste my time and effort, so I don't see the point =
to=20
doing anything but maintaining the patches as they stand.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Cyclades for their employment an=
d=20
support of the project.

Regards,

Nigel
