Please Erik,

Go have your "DADDY" write another legal letter for you and send it my
way.  I will be happy to shove it down your pie hole.

There is a difference in blanket theift of the kernel API and any court
will point out that "fair usage" is proper.

PS how is your IRS media forensics gig going now that you do not have me
on your side to help you do the dirty work of sneaking around people's
hard drives.  I was smart enough to never teach you what I knew you could
never learn.

Later!
