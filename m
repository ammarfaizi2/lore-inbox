 Not impossible ;)  Suppliers think end users are dumb until end users work
 out it's the suppliers that are dumb :)

 I confirm that XP chips aren't supported in smp configs by AMD.  I can't of
 the top of my head give URLs to confirm what I've just said, but I'l
rummage
 around and see if I can dig stuff up.  It's the MP chips that are supported
 in MP configs (unsurprisingly :))
