I think they hear it very often, but any letter of that kind gives only good and positive 
sense for really great developers, that creating Linux kernel every day.

I joined this list about a month and large part of messages can't understand, but there talk 
really clever developers and new knowledge flows in my brain with almost every new letter.
Looks only at discussion about ext3, much many interesting thinks one can get from this thread.
