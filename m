You were not very specific, so I have to guess that you're referring to
the problem of having two copies of the same file in RAM - one in the
page cache and one in the "backing store", which is just RAM.

There are two solutions to this problem.  One is tmpfs, which doesn't
use a backing store and keeps all data in the page cache.  The other is
xip, which doesn't use the page cache and goes directly to backing
store.  Unlike O_DIRECT, xip only works with a RAM or de-facto RAM
backing store (NOR flash works read-only).

So if you really care about memory waste in embedded systems, you should
have a look at mm/filemap_xip.c and continue Carsten Otte's work.
