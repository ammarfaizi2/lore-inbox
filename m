Having seen what taco hell passes for maxican food for the first time in
my life a few days ago, I think Alan eating taco hell would be a great
tragedy for a. his wife and b. linux. This... thing that my friend was
putting in his mouth was long, slimy and somewhat flaccid. It may or may
not have been a burrito. The jury is still out on that one.

I say Keep Alan Taco Hell Free! ;)
