I don't think he did that at all :
(Devil's Advocate time :)

What he did was say that, while everyone was looking
at Linux as the solution to modern computing problems,
he didn't need to : he already has Solaris.  So Solaris
is his "Linux".

A matter of grammar, not legal or technical terms : he
didn't say that Solaris IS linux; he used a metaphor :
"[Solaris] is our implementation of Linux".

I'm not saying he's RIGHT : I'm just saying that he
didn't intend to abuse the Linux trademark.  He's
taken a mix of (B) and (C) from above, claiming that
his Solaris product can accomplish the same product
targets that Linux does.

Why should Sun provide anything for Linux if they
already have Solaris providing all of the functionality?

Could I say that Wine is my Windows implementation?  Windows
is a trademark, but everyone knows what I mean, right?
Microsoft's not going to be writing me any letters, right?
(well, none that I'm going to pay attention to, right? :)

All just rhetoric, of course.
Advocacy doesn't belong on linux-kernel :)
