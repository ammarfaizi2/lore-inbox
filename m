Hi,

I noticed discussion of the various Via KT133A chipset problems related
to 
Athlon optimized kernels has trailed off. Are people successfully using 
the patch that Alan Cox posted, or are there still problems? 

I just ran into this last night (I thought all the Athlon chipset bugs
had 
been fixed in 2.4.4 prior to last night). 

Anyway, just requesting status, and I'll gladly offer any testing help 
that's needed. 

====

  Actually it appears that I cut cut off from the kernel list :).  Hmm
did I say something wrong? :).  Seriously, there has not been any change
by me... I'm running 2.4.4 with the athlon-specific fast_page_copy
TURNED OFF.
My system is very stable, though I'm sad that I can't get the
performance
out of my system as I should... I guess it may be time to look for
another
M/B that does not exhibit these problems...
