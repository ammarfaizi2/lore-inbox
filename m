And my point is that by making such a public, far-reaching interpretation of
the GPL, a lawyer in court could argue that his interpretation should be THE
interpretation.  I believe that judges have made interpretations of a law based
solely on how the law is practiced, to avoid situations where everyone affected
by that law has to change what he's doing.
