Or, just ask.  Larry has always been (or given the appearance of being)
open to handling special cases/requests reasonably[1].  Seriously, do you
think BM would turn down a "Er, we didn't see this coming, is it OK for us
to use our free-licensed BK one more time to export to SCCS or whatever? 
We promise there won't be a guy from the SCM team shoulder-surfing or
tcpdumping while we do so" request?  If they *did* turn down a reasonable
request, *then* maybe there would be something legitemate to flame them
about.

[1] Of course, the definition of "reasonable" will now be debated to death.
