If you start a project, that doesn't mean the "fork" is bad as long as 
the intention is to integrate the work back into the base.

What you are asking for is for people to add to their list of things to 
code.  You should be adding code yourself.

Linux has many groups of people pushing and pulling it in numerous 
directions.  Very rarely does a direction succeed if the people who want 
that specific direction don't submit code.

Useful discussion would be asking for implementation suggestions to get 
to your goal.  Oh wait, I think there are already some of those in this 
thread.
