I'm glad you asked.  When you log in then you can moderate 
the bugs as a bug or not a bug.  I am going to make that 
more obvious, by adding "Login to moderate" next to each 
bug when you look at the source.

Tracking bug moderations from one version to the next is 
basically working since 2.5.63.

thanks,
dan carpenter
