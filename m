Hello,
don't you know, if anybody writes these? I found usagi project, where 
these 2 are implemented, but it seems like dead project in this way. 
ipvs (lvs) is derived from ipvs for ipv4 version 0.9.8 (it was written 
in 2002). I found some patches from 2004 for conntrack, but i can't find 
anything usable. So if you have some info, please post.
Why am I asking? One of masters at our university give this as one of 
possible bachelor thesis (and I want to know if I can start working ;) ).

And... does exist as good book as ldd for the networking.

Thanks for your replies.

regards,
jiri
