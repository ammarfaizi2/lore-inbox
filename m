State Laws may be controlling if they involve contracts.  It has nothing 
to do with Copyright Law, but with the terms of license for someone's
code.  I've seen this crap applied.  I've even been on the receiving
end of it, and been enjoined from working on PUBLIC GPL CODE for 
18 months because of an AGREEMENT and not copyright laws.

Under inevitability, the neural impules in your brain can be ruled 
to be a derivative work.  Believe me, I am not arguing for the doctrine,
but informing you of it's existence and the broad scope it has 
in IP cases.

The legal limit is 18 months in most states.  This "I have a right to 
make a living argument" only holds water if the other side refuses to
post a bond.  If they post a large enough bond, a court WILL rule 
in favor of inevitability if they make a good case for it.  (The 
bond required to keep me from programming for 18 months cost Novell 
$10,000,000.00.)

US Judges are pontius pilate's all -- with hearts as black as the robes
they wear.  They don't care about you, or your rights.  Remember, almost
all judges are lawyers who are too old or to incompetent to practice law
so they get themselves an appointment.  Most of them were crooked lawyers
who went into politics (which is how a lawyer gets made into a judge, BTW,
he goes into politics).

It has to do with contract law, which is what the doctrine of 
inevitability is all about.  Trade secrets have nothing to do 
with it, it's a question of knowledge gained via access to 
code through some form of agreement.  In employment 
situations, it's a trade secret agreement, here in Linux, it's 
a GPL agreement.

I argued that looking at Novell Public Code under their form of GPL
would not contaminate -- a court ruled otherwise.  The court ruled 
that under inevitability, public code on Novell's website and 
slides presented at Brianshare, even though they were public, 
had the affect of contaminating our internal projects under 
this doctrine.  You don't want to kill all the lawyers, you want to 
kill all the judges -- it was a judge that came up with this 
inevitability doctrine in the first place....
