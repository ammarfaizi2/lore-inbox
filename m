It looks like we have a bad disk, I'm checking them now to figure out if 
it is the the primary or backup data drive.  I'll run checks in all the
repositories if fsck doesn't find the problem so it may take a couple of 
hours before we are back up.

In the not so distant future, we're moving the backup drive to a different
machine such that we can just flip machines when this happens but for now
you'll have to wait for a bit.
