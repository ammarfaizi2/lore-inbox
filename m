I am subscribed to several of the vger.kernel.org lists and the *same* 
spam gets dumped on each of them.
I have *no* problem whatsoever having the lists be open to posting so 
that anyone having a problem with
getting the kernel or other parts of Linux to work for them will be able 
to access the collective knowlege of
the community. But, my desktop machine is capable of identifying the 
garbage that gets dumped on the lists
without much problem. I am using a triple layered approach - 
SpamAssassin, SpamBayes, and SpamBouncer,
to filter all of my incoming mail. This approach works very well in that 
it has a miniscule false-positive rate, yet
catches all of the 419, phish, E-cards, etc, etc, etc, that get sent to 
the list. I am only an end-user in that I do
not control the mailservers that receive the spams from vger.kernel.org 
but my setup can certainly identify
without fail the junk sent through the lists. So my question is really, 
if my puny little end-user setup can determine
which messages sent to /whatever-list@/vger.kernel.org are spam, why 
can't the admins at vger.kernel.org
set up the same kind of filtering so that the junk never even gets into 
the outbound majordomo queue? I've
set up majordomo and I know how the internals work and how messages get 
run through the architecture.
I know it's possible to filter the incoming messages *to* majordomo. The 
spam is coming through majordomo
through the list. If you expand your MUA's view of the message so that 
you see all of the headers in the
message, you will see that the spammage goes through the same processing 
as any other legitimate message.
Your two-address scheme has other functionality in play to explain the 
difference in the number of spam message
are received. I am only talking about messages processed through 
majordomo@vger.kenel.org
