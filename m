In all honesty, Larry and I have a dislike for each other. I've emailed
him in private venting my frustration against him in the past. I wasn't
very nice at all. It's no surprise that he has a grudge against me.

His decision above is more of a power play against me to smack me down,
than anything else (something he's admitted to me in private email since
sending that email to the list). He got his payback.

Question is, if he shows a history of using license interpretation to
handle personal grudges, how long before he gets pissed at someone else
and inteprets his license in another way to toss around power over users
of his product...a way more damaging than simply losing ones right to
use BK freely.
