And I'd add something more along those lines..

Evolution and selection is about species, not individuals as its commonly
considered, so what might be bad for an individual (getting "screened" at
early ages) might be good for (reproduction of) the species (since it
ensures a better reproduction material quality)  Darwinian evolution doesnt
fit too well in the kernel.

On the other hand we can think of developers' minds as a copy-on-write DNA.
DNA knows when something wont work, so it doesn't try it.   Screening :)
