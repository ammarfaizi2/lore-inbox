Since I'm not a kernel expert and absolutely not a kernel hacker I'd like to 
submit my thoughts that may be proven usefull to all you maintainers. I 
believe there is a need for a message board that everyone could submit bugs 
of the kernel after being informed by a help file on how exactly this should 
be done. I really don't feel we, the kernel users, should spend your valuable 
time and post these here, as well as we need a help site that tells us how 
exactly we should submit our kernel issues. And anyway, to be informed how we 
can recognize what is actually a bug and what is a user fault from an easy to 
read web site.

I find it too difficult for us, the average kernel users, to have to read 
books and books of documendation - and eventually become hackers - when there 
would be a site that covers this step by step and doesn't need to much efford 
on research. Please let me know if you do care at all anyway, or you're only 
concerned about -your- bug discoveries (I'm not implying anything, let me 
add).

Anyway

- let me know.
