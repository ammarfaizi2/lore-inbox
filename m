Ha ha ha. Kernel development over.  That's rich.  I can't speak for the
Linux kernel developers; they're a vindictive group (and the "to-do"
list of their vision for future kernel development is no where to be
found).

However, I know Mach and GNU Hurd, which are both microkernels, have
plenty of room for low-level pioneers.

Personally, I think the most interesting aspects of kernel development
and research are taking place on microkernels.

Do both.  Or, ask yourself this: Would I rather do something I love and
risk being unemployed, or have plenty of job security with only
moderately entertaining tasks?  It's up to you, and maybe the job market
for kernel development isn't that bad.

Another aspect of computer science you might want to consider is
compilers; that's always low level, and they may need those people for
all those hand- held devices.
