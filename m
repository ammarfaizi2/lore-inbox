A 32 KB patch isn't considered terribly large for lkml.  For review
purposes, we had rather see patches inline in email instead of as
attachments or as URLs.  (Yes, I have posted URLs of patches when
they were 200 KB, e.g.)

I posted a patch for many corrections to relayfs.txt a few days
ago, including the change from you.

All of the corrections look good to me.
