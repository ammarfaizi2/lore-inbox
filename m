Regardless, nobody stopped him at that time and thus a right of way has
been granted and can not be revoked.

See above, the boss changed the rules and nobody challanged it.
It sticks like glue and we all have to suck up the point and move forward.

Sure, and I am out there proving the points that will undermine your
arguements.

Whatever happened to "World Domination" according to TUX ?
Whatever happened to 'having a choice' ?

Lets assume you are correct, and the effect is a "Tar Baby".

Your claims that anything which loads into a kernel is automatically a
derived work.  Thus the effect of an original work loading into a gpl work
force the original work to be GPL.  This is a joke and will never see a
second in any court.

Cheers,

Andre
