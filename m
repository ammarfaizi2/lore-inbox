    Independently of my opinion about the subject, you have send a
polite and very sensible answer to all the attacks you have received
(some of them very out of common sense, I must say...).

    Congratulations for your message. I was thinking that people are
more concerned of defending decisions that to really make
improvementes... Just look at the messages last week: many people
took a big effort to attack you verbally, but my patch to a nasty
(but maybe harmless) but have totally gone ignored...

    Keep on like that, Wayne ;)
