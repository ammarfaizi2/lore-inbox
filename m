I downloaded the U.S. Code of active Federal statutory law. That's the
legal corpus of the U.S. created at the Congressional level. That's not
regulations, which formally aren't from Congress. The U.S. Code is 50
Titles, with a few missing. It's about 71 meg gzipped as ASCII. No wonder
the country is going to hell :o) And the only part as twisted as kernel
code is the Internal Revenue Code.
