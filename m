Dear Friend. 
 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe =
everyone will die someday. My name is Mr. Samuel Williams, a merchant in =
Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer which was =
discovered very late, due to my laxity in carrying for my health. It has =
defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months =
to live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for =
anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never =
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as =
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know =
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in =
the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world =
I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.

Now that God ! has called me, I have willed and given most of my properties =
and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few =
close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I =
have decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succour and =
confort to the less priviledged in our societies, as I want this to be one of =
the last good deeds I do on earth.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, =
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot =
do this my self anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my =
accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization =
and to the less priviledged in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept =
the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not =
to be contended with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of  =
$24Million U.S.Dollars (twenty four million U.S.Dollars that I have with a =
Storage Company in Europe for safe keeping. I will want you to help me =
collect this deposit and disburse it to some charity organizations and to the =
less priviledged.

Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in this disbursement.=


I have set aside 20% for you for your time and patience. You can e-mail me =
at:swilly2004@netscape.net   

While I await to hear from you, may God be with you and your entire family.

Remain blessed.
Mr. Samuel Williams
