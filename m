Nobody wins in a lawsuit, at least not at this level.  I don't want to sue
you, that's nuts.  

If you continued use BK and were working on an SCM system, yeah, we'd kick
up a fuss.  Our position is that it was really hard to produce a system 
which doesn't suck and it is a lot easier to copy such a system than it is
to invent one on your own.  So we'd prefer you to figure it out on your 
own than copy what we have done.
