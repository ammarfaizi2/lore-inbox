Hmm, i don't really remember, but i don't think it was the case though.

Right now, i rebooted into 2.5.65-mm1 and put a serial console. I tried to reproduce the freeze
by doing approx. the same things: Right now the system has stable ( 2 hours uptime ) :)

Still, i had Pan hogging both CPUs for i don't know the reason, and i did experience
some xmms skips.

Thanks,

Philippe
