Subject: 2.6.10-rc3, syslogd hangs then processes get stuck in schedule_timeout

I'm still seeing this problem.  It repeats every week or week and a half, 
usually after logs have been rotated and a dvd has been written.  syslogd 
stops writing output, then everything that does schedule_timeout() hangs, 
the process table fills, and everything grinds to a halt.

If the problem is detected early enough, syslogd can be manually killed 
and restarted, unwedging everything and returning everything to normal 
operation.

I'm running 2.6.10-rc3, compiled with smp.  I've been seeing this since at 
least 2.6.8.1, both smp and nosmp.  userspace is debian testing.

sysrq+t output from three hangs in November with 2.6.9 is at 
http://hashbrown.cts.ucla.edu/deadlock/.

A gdb backtrace for syslogd from the latest hang shows

I can't repeat this at will, but it does seem to happen fairly frequently. 
How do I tell if this is a kernel problem or a userspace issue?  Is there 
anything I should look for to figure out why syslogd is causing everything 
else to block?

     was Re: deadlock with 2.6.9

I managed to get access to the system while it was exhibiting the problem. 
There are two cron processes both in D state.  I was not able to attach to 
either process with gdb.  /proc/pid/wchan showed do_fork for both processes.

I was able to 'killall -9 cron' and kill all of the cron tasks.

I had several other processes that /proc/pid/wchan showed in unix_wait_for_peer 
(sshd), futex_wait (syslogd), and do_exit (zombie sshd).

When I killed syslogd, the zombie sshd processes disappeared and everything 
started magically working again.
