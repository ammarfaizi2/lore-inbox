Andre isn't the only one that does this. It seems many people enjoy 
blocking people with access to only one smtp server. Esspecialy when 
that server is on a very small, isolated ISP, or an ISP that people 
just ASSUME is up to bad things.

David Weinehall sent me a private email recently, to which I responded, 
but didn't go through because, oh wonder of wonders, the pocketinet 
smtp server is listed on A spam list, and an apparent alias, 
white.pocketinet.com, is on two.

Now, aren't all these spam lists supposed to try and CONTACT the 
providers to get the issue resolved before blacklisting them? I know 
for a fact that if someone had actually contacted pocketinet about the 
problem customer that sent spam, they would have taken care of it 
promptly. It's a very small ISP in a remote area of Washington State, 
and it's run by friendly and competent people.
