For one application, which eats up all memory the 2.4 ENOMEM bahviour
works.

The scenario which made one of my boxes unusable under 2.4 is a forking
server, which gets out of control. The last fork gets ENOMEM and does
not happen, but the other forked processes are still there and consuming
memory. The server application does the correct thing. It receives
ENOMEM on fork() and cancels the connection request. On the next request
the game starts again. Somebody notices that the box is not repsonding
anymore and tries to login via ssh. Guess what happens. ssh login cannot
fork due to ENOMEM. The same will happen on 2.6 if we make it behave
like 2.4. 

We have TWO problems in oom handling:

1. When do we trigger the out of memory killer

As far as my test cases go, 2.6.10-rc2-mm3 does not longer trigger the
oom without reason.

2. Which process do we select to kill

The decision is screwed since the oom killer was introduced. Also the
reentrancy problem and some of the mechanisms in the out_of_memory
function have to be modified to make it work.
That's what my patch is addressing.

Sure, you can do so on your box, but can you accept, that we _CANNOT_
hard code a list of do not kill apps, except init, into the kernel. I
don't want to see the mail thread on LKML, where the list of precious
application is discussed.

Having a generic interface to make this configurable is the only way to
go. So users can decide what is important in their environment. There is
more than a desktop PC environment and a lot of embedded boxes need to
protect special applications.

No, it's not related to hyperthreading. It's on the way out. 

I put an additional check into the page allocator. Does this help ?
