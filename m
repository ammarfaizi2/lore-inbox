Looks like TUX caught MS's attention:
http://www.spec.org/osg/web99/results/res2000q4/web99-20001211-00082.html

Anyone know if their method of achieveing this is as flexible as TUX, or is
their "SWC 3.0" simply mean 'spec web cheat' and involve implimenting the
specweb dyanmic stuff in x86 assembly in their microkernel? :)
