Hi guys

I just wanted to test how well the 2.6.0 kernel would work for my PC, but i 
got 'stopped' by some problems. When i reboot with this 2.6 kernel the eth0 
interface got not recognized for some reason and comes up with messages like 

SIOCSIFADDR: No such device
eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
SIOCSIIFADDR: No such device
eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device
SIOCSIFNETMASK: No such device

I have a system with an Athlon 900 Mhz Thunderbird on an Asus KT133 Apollo 
mainboard with VIA chipset. Run 'Debian unstable'

The kernel got loaded OK (i think) 
see my lsmod and relevant dmesg output:

lsmod:

dmesg:
Linux version 2.6.0-test4 (root@borg) (gcc version 3.3.2 20030831 (Debian 
prerelease)) #1 Mon Sep 1 21:01:41 CEST 2003
...
Linux Tulip driver version 1.1.13 (May 11, 2002)
...

Also the PCI Ethernet card is recognized OK (I think because i don't see any 
difference between this output under version2.6.0test4 and 2.4.22:

lspci (2.6.0test4)
...
00:0a.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21041

...

lspci (2.4.22)
...
00:0a.0 Ethernet controller: Digital Equipment Corporation DECchip 21041 
[Tulip Pass 3] (rev 21)

Somehow the tulip.txt is also disappeared from the Documentation/networking/ 
tree.  

At last here is the .config file i used for building the new kernel:
