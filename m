About Mr. Ben Ho, former senior corporate executive

More than three years ago, just like many working-class executives I
enjoyed the prestige of serving in a multi-national corporation. I was
designated to take charge of a new setup in China. Many people would have
aspired to hold this high profile corporate job. I took up the challenge
and, just as anybody would, considered this an excellent career
opportunity. Even though I agreed with my brother-in-law who shared with me
many reasons why I should work something on the side, I could not find
time! I was engaged in building someone else's business. Not until I had
the opportunity to be exposed to the up-and-coming Chinese economy; did I
realise and experience the increasing economic threats of globalisation!
With increasing uncertainties in the 21st century, no jobs are for life! I
began to explore business opportunities for myself with a lot of
consideration. Finally, I took on this journey together with my beloved
wife. Today, I am glad that all our efforts have paid off.
