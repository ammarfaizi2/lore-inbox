Is it OK in your world that Aunt Tillie is dependent on a distro maker?  Is
it OK that she never gets to have a kernel compiled for anything above the
least-common-denominator chip?  

Not that I'm running down distro makers.  They do a valuable job, and in fact
my approach relies on Aunt Tillie's machine starting life with an all-modular
distro kernel.

But the point of this game is for Aunt Tillie to have more and better
choices.  Isn't that what we're supposed to be about?
