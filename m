Karl Marx and Ayn Rand would be contributing to this thread by now if
they weren't both indisposed ;-)

The concept of self-sacrifice for the good of the community (altruism)
was central to their ideas:  Marx thought altruism should be mandatory,
Rand thought it should be forbidden (because, in general, anything which
isn't forbidden is mandatory).

RMS is trying to thread a path between Marx and Rand, and naturally is
pissing off people on both sides.  Not an enviable lot in life, but at
least he picked it himself.
