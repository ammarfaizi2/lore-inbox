And why should I waste my disk space with BK docs?

When they are on website, they can be easily updated, and they don't waste
space/bandwidth for people that do not care. As BK only makes sense if you
have good connection to the Net, its more easily put on web page than other
docs (other docs is mostly usefull even for people without net).

So IMO bk docs should go to website somewhere.
