Well, merely shifting the FAQ from www.tux.org to vger.kernel.org
doesn't have any real benefit. The main thing is that the
www.kernel.org page has a link to the FAQ. If you want to have a
"local" mirrored copy that you link to instead (along with a link to
the official version at www.tux.org), I'm fine with that and can
update my push script. Just give me a place to write to.
