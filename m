Hi

This is a _hard_ lockup. No oops, no magic sysrq, no nuthin, just a
completely dead machine with only option the reset button. Usually happens
within a couple of minutes of desktop use but is 100% reproducible. Problem
is still there in a fresh checkout of current Linus git tree (post 2.6.18).

Dual Athlon-MP 2200's on a Tyan S2466 Tiger MPX. Config attached.

I used git-bisect and arrived at the apparent culprit below. Anything else I
should do to gather more info?

Help!

Thanks
Greg

commit 5d0cf410e94b1f1ff852c3f210d22cc6c5a27ffa
Author: john stultz <johnstul@us.ibm.com>
Date:   Mon Jun 26 00:25:12 2006 -0700

    [PATCH] Time: i386 Clocksource Drivers
    
    Implement the time sources for i386 (acpi_pm, cyclone, hpet, pit, and tsc).
    With this patch, the conversion of the i386 arch to the generic timekeeping
    code should be complete.
    
    The patch should be fairly straight forward, only adding the new clocksources.
