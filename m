I've looked everywhere but can't find any instruction on how to apply 
the -mm patches. I've tried "patch -p0 < 2.6.4-mm" and this seems to run 
without error, but the resulting source won't build. Can someone give me 
a quick example of how to apply the 2.6.4-mm patch to linux-2.6.4?

In answering this message, please CC me.

Thanks,
