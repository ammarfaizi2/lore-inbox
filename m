I happen to know of an orphaned wireless chip that might be revived  
if we can orchestrate orders for a few thousand cards.  It has a nice  
Linux driver that could be open sourced very easily, as so far as I  
can tell it doesn't derive from anything that wasn't BSD licensed in  
the first place... and the hardware performance is exemplary.  Anyone  
with significant purchasing capacity reading this?
