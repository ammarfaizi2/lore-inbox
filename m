I'm not sure we are specific targets: I have an "@free.fr" mail address 
too and using it gives me the same 550. Using a secondary mail address 
was ok. The whole "free.fr" domain might simply be rejected.

I don't know the reality behind this as I didn't get any reply from 
Andre (still battling with sis5513.c and my SIS735 to make them work 
together if anyone cares).

Lionel.

PS : In fact Daniela Engert cares and I thank her again for her time, 
but I don't expect anybody to be available 24/24, 7/7 for ugly code 
analysis (look at current sis5513.c) especially in these holyday times.
