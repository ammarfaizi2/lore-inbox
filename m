Just in case: this was directed towards Richard Stallman, and was meant
to convey the idea that free software of the future doesn't solve the
problem I have today.


Andre, your efforts, ideas and projects are much appreciated, and I've
seen them underestimated, and while I have often (in private, without
telling anyone, luckily) suspected they wouldn't work out that well,
they all proved me wrong and worked MUCH better than I expected.

Don't let your work get peed on by people who want you out of business
or who don't recognize your achievements.
