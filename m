That people didn't like the inclusion of firmware, I posted how you can
fix it by moving it outside of the kernel, and asked for patches.

None have come.

So I refuse to listen to talk about this, as obviously, no one cares
enough about this to actually fix the issue.

People drag this up about once a year, so you are just following the
trend...

This is my last reply to this thread, unless it contains code.
