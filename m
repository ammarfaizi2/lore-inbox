Dear List,

is there any location where there is more recent driver for the IBM MXT hardware
than on the IBM website (which hold patches for RedHat 7.2, kernel 2.4.9 or
so).  I know that SuSE includes the MXT driver with their kernel, but I'd like
to try it with 2.4.20...
(Or does the 2.4.9 whatever patch apply easily to any newer version - which I
doubt...)
Thanks for the help

Immanuel

P.S. What is the story w/ MXT and 2.5
P.P.S. Please don't blame me for asking - just have the hardware around and want
to try it out :-)
