The latest version is always available at http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/cml2/

Release 2.0.4: Tue Jan  8 22:55:43 EST 2002
	* Rulebase and help sync with 2.4.18-pre2/2.5.2-pre10.
	* kxref.py can report dependency/ancestry relationships and
	  label status now.
	* More autoconfigurator improvements, including --standalone option.

Bug queue is empty.  The compiler and interactive configurators are looking
stable at this point; most of my effeort is going into improving the
autoconfigurator.

A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance
accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give
orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem,
pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently,
die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
