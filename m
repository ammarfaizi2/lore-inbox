Who won't have drivers for Linux? Who told you that..?
It would be a start point if closed or not closed source but say never 
ever as your mail suggest is not a way to go.Whats about Servers that 
using NForce Based Chipsets and they need NCQ? Always saying not needed 
or so hard to hand out specs..is the lazy way that a company like NVidia 
shouldn't go.

Yes,you Nvidia decide..what's about the costumer dosn't the costumer 
option counts? It's the A and the O of costumer relationship.
Holding up a possiblity is better than say: "Oh, the costumers buy our 
hardware but have no right to use it at all."
So I paid 120€ for a NVidia Nforce4 and 3 Mainboard..and what..I can't 
use it correctly only in Windows?
NVidia seems only interesseted in GPU market so they hand out a bit of 
drivers...mh they are also closed source..so the argument you offered 
aboved is senseless...because NVidia do so for quite a long time.

So this was the last piece of NVidia I bought...about 400 Workstation 
..is not the worth.
