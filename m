The aggressive nature of the list is a result of people who have all spent a 
great deal of time researching kernel internals.  It is much akin to a thesis 
proposal and defense that you would see in an educational environment.  It 
may not be the most comfortable thing in the world, but it gets the base 
issues resolved, because if you do not know what is going on someone WILL 
tell you.  -- and then you revise and defend.   think of it as an academic 
discussion forum -- where people (usually) have the right to sound off.  
There is normally no harm done, although the recent MM discussions have been 
a bit heated.
