This patch implements an abstraction layer for external interrupt devices.
It creates a new sysfs class "extint" which provides a number of read-write
and a few read-only attributes which can be used to control a lower-level
hardware-specific external interrupt device driver.

The abstraction layer provides a mechanism to insulate applications from
the details of the capabilities and mechanisms of a particular external
interrupt device.  It also greatly simplifies low-level drivers.

+		  External Interrupt Abstraction Layer Driver
+		       Brent Casavant <bcasavan@sgi.com>
+
+Things you might ask yourself right away
+========================================
+
+What is an external interrupt?
+------------------------------
+
+Some types of applications, particuarly realtime process-control or
+simulations, need the ability to react to some simple external event.
+One way of doing this is special hardware that generates an interrupt
+whenever some external signal is applied to it.  A good example is
+the IO9 and IO10 cards on SGI Altix machines, which have an 1/8"
+stereo-style jack where a 0-5V signal can be fed into it.  Some
+outside piece of hardware can wiggle this line to cause the IOC4
+chip on these cards to generate an interrupt.
+
+Anything else to it?
+--------------------
+
+Besides being able to receive these interrupts, sometimes you'd like to
+generate similar signals for use by the outside world.  The abstraction
+layer also provides a signal output control mechanism.
+
+Why an abstraction layer?
+-------------------------
+
+Different chips might implement the external interrupt feature in
+very different ways, but in the end you just want to know when an
+interrupt occurs, perhaps have an ongoing count of these interrupts,
+and select the source of those interrupts.  An abstraction layer
+gives us this capability without needing to depend on specifics
+of the device being used.
+
+What an application or user cares about
+=======================================
+
+The external interrupt abstraction layer provides a character device,
+and several sysfs attributes to control operation.  Assuming the
+usual /sys mount-point for sysfs, these files are:
+
+	/sys/class/extint/extint#/dev
+				  mode
+				  modelist
+				  period
+				  provider
+				  quantum
+				  source
+				  sourcelist
+
+The "extint#" component of this path is determined by the extint driver
+itself, with the "#" replaced by a number (possibly multi-digit), one
+per external interrupt device beginning at zero.  There will be one of
+these dirctories per external interrupt device.
+
+The "dev" attribute contains the major and minor number of the abstracted
+external interrupt device.  If Linux's sysfs, hotplug, and udev are
+configured appropriately, udev will automatically create a /dev/extint#
+character special device file with this major and minor number.  If
+you prefer, you may manually invoke mknod(1) to create the character
+special device file.
+
+Once created, this device file provides a counter that can be used by
+applications in a variety of ways.  It can be memory mapped read-only
+as a single page, in which case the first unsigned long word of the
+page contains a counter that is incremented each time an interrupt
+occurs.  You can use poll(2) and select(2) for reading on a read-only
+file descriptor opened on the device, in which case the poll will
+indicate whether an interrupt has occurred since the last read(2)
+or open(2) of the file, and select will return when the next interrupt
+is received.  The file can also be the subject of read(2), in which
+case it returns an string representation of the value of the counter.
+
+The "source" attribute can be written to set the hardware source of
+interrupts (e.g. SGI's IOC4 chip can trigger either from the external
+pin, or an internal loopback from its interrupt output section).  It
+can be read to determine the current setting of the source.
+
+The "sourcelist" attribute can be read to determine the list of available
+interrupt sources, one per line.  These strings are the legal values
+which can be written to the "source" attribute.
+
+The "mode" attribute can be written to set the shape of the output
+signal for interrupt generation.  For example, SGI's IOC4 chip can
+set the output to a logic low, a logic high, strobe from low to high
+to low one time, set up a repeating strobe, or repeatedly toggle between
+high and low.  It can be read to determine the current setting of the
+mode.
+
+The "modelist" attribute can be read to determine the list of available
+output modes, one per line.  These strings are the legal values which
+can be written to the "mode" attribute.  (Note that at least in the
+case of the SGI IOC4 chip, there are other values which may be read
+from the "mode" attribute which don't appear in "modelist"; these
+represent invalid hardware states.  Only the modes present from
+the modelist are valid settings to be written to the mode attribute.)
+
+The "period" attribute can be written to set the repetition interval
+for periodic output signals (e.g. repeated strobes, automatic toggling).
+This period should be specified in nanoseconds, and should be written
+as a string.  It can be read to determine the current period setting.
+
+The "quantum" attribute can be read to determine the interval to which
+any writes of the "period" attribute will be rounded.  External
+interrupt output hardware may not support nanosecond granularity
+for output periods -- this attribute allows you to determine the
+supported granularity.  The behavior of the interrupt output when
+a value which is not a multiple of the quantum is written to the
+"period" attribute is determined by the specific low-level external
+interrupt driver, however generally the low-level driver should round
+to the nearest available quantum multiple.
+
+The "provider" attribute can be read to obtain an indication of which
+low-level hardware driver and device instance is attached to the
+external interrupt interface.  This string is free-form and determined
+by the low-level driver.  For example, the SGI IOC4 low-level driver
+will return a string of the form "ioc4_intout#".
+
+What a low-level external interrupt driver writer cares about
+=============================================================
+
+The interface to the abstraction layer driver is provided through
+the extint_properties and extint_device structures as defined in
+<linux/extint.h>, and the function prototypes contained therein.
+
+Driver registration
+-------------------
+To register the low-level driver with the abstraction layer, a
+call is made to:
+
+	struct extint_device*
+	extint_device_register(struct extint_properties *ep,
+			       void *devdata);
+
+The "ep" argument is a pointer to an extint_properties structure, which
+specifies the particular low-level driver functions the abstraction layer
+should call when reading/writing the attributes described in the previous
+section.  This is described below.
+
+The "devdata" argument is an opaque pointer which is stored by the
+extint code.  This value can be retrieved or modified via
+
+	void* extint_get_devdata(const struct extint_device *ed);
+	void extint_set_devdata(struct extint_device *ed, void* devdata);
+
+respectively.  This value can be used by the low-level driver to
+determine which of multiple devices it is operating upon, or whatever
+purpose may be desired.  This is described below.
+
+The return value is either a pointer to a struct extint_device (which
+should be saved for later interrupt notification and driver deregistration),
+or a negative error value in case of registration failure.  The driver
+should be prepared to deal with such failures.
+
+Implementation functions
+------------------------
+
+The struct extint_properties is as follows:
+
+struct extint_properties {
+	struct module *owner;
+	ssize_t (*get_mode)(struct extint_device *ed, char *buf);
+	ssize_t (*set_mode)(struct extint_device *ed, const char *buf,
+			    size_t count);
+	ssize_t (*get_modelist)(struct extint_device *ed, char *buf);
+	unsigned long (*get_period)(struct extint_device *ed);
+	ssize_t (*set_period)(struct extint_device *ed, unsigned long period);
+	ssize_t (*get_provider)(struct extint_device *ed, char *buf);
+	unsigned long (*get_quantum)(struct extint_device *ed);
+	ssize_t (*get_source)(struct extint_device *ed, char *buf);
+	ssize_t (*set_source)(struct extint_device *ed, const char *buf,
+			      size_t count);
+	ssize_t (*get_sourcelist)(struct extint_device *ed, char *buf);
+};
+
+(Note: Additional fields not of interest to the low-level external interrupt
+driver may be present -- drivers are encouraged to include linux/extint.h
+to acquire this structure definition.)
+
+"owner" should be set to the module which contains the functions
+pointed to by the remaining structure members.
+
+The remaining functions implement low-level aspects of the abstraction
+layer attributes.  They all take a pointer to the struct extint_device
+as was returned from the registration function.  In all of these functions,
+the value passed as the "devdata" argument to the registration function
+can be retrieved via:
+
+	extint_get_devdata(ed);
+
+And can be updated via:
+
+	extint_set_devdata(ed, newvalue);
+
+Typically this value is a pointer to driver-specific data for the
+individual device being operated upon.  It may, for example, contain
+pointers to mapped PCI regions where control registers reside.
+
+"get_mode" and "set_mode" implement the "mode" attribute of the abstraction
+layer.  "get_mode" should write the current mode into the single-page sized
+buffer passed as the second argument, and return the length of the written
+string.  "set_mode" should read the mode specified in the buffer passed as
+the second argument, and as sized by the third, and return the number of
+characters consumed (or a negative error number in event of failure).
+It should of course also cause the output mode to be set as requested.
+
+"get_modelist" implements the "modelist" attribute of the abstraction
+layer.  "get_modelist" should write strings representing the available
+interrupt output generation modes into the single-page sized buffer
+passed as the second argument, one mode per line.  It should return
+the number of bytes written into this buffer.
+
+"get_period" and "set_period" implement the "period" attribute of the
+abstraction layer.  "get_period" should return an unsigned long which
+represents the current repetition period in nanoseconds.  "set_period"
+should accept an unsigned long as the new value for the repetition
+period, specified in nanoseconds, and returning either 0 or a negative
+error number indicating a failure.  If the requested repetition period
+is not a value which can be exactly set into the underlying hardware,
+the driver is free to adjust the value as it sees fit, though tyipically
+it should round the value to the nearest available value.
+
+"get_provider" implements the "provider" attribute of the abstraction
+layer.  "get_provider" should write a human-readable string which
+identifies the low-level driver and a particular instance of a the
+driven hardware device.  For example, if the low-level driver provides
+its own additional device files for extra functionality not present
+in the abstraction layer, this routine might emit the name of the
+driver module and the names (or device numbers) of the low-level
+driver's own character special device files.
+
+"get_quantum" implements the "quantum" attribute of the abstraction
+layer.  "get_quantum" should return an unsigned long which represents
+the granularity to which the interrupt output repetition period can
+be set, in nanoseconds.
+
+"get_source" and "set_source" implement the "source" attribute of the
+abstraction layer.  "get_source" should write the current interrupt
+input source into the single-page sized buffer passed as the second
+argument, and return the length of the written string.  "set_source"
+should read the source specified in the buffer passed as the second
+argument, and as sized by the third, and return the number of characters
+consumed (or a negative error number in event of failure).   It should
+of course also cause the input source to be selected as requested.
+
+"get_sourcelist" implements the "sourcelist" attribute of the abstraction
+layer.  "get_sourcelist" should write strings representing the available
+interrupt input sources into the single-page sized buffer passed as the
+second argument, one source per line.  It should return the number of
+bytes written into this buffer.
+
+When an interrupt occurs
+------------------------
+
+When an external interrupt signal triggers an interrupt that is
+handled by the low-level driver, the driver should call:
+
+	void
+	extint_interrupt(struct extint_device *ed);
+
+This allows the abstraction layer to perform any appropriate
+abstracted actions (i.e. update the interrupt count, trigger
+poll/select actions, etc).  The sole argument is the struct
+extint_device which was returned from the registration call.
+
+Driver deregistration
+---------------------
+
+When the driver desires to unregister a particular device previously
+registered with the abstraction layer, it should call:
+
+	void
+	extint_device_unregister(struct extint_device *ed);
+
+The sole argument is the struct extint_device which was returned
+from the registration call.  There is no error return from this
+call, however if invalid data is passed to it the likelihood of
+a kernel panic is very high indeed.
+
+What a kernel-level external interrupt user cares about
+=======================================================
+
+In addition to the user-visible aspects of the external interrupt
+abstraction layer, there is a kernel-only interface available for
+interrupt notification.  This interface provides the ability for
+other kernel modules to register a callout to be invoked whenever
+an external interrupt is ingested for a particular device.
+
+Callout registration
+--------------------
+
+To register a callout to be invoked upon interrupt ingest, a
+struct extint_callout should be allocated, filled in, and
+passed to:
+
+	int
+	extint_callout_register(struct extint_device *ed,
+				struct extint_callout *ec);
+
+The first argument is the struct extint_device corresponding to
+the particular abstracted external interrupt hardware device of
+interest.  How exactly this structure is found is up to the
+caller, however the "file_to_extint_device" function will convert
+a struct file pointer to a struct extint_device pointer.  This
+function will return -EINVAL if an inappropriate file descriptor
+is passed to it.
+
+The second argument is one of the following structures:
+
+struct extint_callout {
+	struct module* owner;
+	void (*function)(void *);
+	void *data;
+};
+
+(Note: Additional fields not of interest to the external interrupt user
+may be present -- drivers are encouraged to include linux/extint.h
+to acquire this structure definition.)
+
+The "owner" field should be set to the module containing the function
+and data pointed to by the remaining fields.
+
+The "function" pointer is a callout function which is to be invoked
+whenever an interrupt is ingested by the abstraction layer for the
+device of interest.  It will be passed as its sole argument the
+"data" field, which is used opaquely and is provided solely for use
+by the caller.  That is, the abstraction layer will invoke:
+
+	ec->function(data);
+
+upon each interrupt of the specified device.
+
+Multiple callouts can be registered for the same abstracted external
+interrupt device.  They will be invoked in no guaranteed order, but
+will be invoked one at a time.
+
+The interrupt counter will be incremented before the callouts are
+invoked, but before any signal/poll notifications occur.
+
+The module specified by the "owner" field in the callout structure,
+as well as the module corresponding to the low-level external interrupt
+device driver, will have their reference counts increased by one until
+the callout is deregistered.
+
+Callout deregistration
+----------------------
+
+To remove a callout, simply call:
+
+	extern void
+	extint_callout_unregister(struct extint_device *ed,
+				  struct extint_callout *ec);
+
+With the same arguments as provided during callout registration.
+Both active and orphaned callouts can be removed in this manner
+with no distinction between the two.
+
+The callout function must continue to be able to be invoked
+until the call to extint_callout_unregister completes.
+
+Things you might ask yourself at the end
+========================================
+
+What if my hardware device supports a capability not in the abstraction?
+------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+There are two possibilities.  The first would be to add a new attribute
+to the abstraction, modify struct extint_properties to add appropriate
+interface routines, and update any existing drivers as necessary.
+
+The second, and generally preferable method, is for the the
+low-level driver to create its own device class and corresponding
+attributes and/or character special devices.  This is definitely
+the correct route to take if the capability is dependent on the
+hardware in a method that cannot be abstracted.
+
+A good example is the SGI IOC4's ability to map the interrupt output
+control register directly into a user application to avoid the kernel
+overhead of reading/writing the abstracted attribute files.  Using
+this capability means that the application must have intimate knowledge
+of the format of the control register -- something which both cannot
+be abstracted away by the kernel, and which is very specific to this
+particular IO controller chip.  This capability is provided by the
+ioc4_extint driver supplying its own character special device along
+with an ioc4_intout device class.
+
+Is there an example low-level driver to pattern mine after?
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+Sure.  linux/drivers/char/ioc4_extint.c
+
+Note that this low-level driver in addition to providing the
+abstraction interface, creates an IOC4-specific character
+special device and an IOC4-specific device class, as mentioned
+in the answer to the previous question.
+
+Why the callout mechanism?
+--------------------------
+
+For systems (not just applications, we're taking a higher-level view
+here) which are critically interested in responding as quickly as
+possible to an externally triggered event, waiting for a poll/select
+operation, or even busy-waiting on the value of the interrupt counter
+to change may not provide appropriate response times or have other
+deleterious effects (i.e. tieing up a CPU spinning on a value).  This
+gives the system architecht a tool to gain minimal-latency notification
+of events, and react accordingly, by writing their own kernel module.
+
+It also provides an extension capability that might be of interest
+in certain scenarios.  For example, there could be an application
+that wants a interrupt counter page much as maintained by the
+abstraction layer, but which starts counting at zero when the
+device special file is opened.  Or, there could be an application
+which wants a signal to be generated and delivered to the process
+when an interrupt is ingested.  These examples are more esoteric
+than the simple counter page, and are best provided by a seperate
+module rather than cluttering the main external interrupt abstraction
+code.
+
+Why wasn't this made compatible with IRIX's ei(7) driver from an
+application perspective?
+----------------------------------------------------------------
+
+IRIX's driver uses ioctl(2) calls to interact with user space.  This
+is frowned upon in Linux, and generally doesn't perform very well on
+Linux due to kernel locking issues.
+
+One advantage gained by this mechanism is control methods which are
+easily utilized from the command-line, rather than requiring specially
+written and compiled applications to function the device.
