I am a Senior Manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of Fortune Bank Plc. Some years ago, I was an account officer to a foreigner/contractor to the Federal Government, late Engr. Michael Frank who died in a car crash years ago.

I am privilegded to know that he left in his domiciliary account untill his death the sum of $23.5M (Twenty Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand  US Dollars) which is yet to be claimed. The banking policy and financial  law of my bank upholds that all unclaimed funds within eight (8) years   be declaerd unclaimable and then be sent into the treasury as  unclaimed bills.

My bank had expected any of his (foreign) relative or next of kin to claim the fund since the account has remained unclaimed over the years but all have proved to no avail. It is the impossibility of any of Engr. Michael Frank's next of kin  coming for the claim (he had no wife and child according to his record)  that I write this proposal to you to have your permission so that you can stand in as his next of kin and the fund will be subsequently transfered into your account for further disbursement. 

I am ready to give you 30% of the total while I do also wish to commit a larger part of my share into any viable investment in your country with you assiting me. 
	
Reach me immiediately, furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. As soon as I receive your response, I will make a draft of the application that you will need to send for the claim.

I expect your urgent response.

Best Regards,
Paul Ogor
