FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS

1. Activation key does not work. 
(a) The activation system in Spyware Stormer is case sensenitive. This means
that both the order number and the activation key must be entered in the
same case in which they were provided (eg. abcd = lowercase) (eg. ABCD =
uppercase). 
(b) If you accidentally include any spaces before or after the order number
or activation key, the program will not accept the values entered. 
(c) "Zeros" Os and "Ohs" 0s are commonly interchanged for one another. If an
O ("Oh")is entered in place of a 0 (Zero), then the key will not work.
Please ensure that "Zeros" 0s and "Ohs" Os are entered correctly. 

To avoid the above problems, simply copy the key/order number to your
computer's clipboard (CTRL + C) and then paste the key/order number into the
appropriate field (CTRL + V).

2. Activation key is lost. 
If you have lost your activation key or order number, please reference the
email in your inbox with the subject "ClickBank Receipt - automated
notification." The email sender will appear as receipt@clickbank.com. In the
body of the email you will find a link that, when clicked, returns you to
the confirmation page on the Spyware Stormer website where you can retrieve
your activation key and order number.

Look for this text in the body of the email "If for some reason you did not
receive access to the product immediately after payment, please try again by
following this link now:"

3. Can't register the product. 
To register Spyware Stormer, you must return to the application and enter
your order number and activation key. Begin by clicking "Start" on your
computer's taskbar, then go to "Programs" and locate the "Spyware Stormer"
folder. Then click the "Spyware Stormer" icon to open the application. Once
the application loads, click the "Register" button located in the top-right
corner of the application. Then, fill in your order number and activation key
exactly as they appear on the confirmation page you were sent to after
making your purchase.

4. Infections are not being fully removed. 
If you have scanned your computer for infections, removed them, and they are
still appearing, this may be due to the following: If there are any Internet
Explorer windows open while you perform the scanning and removing functions,
some infections may attach themselves to the program, which prevents them
from being removed. To remove these infections, you must ensure that all
Internet Explorer windows are closed while performing the scanning and
removing functions. If infections continue to appear after removal, please
try rebooting your computer and running a new scan immediately after
boot-up, before any other applications are started, and preferably while you
are off-line.

5. Can't open Spyware Stormer. 
To open Spyware Stormer, click "Start" on your computer's taskbar, then
"Programs" and locate the "Spyware Stormer" folder. Then click the "Spyware
Stormer" icon to open the application.


Thank you,
