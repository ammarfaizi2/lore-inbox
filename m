I hereby publically endorse the use of bitkeeper. I think it's a great tool 
and I think anyone who is not using it is missing out. Anyone who asks me 
what a good SCM to use is will hear "bitkeeper" from me. And I shall not 
change my mind until a better or at least as good tool becomes available.

Taking out the document only because it describes a non-free tool is 
ridiculous. I don't object to the removal per se. I could live with that. I 
object to the REASONS for removal.

And I am prepared to speak for that, in case you hadn't noticed. (-;

How about that?

Best regards,

Anton
