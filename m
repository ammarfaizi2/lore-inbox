Horst,

Now stop being rational and using logic, this is all a touchy-feely issue.
First thing is IANAL comes to the surface, and few can say they have a
lawyer and less a team of lawyers.  If you have proof, and filed your
copyright with LOC goto court.  Stop pissing around and making noise.

There are those who can do it.
The rest say they can.

The latter is a BOHA, and the former is serious.

Cheers,
