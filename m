Given Nvidia still only provides mangled basically binary graphics drivers
Im not stunningly hopeful. Maybe nvidia will prove me wrong but I suspect 
Linux on such a device won't support the audio, won't support the graphics
in full and might only get you basic PIO IDE and no AGP

It does look an interesting chipset. It would be very nice to get it supported
as well as they other embedded chipsets like the i815.
