If you wish to be taken seriously, perhaps you might not want to use insults when 
you are obviously trying to act as SCO's representative.

How much are they paying you?

God knows, I wouldn't be a self-righteous, obnoxious prick at another's behalf 
unless I was paid for it.  Lawyers are much better at both being a prick and 
documenting their case - and SCO has more than enough (lawyers, that is) to go around.

But, I can be rude and insulting, since I am not trying to be taken seriously.
