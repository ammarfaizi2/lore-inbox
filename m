Please don't think or imply I'd plan to do this, I'm only saying that 
there's a risk for users in such grey areas.

It could be that someone who wants to harm Linux starts suing people 
distributing Linux. If your goal is to harm Linux, suing users can 
simply be much more effective than suing vendors...

It could even be that people distributing Linux could receive cease and 
desist letters from people without any real interest in the issue
itself - "cease and desist letter"s are so frequent in Germany because 
the people who have to sign them have to pay the lawyers' costs that are 
usually > 1000 Euro, and that's a good business for the lawyers.
