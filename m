Larry, please.

SunOS _is_ dead [1]. Ever since they switched to Solaris, you seem to
be sore about Si^hun and everything that comes out of them [3] :-)

If it wasn't for Java, 99% of the commercial world today would be
Visual Basic. So, please, stop bashing on it just because you're not
using it.

All operating systems suck. All languages suck. Everyone can write bad
code in every language. It's neither a question of a language or OS
but of developer skill and experience.

Just the fact that some people use Java (or any other language) does
not mean, that they don't care about "performance, system-design or
any elegance whatsoever" [2].

[1] I still have a SunOS 4.1.4_patched_to_the_hell_and_back box at a
customer site and this single box gives us more headaches performance-
, stability and security wise than any of the 10+ Solaris 2.7 or 25+
Linux boxes. It's a sucker to keep the newbie admins awake, that there
were things before bash, linuxconf and /sbin/chkconfig. Compiling an
OpenSSH on this box made at least one of the newbies quit. =;-)

[2] I was raised on SunOS 4.0.3 and I'm glad to have Solaris+Linux. I
did an OS innards course at the university around 1991/1992 and they
had a license to give the students a look into the source code of
SunOS at this time. I had nightmares for weeks after. Horrors after
horrors to sacrifice "system-design and elegance" for "performance".

[3] Please. It starts sounding like the nostalgia some east germans
develop to get their totalitarian regime back, because "everything was
better then".
