A little of both, but not too much of either.

I'd say "New to linux" but I've been using it on and off since 1995 or

I'd say terribly presumptuous, but I don't think it is presumptuous to
say that if there are many patches (bug fixes, mostly) coming in that
the code that was originally there was of questionable quality.
