Great, glad you understand that you are crossing the legal line.

What a pile of nonsense.  Let's translate this to reality.  You can't
figure out how to build the right answer and you have decided you need
access to internal information created by BitKeeper to reverse engineer
BitKeeper and you are complaining because we don't feel obligated to
give you that.

If you think you can create a better answer on your own, by all means,
do so, nobody is stopping you.  But whining that you aren't being helped
by the people who have figured it out is not exactly inspiring.  I can
assure you that I am not inspired to help you and I'm disgusted that yet
again an you have taken something that we are trying to do to help people
and turned it into a whine fest for your personal agenda.
