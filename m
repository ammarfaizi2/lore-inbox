Is there a list somewhere(with ability to download) of all of the
patches to 2.4.20 that people have applied or suggested?

I don't want to move my production system to 2.4.21-preX but I do want
to make sure I've kept 2.4.20 up-to-date.

Or is the answer, just wait for 2.4.21?

Thanks Alot!
Brent Clements
