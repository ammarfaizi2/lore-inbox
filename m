Hello,

I am aware of work being done to create crypto patches for 2.4 however I
am wondering what kind of time scale is likely to be involved before a
patch for 2.4.0 becomes available and, more importantly, when such a
patch will be suitable for daily use (disclaimers withstanding
obviously).

Let's just say I'm cautious after a bad experience with one of the
previous dud patch releases :P

Thanks,
	Jonathan.

P.S. Congrats to everyone involved with 2.4 - I guess the
"vapourwareists" finally got what they wanted.
