My Asus A7V (not 133, not 266) is fine with Red Hat 7.1, but it only supports
B-type (100/200 MHz FSB) Athlons. I haven't yet tested it with kernels newer
than what Red Hat provides, though.

I'm not having any that aren't being caused by my hard drives right now.

Certainly not. I've seen benchmarks where an Athlon 1.4 beats the stuffing out
of a P4 1.8. I realize its just a benchmark, but when it happens in about 70%
of the benchmarks (oriented at different subsytstems) it HAS to be more than
just coincedence.

And have you seen the price difference lately? Even if the Athlon was slower,
it's still a lot cheaper.
