Hi,

        The diff file generated by comparing ext3/ and
kernel/fs/checkfs/ can also be accessed from the link
http://checkfs.linsyssoft.com/temp/
        I cleaned it, but still it has some unnecessary differences. I
am working on that to make it more clean and will send it to u as soon
as I finish with that.
