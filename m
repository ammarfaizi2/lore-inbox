Hello

For a system administration lesson, I have to do a presentation about the 
linux kernel scheduler. I would like to present the difference between the 
scheduler of the 2.4.X and th 2.6.X, but start the analyse from sources will a 
little bit difficult, I try to find information on google, but I've found 
nothing that explain really how the scheduler work, Only general information 
about scheduler. Is there any document or book where I can find this kind of 
information ?

thanks for your help and merry Christmas
Yoann
