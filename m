The problem with the present type of donation systems is knowing your
donation is not going to be abused.

I though a model that may work is a United Way type of model ... have a
central non-profit act as a clearing house for donations to specific
open source projects.  The non-profit would do the proper account
reporting of receipts, overhead, and funding to the various open source
projects (an effort to keep donation abuse down and allow open non-bias
account reporting).  Allowing either a general donation or target
donation from the public to a particular project.  Then a specific
project would register with the non-profit to receive funding help.  In
order to qualify you would need to provide certain technical/financial
reporting of your project to the non-profit to demonstrate you need the
financial help and you are working on a needed project.

The real problem is getting something like this started.
