Hello,

before I go on, let me say that I did check the FAQ. I also checked
the available archives, but curiously did not find an answer to my
question (so I did Read The Fantastic Manual).

As you know, most available drivers do come with the source code. But,
still, some come in binary form (often providing just enough code to
make them compliant with new kernel releases).

Is this a GPL violation ? In any case, what is the official position
on the subject (is this legal or just tolerated) ?

Thank you

Emmanuel
