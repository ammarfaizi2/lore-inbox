Suppose I have scripts to automate kernel building in that dir?

Or even worse, suppose $KBUILD_OBJTREE gets reset to some weird
value by accident and my whole home dir goes bye bye upon make
mrproper?

Suppose many other scenarios, this "feature" can't stand -- it's inconceivable
that you'd just do "rm -rf $KBUILD_OBJTREE". And I can't see why you would even
try, given you "know" the names of the files generated anyway.
