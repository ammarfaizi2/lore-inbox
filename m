I don't really want to get into it at the moment, but imagine hacking
netfilter without lugging a laptop around. PDA's are sleek and cool,
and using UNIX on them lets you write shell scripts to sort your
addresses and stuff like that. Basically it's everything that's cool
about Unix as a workstation OS scaled down to PDA-size.
