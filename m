Hi volks!

After beeing on holiday and having a lot of work the last few weeks I had time 
to try compile 2.5.33 on my AS1000 (Noritake system).

It compiled successfull. I have not yet tried to reboot the machine because it 
is used currently...

I will try later and tell you if it works or not...

Thanks a lot to all those alpha developers who made this possible. I guess 
Ivan was one of the most involved people. :o)

Best regards!
