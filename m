hmm well after doing some research at google.com ( groups and web )
i figured out, the WLAN card i bought. has this TI ACX100 chipset.
and there ain't no driver. afaik. Also someone said, that Dlink was
doing some linux driver. I'm suspicious this will happen anyway. 
Since a mail i sent Dlink support. The US Support pointed me to
the Driver for the DWL 520 and 650 which have the Prism2 chip and 
though linux-wlan does support the. Dlink DE support told me they
didn't know about any driver but would inform me if they do.

so it looks to me as if i'm on my own. well i don't mind... :*/
(*grmbl*)
I wonderd if ReverseEngineering the Windows Driver might help me with
that. though my ASM knowledge ain't taht good (but that is increaseable)
and in Germany afaik. Rev.Eng. is allowed.

So why i write it to this ML. is because, this is kinda the 'source'
when talking about driver, i guess. And well might be you know of anyone
doing allreaday that... So i just don't start doing obsolet stuff.

regards
