I'd really like to see those. Because right now some parts of the
discussion seem to contradict eachother (sometimes subtle so it's hard
to point the finger at it and ask, sometimes glaringly obvious), and I
thought you both worked on the same project. ;-)

That makes it kind-of-hard to understand where you're coming from and
where you're headed. I know that people even on the same project have
different opinions, but before a review, let's have a barrier and
distributed synchronization, ok? ;-)
