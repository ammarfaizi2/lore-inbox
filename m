Ever notice Linus has a very distinct writing style? _under_scores_ 
and: colons. (Underscored colons sound ouchy!)
			Signatures
after three tabs...

He has very clear and logic oriented writing style, yet unique somehow.
You can almost here him talk when you read a _Linus_ message.

There's only one Linus: Let's keep it that way! Let's sign him with gpg
and take measures so that he _only_ operates in _good_ mode on DRM
enabled LKML.
