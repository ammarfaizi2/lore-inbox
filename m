Yeah, because you used 

#if defined __BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD

and

#if defined __LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD

which relies on the fact that it -seems- that by luck, gcc only has two
representations around and they match little/big endian archs (though
have we verified that is always correct, especially between 32 and 64
bits archs ?)

It's still wrong to do.

Cheers,
Ben.
