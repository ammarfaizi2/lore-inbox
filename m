Many of you may know Linux kernel developer Leonard Zubkoff (BusLogic
and DAC960 maintainer, among other contributions).  Leonard was killed
recently in a helicopter crash.  See
http://www.ktva.com/Stories/0,1413,163%257E6883%257E834332,00.html.
Leonard was one of the smartest people that I know, and I consider
myself lucky enough to have been privileged to work with him.  He will
be missed.
