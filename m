Sure, it would be terrible, if we started to accept "crap", but I wouldn't 
consider content that is worth its "salt", like reiserfs4, to be "crap".

Rejection of content should be based on technical merits only, and no process 
guidelines should stay in the way of its preliminary acceptance.  Otherwise, 
we would be asking for a return to a bureaucratic system that inhibits 
innovation, which I'm sure is not the intention of anybody, I hope.

BTW, this does not mean that impoliteness should be rewarded, on the 
contrary, impoliteness has no place anywhere, and should just be ignored, 
even if the content is worth its salt.

Thanks!
