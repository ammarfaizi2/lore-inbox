IMHO crypto/ should only contain things that are actually part of the
crypto layer: API code and crypto_alg implementations.

We have precedents for this.  We have the crypto_alg implementation of
sha1 in crypto, but the actual algorithm lives in lib.  Ditto for crc
and zlib.

In this case, the MPI library is even further away from the crypto layer
than any of these cases since it is not a crypto algorithm by itself.
In fact, we can't be sure that there won't ever be another part of the
kernel that requires direct access to the MPI library without going
through the crypto layer.

Cheers,
