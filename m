Hello, this is Brad again,
are you ready to make the only step necessary to ensure your financial
dreams become a reality? No time to enjoy the sweeter things in life? Your
family perhaps? Your friends? A vacation? Tired of shift work? Allow me to
guide you to freedom! 
After shortest time I am now averaging twelvethousand USdollars monthly and
am personally coaching each entrepreneur in our team.
Email me at:     Freedom1000@mighty.co.za
and put "FREEDOM Info" in the sub-ject.

You won't regret it.


To re-move yourself, just email to  offlist@mighty.co.za  with "re-move" in
the sub-ject. 

Sincerely, 
Brad  c/o Thornton-Group
