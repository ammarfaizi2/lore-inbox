It is not "more secure". It solves completely different problem.

Yes. It also means that key is gone after resume.

Solution above does not require passphrase (so users will actually use
it) and dmcrypt with passphrase does not destroy the key after resume,
so data can still be recovered.

They are orthogonal. You want both.

If something is still unclear, we can talk on irc somewhere, if you
agree to write FAQ entry afterwards ;-).
