Happens on my thinkpad r-30, 2.5.31, latest bitkeeper. Preempt is
enabled, uni processor.=20

The boot gets past the hard disk detection code and then dies with a
kernel BUG at sched.c:944 (schedule in interrupt).=20

The process is swapper (pid 0) and there's no oops left in syslog. I
could copy it by hand from the screen if it's useful - it's
reproducable, happens on every boot.=20

Will be happy to debug it further.=20
