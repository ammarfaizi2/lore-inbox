_I_ think it's childish to claim the above. You _may_ have a choice, yes, but 
is that choice equal or fair? Microsoft has infected both the user area as 
much as the business/work area. If you want to purchase a PC because your 
computer just fried and you want to finish a paper or something, but you 
_want_ to use KOffice on Linux, and you don't care for Windows/Word 
whatsoever, what are the chances that if you run down to the computer store 
your "choices" will be Windows/Word, _period_! You'll then have to make sure 
that none of the hardware in it is Software driven-like winmodems-and that 
it's supported by Linux (or whatever OS you prefer). Almost all computers out 
there (from well-known compianies) ship with winmodems. How is that a choice? 
You have a choice to waste $70 on a harware modem, when someone who uses 
Windows doesn't?

Then, when it comes to work, what are you choices there? You choose not to 
Work for one of the Windows-based companies out there, and spend more time 
looking for a different job, but at the same time you choose not to pay your 
rent, feed your kids, etc. All I'm asking for is a _fair_ choice! Even if 
one's lucky enough to get their preffered non-MS job, they will have to work 
for some MS company while they scout around for it. So yes, we have a choice, 
but going the MS way is the muuuuch easier route. And this is all owed to the 
fact that MS is driving special campaigns instilling fear in the hearts of 
non-MS companies, offering "great deals on software packages", "solving your 
problems the right way", making you feel that if you don't go MS you're 
screwed, etc. You never see SUN, do that, do you?

So what I call a choice is a fare choice. And I don't see one here.
