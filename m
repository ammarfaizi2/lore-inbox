You're right, it is a pain.  I need to pull each patch down, go back to
your original email, cut-n-paste the changlog, etc.  For patches-via-email
I have all that scripted, or course.  Plus nobody will bother reading the
patches.  

I would have done it anyway, but half the URLs you provided go 404.

It's broken.  So is mozilla mailnews.

Attachments should be OK.  One patch per email, with a good title and the
changelog text in the email body.  Nice and easy.

Thanks.
