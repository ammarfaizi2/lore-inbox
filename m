Just my 2c,

but is it a fault in AMDs chip or a fault in a
mother board/agp version/chipset ??

There seems to be a number of people who have no problems on various video 
cards and a number of people who have problems with various video cards, etc, 
etc. Which is kinda leading me to go 'huh' and look puzzled because it is not 
constant. This is why I thought there must by something else common to the 
h/w of the people who are having problems.

if nothing comes out from Daniel:

maybe a look into these other areas is in order?

cheers
