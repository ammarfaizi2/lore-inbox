I'm just a bit dubious about adding new signals since they are hardcoded 
in the kernel. It's a time consuming process to add new signals (either 
for development build or for official kernels). This is one of the 
reasons I liked more about the original kevent patch. Wouldn't simple 
#defines have been enough for signal names?

I thought quite a bit about to where add my kobjects. I couldn't find a 
/sys/net on my current system (am I missing some config option?). If you 
mean /sys/class/net aren't all kobject in there supposed to be of same 
type (namely class_device associated with net_device). Of course I could 
add them under some interface, but then again my iptables rules would 
have to be interface specific and this is the thing I'm trying to avoid 
in this approach. Adding to /sys would be an overkill as it'd require 
implementing a subsystem. And I couldn't find any other suitable place 
so ended up making a new class.

I actually made some test code to add a new class and it's relatively 
simple. But I guess it isn't really useful if I'd be the only user. 
Maybe it could have some features that'd make it more generic?

Of course, I could use the "connector" patch that Greg pointed, but I'd 
still like more the kevent approach. Namely, it'd make my userland app 
much simpler.

Cheers,
   Timo
