I don't know if anyone can say if it's stable, as there are no dual Athlon
boxes out there yet.

AFAIK Tyan is the only manufacturer building such a board (Thunder K7 /
S2562) right now. This will use AMD's 760MP Chipset with DDR memory support
up to 4GB, 5 64bit PCI slots, AGP pro, dual NIC (3c920), U160SCSI (aic7899).
The launch for dual Athlon is planned for June 4th.
If this will be rock-solid will be shown in the first weeks of Q3.
 
I am also highly interested in information about dual Athlon (which
kernel/compiler/tools to use?), as we will get a dual Athlon sample before
the launch.

Olli
