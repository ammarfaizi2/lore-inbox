Due to the silence of him, we must assume that he has given up. CML2 has
a few problems, which make it unlikely that it gets included as is.
Anyway, not all hope is lost, I started my own configuration system some
time ago, which will be less complex than CML2. It's only advancing a bit
slowly currently, as I only have little time to work on it.

bye, Roman
