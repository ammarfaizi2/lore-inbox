I recently purchased:

http://www.mitsumi.com/products/FA404.htm

I've enabled everything needed...the CF port works flawlessly. However,
the SD slot does *not*. I've got about 5+ pages worth of dmesg output
related to this (MMC is NOT debug enabled, and I still get a disturbing
amount of output). Would here be the best place to post this, or would a
different list be better? (Recommendations as to which list are welcomed
:)).
