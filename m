I purchased a ZyXEL router, and noted in its log:

0day 00:00:16 klogd started: BusyBox v1.00-pre8 (2005.06.02-02:19+0000)
0day 00:00:16 Linux version 2.4.18-MIPS-01.00 (root@UTOPIA) (gcc version
3.3.3) #53 Fri Jun 10 16:13:48 CST 2005
...

I contacted the vendor to request source, since no mention of it is made
on their website (http://www.zyxel.com), or documentation:

---
Subject: Linux GPL software for P-330W  
                
Where can I obtain the Linux software for the P-330W, as required under
Gnu Public Licence (Firmware Version: v4.2.1.6.6e.)?

Their response:

---
Sir, 
Our unit is only based on Linux. It is not necessarily built off the
source code. The code was developed by our engineers in Taiwan.  As this
is the case, we do not have access to the code here, and it is not
covered by the GPL. If you need more assistance, please call at
1-800-255-4101. 

Thank you,

The response seems meaningless; does this constitute a violation of GPL?
If so what, if any, action needs to be taken?
