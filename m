Correct.  You do not have to give your software for free.  (In
European patent terminology it is not called technology, by the way).

Correct.  You have the right to say "no way unless you agree not to
reverse engineer".

Someone may copy and use your software _without_ agreeing to the license.

Then you can sue them for breach of copyright.

You will win, unless their copying was fair use.

Reverse engineering for interoperability is a form of fair use in many
countries, including Germany and the UK.

Draw your own conclusion :)
