Ok, test10-final is out there now. This has no _known_ bugs that I
consider show-stoppers, for what it's worth.

And when I don't know of a bug, it doesn't exist. Let us rejoice. In
traditional kernel naming tradition, this kernel hereby gets anointed as
one of the "greased weasel" kernel series, one of the final steps in a
stable release.

We're still waiting for the Vatican to officially canonize this kernel,
but trust me, that's only a matter of time. It's a little known fact, but
the Pope likes penguins too.
