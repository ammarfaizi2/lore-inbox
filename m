Depends how you view it - I'd much rather host my mailing lists on a
server that I knew scans for virii and deals with any it finds than
one that doesn't.

McAfee isn't a guarantee, no more than any other virii scanner is. I
used to use McAfee, and had it in auto-update mode. I still got hit by
FOURTEEN virii within half an hour of it updating itself!

Even if you're careful, you can still get hit, so don't rest on your
laurels...

My own viewpoint is somewhat less blase than yours - the more virii
scanners between the originator and me, the lower the likelihood of my
systems getting a virii.

Perhaps you'd care to give details, since you're so blase about it...

Oh?

 > Some PEOPLE are ignorant or unreliable...

Whether people are ignorant or unreliable has about as much to do with
whether their computers can catch virii as with whether they can. The
only people likely to claim otherwise are virii writers, IMHO.

The basic point of this duscussion is that the email system's
instructions are flawed and need changing.

Best wishes from Riley.
