I was, twice, and it did suffice. Try it:

"needed for revenue generation"
"required to meet customer needs"

Don't be taking away the ammo.

When the argument doesn't work, your organization

Politics are getting in the way. It's OK though,
since that just puts you at a market disadvantage.
Soon enough, the competiter will be hiring.
