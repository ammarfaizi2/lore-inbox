It's absolutely correct for IPComp.  For other uses it may or may not
be correct.

For instance for JFFS2 it's absolutely incorrect since it breaks
compatibility.  Incidentally, JFFS should create a new compression
type that doesn't include the zlib header so that we don't need the
head-skipping speed hack.

Can you please point me to the paragraph in RFC 1950 that says this?

Not really.  However it should be possible if the user needs it which
is why we should make windowBits configurable.

Yes, I'd love to see a patch that makes windowBits configurable in
crypto/deflate.c.
