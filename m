No devfs here. Looking closer at my devices,

/dev/cdrom  => /dev/scd0
/dev/cdrom1 => /dev/hdc
/dev/cdrom2 => /dev/scd1

cdrom1 and cdrom2 are bogus and I believe were generated by the Red Hat 7.3 
upgrade (before I had 7.1) probably on account of the screwy cdrom duplication 
I reported.

Cheers,


Chris.
