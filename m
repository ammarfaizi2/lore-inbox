I personally started using Linux in March of 1992 -- Version 0.94 IIRC.
Linux 2.0 was out by 1996 was it not?  I stand by my 'well established'
comment above.

You developed tools and packages that you intended to put into a system
that you have called the Hurd.  While you were developing all of the various
pieces for that system (Hurd) other people were using those packages on
various other systems -- I used gcc under SunOS and Dynix long before I'd
head of Linux.. And I used more GNU packages than vendor packages on most
of the HP-UX boxes I administrated after college.. You have said in the past
that that doesn't make those GNU/HP-UX Boxes... 

That the various packages and tools developed to support your project
(Hurd) were used by another project developing a seperate operating system
does not give you the right to name that seperate operating system.  Those
people who put together all the various pieces and made it work call it Linux.

I'm going to agree with Larry here.  If you're going to insist that people
call it GNU/Linux, then you had better start referring to your operating
system as Linux/Hurd if you want to retain any credibility.

People get angry because you're being disrespectful and presumptuous to
try and tell people who know exactly what the order of events are that
you and your foundation were actively involved in developing Linux.  That
was not the case and you know it.

Before this whole naming fiasco started, I was a strong supporter of GNU
software.  I am not any longer because of *your* actions, Richard.  I am
still and plan to remain a strong supporter of free software.. but I don't
feel affiliated with the FSF any more.  And that's a pity.
