I think you were going to change this line, which fixed the jumps in the
irq distribution:

--- io_apic.c	2005-08-11 10:14:33.564748923 -0700
+++ io_apic.c.new	2005-08-11 10:15:55.412331115 -0700
@@ -617,7 +617,7 @@ int gsi_irq_sharing(int gsi)
  	 * than PCI.
  	 */
  	for (i = 0; i < NR_IRQS; i++)
 -		if (IO_APIC_VECTOR(i) == vector) {
 +		if (IO_APIC_VECTOR(i) == vector && i != gsi) {
  			if (!platform_legacy_irq(i))
  				break;			/* got one */
  			IO_APIC_VECTOR(gsi) = 0;
But it's not in this version of the patch.
