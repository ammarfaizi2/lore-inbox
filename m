Check out the Compaq iPaq 3600 series.

Ehm, I know that people actually use their iPaq to compile things
natively. Plug in an IBM microdrive, add a foldable keyboard and you
get a complete Unix workstation in pocket format. For more information,
see http://www.handhelds.org/ .

[who also natively compiles kernels on a platform comparable to the
iPaq -- see http://www.lart.tudelft.nl/ ]
