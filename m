For the benefit of those of you who, like me, didn't know what a
dunnart is, from http://library.thinkquest.org/28994/dunnart.html:

    There are ten species of dunnart. Some of them are the common
    dunnart, white-footed dunnart, and the Darling Downs
    dunnart. There is also the fat-tailed dunnart. They are called the
    marsupial mouse and are usually 10 to 16 cm. long.

    They live in Australia and New Guinea. These marsupial mice live
    in deserts and rainforests and eat grasshopppers, spiders,
    lizards, mice and small animals.

    All dunnarts are fearless and will protect themselves if they are
    scared or threatened. They all have litters of up to 10 babies
    about 3 to 4 times a year.

    The fat-tailed dunnart is the smallest and has soft, fine, gray or
    black fur. They also have large ears and thick tails with short,
    stiff hairs. The dunnart stores all its fat in its tail.

According to that third paragraph, we need to up our release schedule
a bit.
