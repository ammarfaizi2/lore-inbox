Subject: 6x11 font in iso-8859-2 version?

Hi!

Who is author of drivers/video/font_6x11.c? I'd like to get that font
in iso-8859-2 version, but don't know where to look... [Getting
national charset on my handheld would be great.]

What is charset of fonts in kernel, btw? It does not seem to be
specified. Or is it different for each font?
