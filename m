I had been hoping someone had just forged your email
address. :-/

The wordy mix-case aspect is kind of annoying, and for
all that we don't get to differentiate actions.
I count:

1. came up with the design ideas
2. wrote the original patch
3. reviewed and passed on
4. modified
5. blindly passed on

Maybe "blindly passed on" needs nothing. So I'm
thinking, if we must bother with all this...

Add "pirated:" if you like, so that searching for
pirated code is easier than checking the evil bit.
