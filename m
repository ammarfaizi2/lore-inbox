I read a review of these and put one on my system when I built the new
one.  However, I am wondering if this is the problem with my system
mentioned in the above thread.  I don't believe I damaged anything
putting it on and I don't believe it is shorting anything out.

As best as I can tell, the memory is NOT overheating.

I DO NOT OVERCLOCK.  I just put it on as a precaution.  (I hate having
hardware die because of heat.)

Anyway, does anyone know if this is bad or good or just garbage?

Trever
