LVM concerns us all now that it is not just an addon, but actually a
part of the kernel. Rejecting mails and reports from users and
developers who just might be able to lend you a hand fixing bugs, is not
just counter productive it's downright rude!

Besides, I didn't think the posting was flame material at all. If
nothing else, it's a wake up call.
