	Actually...the above incident had nothing (to my knowledge)
to do with SGI politics but with Linux 'community' politics. However,
politics and Machiavelli have never been my forte (I tend to be too
straightforward/open), so in agreement with Mr. Schaufler, below, 
what would I know regarding such?

In the same spirit, just a gentle reminder, Mr. Schaufler is a manager
at a commercial company that receives most of its revenue from IRIX
based machines.  His group recently released CAPP and LSPP approved 
versions (yeay!) of SGI's proprietary IRIX Operating System.  Given
the proven success of Trusted IRIX in the security market, his views 
and actions may not reflect the best interests of the Linux Security 
Community or any of the individuals involved.

My interest is that of a software designer who has been too interested
in product quality, design and performance and has been chastened
because such issues don't bring in revenue and are not commercial company 
goals. Anything effort above the  "_minimum_ needed to get by" was often
considered insubordinate and recalcitrant.  In a commercial company, 
capitalistically motivated, this is true.  Commercial giants in the 
software world have demonstrated that quality issues rate well below 
features and schedule.

	Exactly.  :-)
