>From Mrs.Kara Jaap
Cotonou
Rep.of Benin
West Africa.

Dear friend,

I am a widow  to the late principal accountant of Sierra Leon central bank 
who was assassinated due to political hostility in my country.
For the sake of our lives,my children and i fled to the neighbouring 
republic of Benin where we are seeking refuge.
I must confess to you,our journey to benin was not a jolly ride as we 
encountered a lot of problems,most painful was a particular situation that 
left us in a state of penury and where we also lost our travelling 
documents,thereby making it impossible for us to travel now.
Mounths ago i was diagnosed with cancer,this futher made our lives more 
difficult as i lack funds to take care of my self nor my children.
I decided to contact you,seeking your assistance because i am having 
problems recovering a large deposit made by my late husband overseas since 
the company maintained that instructions left by my late husband the 
original depositor,states that the funds be "RELEASED TO ME OR A FOREIGN
REPRESENTATIVE ONLY", believing he would appoint someone by himself to 
represent him for the claim but eventually he died earlier.
This is the only hope my family has of surviving,paticularly my only son,who 
has so much dreams and i want to do the best i can to help them fufill thier 
dreams.
I am pleading with you to help us by helping us claim the funds from the 
security firm and most importantly, your ability to put the said funds into 
circulation wisely for our joint interest and relocating my son is a major 
considerable factor regarding our request as our knowledge on financial
matters is not enough to handle such amount of fund (us$16,000,000.00) 
sixteen million dollars.
In view of this, if you are touched to work with us in sincerity, by 
standing as my late husband,s foreign representative to receive the said 
deposit on our behalf, we shall embrace you as our family and will 
compensate you accordingly.
I am willing to share the money into half with you,that is 50/50%,all i 
really care about is the welfare of my children.
As you indicate interest, please contact my son Jacob Mouton on this email 
address (t_jap0702@walla.com )or call him on his private phone number Tel: 
+229-9-5713752  to enable him give you further information relating to the 
position of funds and the steps we shall take to finalize on the project,as 
my health conditions makes it hard for me to talk or go around.
Thanking you in advance for your kind and urgent response, more so for 
keeping our proposal to your self.

Sincerely
Kara Jaap.
