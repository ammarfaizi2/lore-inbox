Hi linux-kernel community,

I'm considering writing a driver for my Netgear PA301 Phoneline network card. Is any development on such a driver currently taking place? I have fair knowledge of c++ but have never written a network driver. I have also already contacted netgear for permission to reverse engineer the card for linux. Any recommended books, starting points? Any help would be appreciated.
