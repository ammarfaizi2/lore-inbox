Yes, exactly. Look at http://www.bountyquest.com

A patent gives the owner of the patent the right to _deny_ anybody
to use this "invention" (17 years when granted).

History has proved that inventions where done independantly in
different countries at almost the same time.

With software patents the chance that two programmers code something
up almost exactly the same way grows _rapidly_.

I don't like the fact, that somebody can deny me the use of my
own ideas. The whole idea of helping innovations with patents
is outdated.
