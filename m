New core code for kbuild 2.5 is available in
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kbuild/kbuild-2.5-core-2.bz2
Backout core-1 then apply this patch.

Changes from core-1.

  Do not set KBUILD_OBJECT for objects that are linked into multiple
  conglomerates, there is no unambiguous KBUILD_OBJECT value for such
  objects.  These objects will not be able to use module or boot
  parameters in the forthcoming merge of module and boot parameter
  handling.

  Create object directory before copying .prepend/.append files.  Fixes
  Richard Chan's bug report.

  make foo/bar.[si] works again.  Fixes Roman Zippel bug report.

  Correctly standardize relative names.  Fixes Roman Zippel "touch
  include/linux/mm.h" does nothing bug.  Only affected builds in common
  source and object mode.

  Update timestamps on files generated by make as they are used.  This
  removes some spurious rebuilds.

  Changes to the underlying database layout to reduce the mmap
  footprint.  This speeds up kbuild 2.5 on smaller machines.
