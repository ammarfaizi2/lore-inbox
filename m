but due to the fracas I had with his wife, Madam Loi and her son, Jude, it
causes a public Embarrassment and people came to know that I had been
having an affair with the President. But, not quite long,I was arrested,
together with his wife and son,in connection with the 27th July 2003,failed
coup, which I did not have anything to do with, but was alleged of Rebellion
charges and that I have been harbouring some of the dissidents and arms in one
of the villa, bought for me by the President.

But, now, I have been released and I am under immigration security watch list
and seriously monitored. All,I wanted from you is to assist me make claims of
the sum of US$10.3 M,I did deposited in Abroad, during our Pilgrimage visit to
the Basilique, Abroad as the other deposits documents have been confiscated and
seized by the the government of Madam Gloria, the President.
