Yes. The only reason I'm not going to commit myself to getting carried away=
=20
with seeking to merge it is that you've clearly stated that you don't want =
to=20
see it merged, and you haven't been overruled by other kernel maintainers=20
(with perhaps the occasional exception, sometimes privately). If they came=
=20
along to the party and said "Pavel, get your act together. Suspend2 isn't a=
s=20
invasive or ugly as you're making it out to be." (or something similar), I'=
d=20
see some point to working on merging it. If they want to tell me to submit =
it=20
again or prove that's the case, I'm more than willing to hear that. But whi=
le=20
the only feedback is users saying "I wish it was merged" and Pavel saying=20
"Ain't going to happen", what am I meant to do?

Regards,

Nigel
