I'm not aware of that being the case.  The output string
is formed into a static buffer and then copied into the
printk ring buffer all under spinlock_irqsave(logbuf_lock).

If there is something wrong then it would be occurring
at the other end - where data is taken out of the ring
and is sent to the console device(s).  The locking there
is OK, I think?
