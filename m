What we need is an "Oracle of Linus" like the "Oracle of Bacon" (aka the
"Kevin Bacon" game).  Alan Cox (along with a few others) has a Linus
number of 1 for example.  Now the tree just need to be defined better,
so developers can know their Linus number and know the best path for
them to submit patches.

Just a suggestion from a humble user (with a Bacon number of 1 :-) ).
