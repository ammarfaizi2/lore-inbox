Subject: Kernel with enabled APIC hangs on Micronics W6LI

Hello,

I have tried to enable APIC and IO-APIC on system with Micronics W6LI
mainbord with BIOS version H04. It is SMP PPro mainbord, but I have only
one CPU.

Kernel is only able to display "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the
kernel." and then hangs! The same problem exist if CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is
disabled but CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is left enabled. Without
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC system works.

I have tested 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-pre10 kernels. Any ideas?
