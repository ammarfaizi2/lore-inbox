Hello, all -

I'm tasked with developing a new SCSI driver for 2.4; but I'm running 
into issues that (a) SCSI drivers are different from other Linux device 
drivers and (b) none of the SCSI driver docs/how-tos seem to have been 
updated since 2.0.x.

I'm making progress, but could someone direct me to a list of do's and 
don't's for SCSI drivers in 2.4?

Also, anybody else looking at developing IB and or SRP?

Thanks a lot....
