A couple of good books also helps:

- Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, "The C programming language"
  (ANSI edition)
- Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike, "The practice of programming"
- Jon Bentley, "Programming Pearls"

And of course don't wait with kernel programming until after you finish
your studies. Do it right now. Subscribe to linux-kernel, and follow
the discussions. Test patches and improve them, get your hands dirty.
