Well, if it's all over hundreds of drivers, we'll gain a couple of
hundreds of lines ;)
Another good reason would be that it will prevent to forget the proper
calls, e.g. in the case you changed the busmastering in the main probe
code.

Anyway, it's just a little gain.  I don't mind even if such a function
is not exported.

That's nice.

I don't see others for suspends, too.
pci_disable_device() and pci_set_power_state() should be
driver-specific. 
(for example, ymfpci device doesn't like pci_set_power_state(3) - it
 won't wake up at the next time.)
