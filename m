I hadn't built one of these in quite a while, mainly because I could never 
get tvtime to run while booted to them, some sort of a dma related failure 
I think, so I rather dropped off the path here.

But the announcement was enough to make me try to build it, sort of the 
ultimate "can an old fart build it test", but the make exits with:

  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x16f25): In function `hrtimer_start':
: undefined reference to `hrtimer_update_timer_prio'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1

about half way thru the normal time.  config attached.  I don't think hires 
timers are enabled.

Comments?
