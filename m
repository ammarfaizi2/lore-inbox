I agree that this is going to be a very high-volume discussion.  OTOH,
this discussion is going to have a fundamental impact on nearly everyong
doing driver work in the kernel tree.  It's hard for me to conceive of
kernel hackers who wouldn't want to track this discussion and thereby
gain a much better understanding of the implementation and design issues
surrounding Linus driver development.  Taking the discussion to another
list is likely to fail and would also deprive many of having this
information in their faces, which is probably where it belongs.

Happy trails,
        Miles
