I reached an agreement with the members of my team and we agreed to keep this money to ourselves and then moved the box out of Iraq to Europe (we have also concluded plans to move the money out of this place as soon as possible.I'm in need your help as an individual or any company overseas whom I can confidently work with I have not finished my assignment and cannot return to the UK now.
