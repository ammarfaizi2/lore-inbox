Translation: We'd like to dangle a carrot in front of Linux users in hopes 
they'll try out this feature and possibly get interested in switching to 
Solaris because of it.  Don't hold your breath on us actually shipping 
anything.  But we didn't open source Solaris due to competitive pressure from 
AIX or HPUX users, so they don't even get the carrot.
