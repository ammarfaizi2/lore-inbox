Guys,

Each reply I post to this list gets me an email from this
person wanting me to confirm that the email is not spam.

Does this happen to everyone else, and if so can we just
remove him from the list for bad behavior/improperly configured
email?

I don't even want to think about what would happen if everyone
were using what he is using.

The address is: Cynbe ru Taren [cynbe@muq.org]

                     Roger
