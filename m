Nope. These structures get allocated once per display memory buffer, and 
a display memory buffer may be as large as
the AGP aperture size, (usually up to 512MB) or as small as one page.
The latter could be a user allocating a texture buffer for each 
character in a font, and they can be quite numerous, so we would waste 
almost 4Kb per buffer, which is not acceptable.

The drm memory manager sets aside and keeps track of a preset amount of 
memory that can be pinned in the kernel for video use, which is shared 
by all users running direct rendering clients. Currently this is a hard 
limit, but the idea is to unlock memory and make it swappable if 
resources become scarce. The memory we're discussing above is included 
in the bookkeeping.
