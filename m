Observations based on Roswell 2 and identical Abit BP6's: faster disk
I/O and kernel builds (same options), smoother X11 performance (SVGA),
higher LAN network I/O (switched LNE100TX) under heavy loads, and, none
of the recent latency or VM issues.  As for features, I don't need any
new feature specific to 2.4.

I see your point but everything since 2.2.19p2 been stable for my NFS
and app server testing needs as well as primary desktop machine.
