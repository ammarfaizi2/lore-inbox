Hell.Surfers,

Because when I was booted out of 2.5, effectively, the API for DFT was
deleted.  So you take away the means to make it work, and they stop moving
that direction.  Now that -AC series has the API, and 2.5 will see a full
return of it, I now have to restart the process to motivate them again.
However since Hitachi may end up buying out IBM's disk manufacturing
business and their product lines, I now have to go an try an court (old
dating term for the post 70's crowd) Hitachi.

Now, what do you want?
