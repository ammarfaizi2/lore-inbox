Good point. Would it be better if I forced break_active to zero after
some timeout?

Come to think about it, it's really strange that there's a single bit
indicating both start-of-break and end-of-break. I'll see if I can find
a way to tell the difference.

Ok, I'll fix it.

Out of curiosity, why does it return a value? ;)
