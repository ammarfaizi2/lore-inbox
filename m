i've tested the suse kernel, so the patch above was already in it.
i'm not sure whether mm tree already includes the all relevant
fixes... Chris?

what i wrote above about is loops in do_journal_end().  but i can't
tell you surely unless i test the mm kernel again.

AFAIK, even only the fix of mpage_writepages() will reduce the latency
very much.  please give a try.
