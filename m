Dennis:
I had the EXACT same problem with slow ftp transfers between boxes on my
home lan. I also had a RealTek 8029 card. Please take this card out of the
machine, walk it over to the trash receptical and drop none too gently.
I will guarantee you that once you replace that crappy excuse for a network
card with something better (Intel EEPro100, 3Com, or Tulip based card) your
slow ftp transfer problem will completely disappear.
