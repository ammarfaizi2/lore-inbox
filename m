thanks for rewriting the patch.

as i mentioned in another mail, my intension was to create another
"card" module for pc98.  sorry if my comment confused you.

as far as i understand, the mpu401 changes are necessary only for pc98
onboard chips.  if so, i'd like to see such like snd-pc98-cs4232
module which have both pc98-specific hardware initialization and
roland pc98-II mpu401 support, so that other parts can be kept as
clean (original) as possible.

or, if i misunderstand this (i.e. the patch is necessary for _all_
cards on pc98), please let me know.

anyway, i'll try to rewrite the patch (for alsa cvs tree) and send you
(perhaps) tomorrow.

ciao,
