You probably meant Anton in the sentence above...

The NTFS disk edit utility you were providing does quite a lot more since 
it is interactive. And my utility doesn't do everything I would like it to 
do yet but it does work so I wanted to push a release out of the door ASAP. 
But it doesn't really matter. The NTFS disk editor is a relatively freely 
available utility as I found out recently, anyways. It is present on the 
Windows NT4 Service Pack 4 CD! It's not mentioned anywhere in the 
documentation but it sure is there among the service pack files. I managed 
to dig the out in our College computer office and it's now officially mine. 
That has the advantage of not binding you to the license of only using it 
for repairing NTFS partitions... (-:

Best regards,

Anton
