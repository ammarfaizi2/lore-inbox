Yup. "SAS BOF"

Matthew, I am sorry your expectations for the BOF did not match. Heck,
*I* did not know where the
BOF would take us(!). Christoph voiced a concern that the principals
needed to get into the same
room together, and I rolled the ball ...

I do not believe it is productive to do a 'he sez, she sez', it
distracts us from the task(s) at hand.
