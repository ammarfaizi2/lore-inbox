My economics prefessor liked to say that the best test of a
socioeconomic system (vs. otehr systems) was the "Gates Test" -- open
the gates and see which way people run.

It will be interesting to see how the "land of the free" will treat its
own citizens in the next year or so.

Alan, how are things in the U.K. shaping up because of the WTC/Pentagon
events?

I wonder if I could be put in jail next week because of all that stupid
cuecat stuff I was involved in?
