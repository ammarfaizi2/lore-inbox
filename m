I'm not. I treated it just like any other document I couldn't read,
I asked for it in a sane format. The author kindly sent me it. The
rest of the thread is Larry's invention. I don't care what Larry
does with bitkeeper, any more than I care about clearcase.

The transaction is the same thing as 
"A word file, can yo send me that in text"
"Thanks"

the rest is touchy people inventing sinister plots that don't exist
