ftp.xx.kernel.org  where 'xx' is a country for the kernel(s)....

SYSV-init comes in various flavors, different with different
distributions.

The last 'init' I got was from tsx-11.mit.edu /pub/linux/sources/sbin.
There is a newer 'simple-init' in use by several distributions.
I think it's available on sourceforge (ftp.sourceforge.org). Use
www.sourceforge.org to search using keywords.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (797.90 BogoMips).

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
