Try not to be too harsh or confrontational, remember that the problem could 
be in -any- hardware between you and the website the poor sod is maintaining.

This is mildly offtopic, but does anyone have any useful stats of:
A) The number of ECN-capable hosts/routers
B) The number of ECN-hostile hosts/routers

If more of the internet fit in to the 'A' catagory than the 'B' catagory, I'd 
be very tempted to enable ECN and crusade against the remaining deviants, but 
right now it seems like merely an annoyance with no real gains.
