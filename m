Side note. I vaguely recall a distribution who's name has escaped me since. 
Thier selling point was "It's harder to install" and they claimed not to patch 
any source. "If it's good enough for the author, it's good enough for us". 
Might be worth checking out. If someone has a disro name for it, please...
