An easy setup for this is to put /home on a different filesystem than
/tmp, use quota on /home but leave quota off for /tmp. Then most Unix
systems can easily be configured to clean up /tmp periodically, and also
the user is easily aware of the nature of files in /tmp (i.e. they are
"elastic" in some sense).

My university was (and still is) using this setup on many servers.
