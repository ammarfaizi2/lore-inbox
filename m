You don't have to buy a company. There are white label manufacturers which are 
happy to produce any card you like (but how big will the volume be?). The 
point is just to find or design the chipset, from there on the card.
What is also possible, is just to design an open chipset like the openrisc 
guys did: They designed and published the design of a risc processor under I 
believe GPL (have to look it up).
If you let companies use that design to produce their open card, you will have 
solved the problem. Companies like Trust (Dutch white label company: Buy a 
stack of stuff, and put Trust label on it), will probably pick this up
