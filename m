I'm not running it on exotic x86_64 stuff, just an ageing athlon, but 
generally speaking the only thing I noted so far in about 4 hours 
uptime was a failed, several times, effort to download a file via http.  
But I left the browser sitting there for 20 minutes while I caught up 
on the mail, and when I tried it the next time it came in at about 90% 
of my dsl line speed, so it was probably an internet glitch unique to 
that site.

Otherwise its Running Fine, and the logs are clean.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
