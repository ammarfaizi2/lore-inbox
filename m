I recently bought a Netgear FA311 which does 10/100Mb/ethernet for my
first home network. I've looked and found driver sources which apparently
works only for 2.0.36. Ulp! Before I start cracking my knuckles and
working my deep magic to get it to work on 2.2.x, is there any drivers
already sorted for this card on the 2.2.x series?

If not, where can I find documentation on converting 2.0.x drivers to
2.2.x?

Thanks.

Cheers,
Alex
