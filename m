Maybe that is the wrong answer. It seems they have a bug tracking system.

See, you think you are doing the submitter a favour.
I prefer the point of view that the submitter does us a favour.

Something is wrong, and people work around it.
But they tell us about it. If we want we can try to fix.
Or we can store the information for later examination.
Very often it is needed later - fortunately Google helps.
A more focused data base might help even better.
