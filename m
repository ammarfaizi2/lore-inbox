Subject: [PATCH 4/7] Direct Migration V5: migrate_pages() extension
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add direct migration support with fall back to swap.

Direct migration support on top of the swap based page migration facility.

This allows the direct migration of anonymous pages and the migration of
file backed pages by dropping the associated buffers (requires writeout).

Fall back to swap out if necessary.

The patch is based on lots of patches from the hotplug project but the code
was restructured, documented and simplified as much as possible.

Note that an additional patch that defines the migrate_page() method
for filesystems is necessary in order to avoid writeback for anonymous
and file backed pages.

V4-V5:
 - Patch against 2.6.15-rc2-mm1 + double unlock fix + consolidation patch

V3-V4:
- Remove components already in the swap migration patch

V1->V2:
- Change migrate_pages() so that it can return pagelist for failed and
  moved pages. No longer free the old pages but allow caller to dispose
  of them.
- Unmap pages before changing reverse map under tree lock. Take
  a write_lock instead of a read_lock.
- Add documentation

+Page migration
+--------------
+
+Page migration occurs in several steps. First a high level
+description for those trying to use migrate_pages() and then
+a low level description of how the low level details work.
+
+
+A. Use of migrate_pages()
+-------------------------
+
+1. Remove pages from the LRU.
+
+   Lists of pages to be migrated are generated by scanning over
+   pages and moving them into lists. This is done by
+   calling isolate_lru_page() or __isolate_lru_page().
+   Calling isolate_lru_page increases the references to the page
+   so that it cannot vanish under us.
+
+2. Generate a list of newly allocates page to move the contents
+   of the first list to.
+
+3. The migrate_pages() function is called which attempts
+   to do the migration. It returns the moved pages in the
+   list specified as the third parameter and the failed
+   migrations in the fourth parameter. The first parameter
+   will contain the pages that could still be retried.
+
+4. The leftover pages of various types are returned
+   to the LRU using putback_to_lru_pages() or otherwise
+   disposed of. The pages will still have the refcount as
+   increased by isolate_lru_pages()!
+
+B. Operation of migrate_pages()
+--------------------------------
+
+migrate_pages does several passes over its list of pages. A page is moved
+if all references to a page are removable at the time.
+
+Steps:
+
+1. Lock the page to be migrated
+
+2. Insure that writeback is complete.
+
+3. Make sure that the page has assigned swap cache entry if
+   it is an anonyous page. The swap cache reference is necessary
+   to preserve the information contain in the page table maps.
+
+4. Prep the new page that we want to move to. It is locked
+   and set to not being uptodate so that all accesses to the new
+   page immediately lock while we are moving references.
+
+5. All the page table references to the page are either dropped (file backed)
+   or converted to swap references (anonymous pages). This should decrease the
+   reference count.
+
+6. The radix tree lock is taken
+
+7. The refcount of the page is examined and we back out if references remain
+
+8. The radix tree is checked and if it does not contain the pointer to this
+   page then we back out.
+
+9. The mapping is checked. If the mapping is gone then a truncate action may
+   be in progress and we back out.
+
+10. The new page is prepped with some settings from the old page so that accesses
+   to the new page will be discovererd to have the correct settings.
+
+11. The radix tree is changed to point to the new page.
+
+12. The reference count of the old page is dropped because the reference has now
+    been removed.
+
+13. The radix tree lock is dropped.
+
+14. The page contents are copied to the new page.
+
+15. The remaining page flags are copied to the new page.
+
+16. The old page flags are cleared to indicate that the page does
+    not use any information anymore.
+
+17. Queued up writeback on the new page is triggered.
+
+18. The locks are dropped from the old and new page.
+
+19. The swapcache reference is removed from the new page.
+
+20. The new page is moved to the LRU.
+
+This system is not without its problems. The check for the number of
+references while holding the radix tree lock may race with another function
+on another processor incrementing the reference counter for a page. In that
+case we will be in a situation where the page will linger until the reference
+count is dropped by that processor. There are no other references to the page
+though. The kernel functions would have taken a lock on the page if the page
+would have to be written to.
+
+The page is therefore likely just lingering for read purposes for a short while.
+The copy page code contains a couple of printks to detect the situation and help
+if there are any issues with the lingering pages.
+
