Some people might not realise that 2.4.20-rc3 and 2.5.49 are on-line, as the subject lines of the mails to the list are mostly Re: the initial request for them, so here is a summary of the mirrors:

2.4.20-rc3:

        ftp://zeniiia.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4
        ftp://zeniii.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4
        http://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4
        ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4

Thanks to Russell King for providing those and Andre for the original download.
