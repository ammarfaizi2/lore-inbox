Very true.  However (I can only vouch for the USA, but I suspect it's
  a similar situation elsewhere) the company with Loads o' Cash can keep
  those of use with Loads o' Debt cowed and tied up in red tape and lawsuits

Heh.  Criticism accepted.  Maybe one of the prerequisites for running for
  office should be Free Software / Open Source development.  :)  Seriously,

  start the Free Software Party.
