Grow up and stop spreading FUD. I haven't had to reinstall a Windows
2000 server ever since it was released (not that there were many that
I ever used. But I actually did and deployed apps on them). 95, 98 and
ME maybe. NT4 almost never and W2K is a quite stable platform even
under load.

I'm amazed that the most violent Windows critique comes from people
that claim to "never have touched a M$ operating system in their whole
life".  But then again, same goes to the Linux critics... :-)

	Regards
