First, CVS is COMPLETELY inadequate for the kind of distributed, 
non-centralized development that goes on for the kernel.

Bitkeeper solves some rather difficult problems that *NOTHING ELSE SOLVES* 
right now. This is why I've continued to use it for the last 2 years, even 
though I occasionally get annoyed that it's not free software.

Your efforts on this petition would be FAR better spent (and appreciated) 
by attempting to mirror several BK kernel trees with Arch or Subversion. 
You will soon find out the limitations of both, and maybe even improve 
both projects to the point that they will be useable instead of bitkeeper.

Instead of whining about developers using BK, go out and give us an
alternative. Maybe then we will listen.
