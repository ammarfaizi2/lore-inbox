I am not going to argue about that. But the last sentence of my previous	
email "is it true that if u obey clause 3a, u don't have to follow clause
3b ?" was the point I wanted to clarify which wasn't answered at that
time.

Source available on web was just an example. I just could not find a link
on the site which says something like "Apply/register to get source code
on cd/dvd/ftp/http/bla_bla media". Basically, 3b refers to 3rd party 
(who is not getting/buying the binaries) and my question was about that.

And u have answered my question now. Thanks for the clarification.
