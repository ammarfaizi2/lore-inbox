(CC to linux kernel)

I've got a 100% repeatable oops when booting my machine on a 64bit 
kernel (Athlon 64, Asus K8V, 1GB).

The problem occurs when hotplug initialises the usb subsystem.  In 32bit 
everything seems to run OK.  I'm not ruling out a BIOS bug here because 
if I enable Legacy USB support it oopses a lot earlier (ie. never gets 
as far as userspace.. can't get that oops though without a serial cable 
and that'll probably have to wait as I can't find one :)

Kernel is vanilla -pre6 patched with latest sk98lin driver (v618).

Tony
