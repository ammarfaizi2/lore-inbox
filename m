I'd prefer:

"Another Faustian Pact between Linux and Corporate World"

Let's be real:

Do you know all papers and words between Red Hat or OSDL
and say IBM or HP?

Did you regard Novell as linux defender or guardian-angel?

Are you afraid or more afraid?

Did Microsoft ever need Novell to sue anybody? 

I don't think so.
