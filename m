Hi

I never had to fill a kernel bug report in 5 years using linux 
- so please excuse me if I missed something here.This is kernel 2.4.20
vanilla and unpatched. Looks like something weird in usb.c.

Distro: Conectiva Linux 8.0
GCC: 2.95.3
Glibc: 2.2.4
Kernel config options: See below KSYMOOPS OUTPUT
Hardware: Toshiba Tecra 8000 PII300 128RAM 10GB

Thank you for your attention
(Specially if you consider that I handwrote the panic coz it couldn't
reach the disk).
