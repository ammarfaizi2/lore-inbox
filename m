Is there a PS2 protocol dumper?
I'm trying to work out why my mouse ("Clic browser mouse") won't work,
and can't seem to work out where I should be attempting to insert some
logging. (2.4.20, though I suspect it's probably the same for 2.5) 
I also have had problems in the past with some laptop keyboards, and as I
plan to start using the ones I've had problems with again, this could
also be relevant in trying to work out why they don't work with some kernels.


Thanks.
Ian Stirling.
