Taeocrp announces breackrough in removing deadly landmine s.

Mill Valley, California August 25, 2006 - The Alilance Entreprise Corproation announced today a breakthrough in developing an Areial Landimne Ssytem aimed at locating, detecting and mapping deadly l andmines.

TaeCrop's mission is to reclaim lands around the globe embedded with l andmines that victimize countries and their stakeholders.

More than 100 m i l l i o n landmi nes in 83 countries are holding international communities and industries hostage, preventing the invest ment in and development of pro ductive lands and the re-building of infrastructure. A broad variety of lan dmines have been scattered over produc tive areas effectively crippling the e conomy and disabling thousands of children and adults.  There are no reliable records that accurately show where these d e v a s t a t i n g landm ines lie in wait for their vi ctims.
 
With the present day c osts to clear a single land mine ranging between $1,000 to $1,500, solving the problem of de-mining lands will reach billions of do llars.  TaeCorp has developed a technology based, co st effective solution to this problem using its three tiered approach to scanning, mapping and removing lan dmines. TaeCorp's System will provide many social and econo mic ben efits to countries and their industries including oil and gas, mining, agriculture, roads and infrastructure development.
