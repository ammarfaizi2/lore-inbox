Hi all.

This is to announce that LinuxFund.org (http://www.linuxfind.org) have
kindly agreed to support me while I work on Software Suspend full time
for a while, beginning 1 October.

This development should lead to a faster completion of the 2.4 version,
and a faster release of the port to 2.6. Lord willing, a test version of
Software Suspend for the 2.6 kernel that has all the features of the 2.4
version will be available within a couple of weeks.

Regards,

Nigel
