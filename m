A while ago I read about these drives on lkml.
Someone was experiencing problems with them, and now I am too.
We have a sh*tload of systems using these in a Promise SuperTrak IDE RAID
setups.
So we have 8raid*6drives running over here, and I'm afraid that they will
start falling apart.

Does anyone have any info on these problems ?
URL:s, pointers, whatever?
Has IBM said anything about this?

Should I demand that the company selling these drives to us exhange those
for some other brand, or what?

Cheers

Magnus
