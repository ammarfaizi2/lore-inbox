Well most linux users don't.  I'm sure its really easy to find a morse
code chart in many hundreds of places online.  But 2 scripts - one
that turns keyboard input or mic input into dots and dashes (so you
can enter it yourself or put the phone up to the system's microphone)
would help.  Then all you'd need is a morse->ascii converter.

So who's got a good morse->ascii program?  And who has the
dot-dash->.-.-.- translator?  And the audio->.-.-.- translator?
