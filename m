Dear Friend
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds  transferred 
under the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay. Presently i'm in  
Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. 
meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in 
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary in Benin his name is Kiki Raymond on

you the total of $1000.000.00 which i kept for your compensation for all the 
past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your 
efforts at that time very much. so feel free and get in touched with my 
secretary Kiki and instruct him where to send the amount to you.

Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the 
joy after all the sufferness at that time. in the moment, Im very busy  here 
because of the investment projects which me and the new partner are having 
at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary 
on your behalf to receive that money, so feel
free to get in touch with Kiki Raymond, he will send the amount to you
without any delay.
