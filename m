Hi Kyle,

I see, I figured this is the place to ask technical question related 
to programming in kernel space.

Um, which part is illegal? Are you saying that I cannot have a non-open
source kernel module? If I figured correctly, to violate GPL I should
compile GPL code into my module.

It is a standalone module, not distributed with any custom kernel.

Certainly this needs to be clarified.

Br,
