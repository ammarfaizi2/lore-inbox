So what "private campaigning" is going on here, exactly?  

Dirk approached me because he was concerned that politics and poor
communication might be getting in the way of some valuable work.  He
asked me to have the kbuild team fill him in on the background, and I
relayed that request.  The kbuild team's discussion with Dirk is
taking place on a public mailing list.

I'm bewildered.  What's the problem here?
