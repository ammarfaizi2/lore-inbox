You forget a key aspect, the "GNU system Suite" needs a frame work to
function.

Let people travel the road of choice, and not dictate they have to ride
a bobsled straight to HELL^W(your definition of freedom) with you pushing 
all the way down.

Your definition of FREEDOM STINKS!

FREEDOM == CHOICE !

If people want to use "non-free drivers", they choose to execute the
freedom to do so.  Now, what is clearly stated in your text is, FREEDOM
means the vendor of the "non-free drivers" has NONE!

If people want to have "free drivers" then contribute them.
What I see is a lot of people wait for new technology to be supported,
yet do nothing to enable the ones who have access and are willing to take
the risks of dealing with the vendors who are paranoid.

> If NVidia cooperates with us this much, we should certainly pick up

What if they decide to thumb the nose at you?
What if they decide to withdraw their drivers?

Is your ego of "my way or no way" or "it is my license, I dictate its use"
or .... fill in the blank, sigh ... never mind.

You bang a drum of fair use for everything else which does not have GPL
stamped and pounded into it.  Maybe you should allow a little fair use in
your world of the license.  Oh, I am dreaming and so now to the rant!

<RANT RANT DOUBLE_RANT>

Execise your CHOICE and FREEDOM is yours.

FREEDOM to pick and use hardware which is not natively supported.
FREEDOM to use protocols which are not support.
FREEDOM to use drivers which do the task you desire.

or enjoy your CAPTIVITY with a loss of CHOICE.

CAPTIVITY, well there is the FREEDOM to use what is supported open.
CAPTIVITY, well this is not supported, no options available.
CAPTIVITY, no drivers capable, we suffer down time to wait for a
	sucker^Whacker^Wcodepoet^Wwhatever will slave for us.

Gee, it has taken 12 years to get to where we are now.
Is everything today which is in the kernel "fully functional" ?

Come on Richard, this is not your "printer".
It is something of beauty wrappered with a tarbaby in front of a briar
patch.  Ease up with the sticky fingered tarbaby, the briar patch is
enough of a boundary.

Next go pick and use words out of BLACK's LAW.
You risk it all with out drawing crisp clear lines.
All it takes is for one loss in court and the fear of legal action is
history.  The court battle may not fall in a circuit which is friendly to
your choice of words in the license.
