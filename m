Release 1.9.13: Mon Dec 24 13:36:24 EST 2001
	* SuperH rulebase corrections from Niibe Yutaka.
	* Corrections for Richard Todd's logic bugs.

The bug queue is empty.  However, Richard Todd and I will be testing more 
weird theorem-prover cases in the near future looking for problems, and
might well find some.

[President Clinton] boasts about 186,000 people denied firearms under
the Brady Law rules.  The Brady Law has been in force for three years.  In
that time, they have prosecuted seven people and put three of them in
prison.  You know, the President has entertained more felons than that at
fundraising coffees in the White House, for Pete's sake."
	-- Charlton Heston, FOX News Sunday, 18 May 1997
