[snip explanation of version issue]

And what about GNATS?  What about the others on 
http://www.a-a-p.org/tools_tracking.html ?  A number of those address 
the web-based concern.  Do any of them answer your other concerns?  If 
there are, where do those fail that bugzilla, GNATS, etc. get it right?

But I see that starting from scratch is just the way you work:

Well, have fun, good luck, and I do hope you come up with something 
useful and maintainable.
