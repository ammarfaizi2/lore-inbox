I got the RPM's and located them from an earlier responder to the post.  
It was just disturbing
that RedHat does ont include the sources when you install from binary -- 
which they always have
before. 

Thought I would ask folks since this is where people raise GPL inquiries 
(at least as a first step),
and it appeared to be the right place becuase the issue was resolved 
within 5 minutes of the post.
I do kernel development in a company that supports Linux and ships Linux 
appliances and I
have a lot of significant and valuable kernel development, so kernel 
development issues,
like "Where the hell have they hidden Linus' source code" are relevant.

I am glad Red Hat is still distributing the code, but I am disappointed 
they are no longer
including it in the base RPM install.
