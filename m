Hi,

I am a newbie to kernel programming. Can someone please let me know of 
the ways to pass information from the kernel space to the user space. 
More specifically, I want to make use of some parameters gathered by a 
kernel module into my user space code.

If this is not a correct forum for asking this question, then please 
direct me to the correct mailing list. Since I haven't subscribed to

Thanks in advance,
Abhinav.
