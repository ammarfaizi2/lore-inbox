I can't speak for Andrew or the rest of the OLS organizing team, but
as far as I know, there should be an OLS in 2004.  The 2004 kernel
summit will be July 18 and 19th (we've put down a deposit on the
Conference Center already), and OLS will be running the rest of the
week (from the 20th to the 23rd or 24th).

So mark your calendars, everyone!
