what SCSI raid controllers would you guys reccomend for use under 2.4?
there was a question friday about a specific Adaptec one that received no
response, I know there is support in the kernel for some from compaq and
from IBM, but I don't know how extensive this is and if it is a case of
linux being able to run on that card once it is configured from
DOS/windows or if the tools to configure the card are able to run from
Linux (or from BIOs boot menus)

any suggestions?
