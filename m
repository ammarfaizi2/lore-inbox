I just tried the following email address:

groudier@free.fr          writing to andre@linuxdiskcert.fr -> spammer
eroudier@free.fr          writing to andre@linuxdiskcert.fr -> spammer
groudier@club-internet.fr writing to andre@linuxdiskcert.fr -> accepted

So, it may look that 'free.fr' is in some spam list.

Thanks for the reply,
  Gérard.
