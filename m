Intermediate time requirement: go to groups.google.com, do an "advanced 
search" for author "torvalds@transmeta.com".  (Google bought the corpse of 
deja news a few months back, that's where it went.  Unfortunately the 
linux-kernel list is fed in there at least twice under different names, so 
you may want to limit the search to just one of the groups.)

Unfortunately the best thing you can say about google's list 
threading/reading facilities is that they aren't as bad as they used to be...

linuxtoday.com also tends to cover most of the linus and alan kernel 
releases, too...

And to find out information beyond the mere EXISTENCE of new kernel releases, 
there's always kt.zork.net... :)
