Hi!

I have a Sound Blaster Live! PCI that works pretty fine for me. 

I tried to run loki's Quake 3 Arena for Linux, and after several tries, I 
started to read the README file, and it said that Sound Blaster Live does not 
work as OSS. I found a reference to www.opensound.com, where they sell OSS 
drivers for Sound Blaster Live for $35.00 !! That's too much money for a 
sound driver! I've downloaded a trial, and it really worked to play Quake.

My question is: If the 2.4.9 kernel has support for Sound Blaster Live, why I 
have to pay for a damn non-GPL driver? Why it does not work to play games on 
linux?


Regards,
Thiago
