Hi,

I tried to contact AdvanSys/ConnectCom regarding a patch (also sent to 
these lists) a few minutes ago.

The URLs in drivers/scsi/advansys.c as well as the Email address 
support@connectcom.net listed as contact address in this file no longer 
exist.

The Email address linux@advansys.com in MAINTAINERS doesn't work since 
they have a broken MTA setup:

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at hermes.fachschaften.tu-muenchen.de.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.
   
<linux@advansys.com>:
Connected to 207.155.252.71 but sender was rejected.
Remote host said: 550 Invalid domain fs.tum.de

Does anyone know how to contact them?

TIA
Adrian
