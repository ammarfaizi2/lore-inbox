I can see it now.... Linus, go long!
D'oh!  He dropped it!  :-)

The sound effects from having folks forget to
switch off the mic before throwing it could be
pretty entertaining.

Seriously though, this would probably still be an
impediment to the sort of stream-of-conciousness
dialog that we'd like to have.  Sometimes, there
is a quick series of one or two sentence comments
from several participants.  With a "mike-in-a-ball"
your discussion might turn into a sports event.  
Plus, personally, I am a crappy ball thrower.  
If many of you have my level of athletic prowess, 
there'd be a lot of time spent scrambling under 
tables and chairs.
