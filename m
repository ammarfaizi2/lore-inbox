You could be chosen for this Life Time Opportunity.

The United Nation Development Loan and Scheme Project (UNDLSP) is a pet
task of the UNDP whose priority is to provide a low interest scheme loan to 
private individuals and companies to help combat the debilitating effect of
poverty globally. 

We also provide home equity line of credit, where our accredited bank gives
you a checkbook or credit card to make purchases, which then accrue against 
your home's equity. With this type of home equity loan, interest does not
begin building until you make a purchase and we offer superlative and low
interest rate. 

The essence of this loan is to empower enthusiastic individuals and
companies globally to create employment opportunities for their ward. Upon
qualification 
for the loan, our "Loan Appraisal Committee" (LAC) will determine an amount
suitable for your proposed business interest. The qualified candidates will 
single-handedly manage their business but will work in collaboration with
our Special Task Force from the UNDP General Advisory and Supervisory 
Department for a period of one year to enable the department prepare a
report and submit to the UNDP Governing Board on debt servicing potential
and 
recommend options for making monthly or quarterly payments towards the
interest and principal amount.    

The qualified candidates under this Loan Scheme have an option of applying
for loan between Five hundred thousand United States Dollars to Ten million 
United States dollars ($500,000.00 - $10,000, 000.00) depending on their
projected business scope, provided that the borrower have a good credit
record. 
The United Nation Development Loan and Scheme Project (UNDLSP) give a
period of 20 years for lenders to repay their loans.

The investment area is not limited and may include new businesses or
inoculation of funds into an existing business that requires expansion but
must be 
reputed to be profit oriented in all ramifications. Note that Governmental
agencies are exempted from this loan Scheme opportunity.  

Candidates who are interested in the UNDP Loan Scheme Project are advised
to send copy of their identification document, age, profession and contact 
telephone/fax number to the "Loan Officer" in De Hague, Netherlands and
request for "Loan Application Form" which must be completed and return to
the 
accredited Loan Officer who has the mandate to begin the process of
analyzing and verifying the information on the application form to determine
the client's 
creditworthiness. If qualified, candidates would receive their loan within
14 working days.  You may contact Loan Officer below:
