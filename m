    Probably I'm wrong here, but if the renaming took place, much
more people will probably convert to the new license if given the
change of choosing. I mean, we humans tend to do exactly the opposite
of what we are forced to do...

    OTOH, if the renaming takes place and almost nobody changes to
GPLv3, that's a thing to think profoundly about.

    That's what I think, too. Myself, I've re-released some of my
projects just in case I dislike the GPLv3 because I don't want my
license to be converted by the recipients of my code (they can pick
GPLv3 if they want). Probably I will convert to GPLv3, who knows, but
not because I lazily copied a disclaimer that says "any later
version", if I do a relicensing I'll do it on purpose. When I chose
GPLv2 I thought that future versions will correct minor legalese,
wording or things like that, but I never thought about the DRM thing.
While I don't like "tivoization", I'm not against DRM as a
technology, and the same can be applied to other chunks of the new
GPLv3 license draft.

    Unfortunately ;) I think that finally people will make a good
deal about all this fuss :)) And if they don't, I'm not worried at
all for the future of FOSS, because if a fork must be produced, it
will be. Killing FOSS is very hard ;)
