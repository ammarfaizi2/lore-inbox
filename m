This may be a dumb question, but is there some place where the arch
maintainers are listed?  Where the arch-specific trees are kept?  Where
would I go to get the latest set of relevant patches for alpha?

Grepping the Documentation/ directory for "alpha" I see nothing
relevant.  IMHO this should all be listend in one place.  Maybe
Documentation/Arch-Maintainers.txt.
