Actually, I work a Linux Network Manager job, and I support Solaris, Linux,
and MS.  MS only because some of the office folk would require more of my
time if Linux is on their system (they can't deal with it).  I do have the
choice to put Linux on everyone's workstation and tell them that's what they
must have.  Don't tell me I don't have a choice.  I make a lot more money
because I support Linux and Unix.
