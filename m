You could not hit the core point of this issue any harder!
This is one of the reason I have to sign all those massive restrictive
NDA's in order to obtain the SPEC's to publish "FREE SOURCE", and
currently having to write off the expenses for the legalese to make sure I
do not get trapped.

If you get to close, you get tatooed with NDA's.

I can heat my house for the winter in a few years when the first round of
NDAs expire!
