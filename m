Indeed it is.  Now, let me vent here for a moment...

I WOULD BE BLOODY GRATEFUL IF SOMEONE WOULD ACTUALLY TELL ME THESE
THINGS AHEAD OF TIME FOR A BLOODY CHANGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Every time something changes, something like 200 lusers write to me to
bitch & whine, and I have to do script maintenance as soon as
possible, despite anything else I may have wanted to do.  I am getting
rather sick and tired of having to second-guess the kernel
maintainers, and I would really like to get just a bit of
consideration in that manner.

Thank you,
