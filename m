Copyright law only _explicitly_ grants a monopoly on preparation of
derivative works.  However, it is trivial, and overwhelmingly common,
for a copyright owner to grant a license to create a derivative work
that is conditional on how the licensee agrees to distribute (or not
distribute) the derivative work.
