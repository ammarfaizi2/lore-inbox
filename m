I just signed this very important petition to my Senators and Federal 
Representative urging them NOT to allow drilling in the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge, our most magnificent wildlife sanctuary.  Drilling 
would cause great harm to this wilderness area which is one of the few 
truly wild places remaining.

Please go to http://www.savearcticrefuge.org, add your name and pass 
it on!!!

Or you can add your name by checking out a great cartoon animation at
