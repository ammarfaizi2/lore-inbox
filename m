  Or even worse: you stole my list of command centers and I don't
even know it happened.  At least with an audit trail you have a
chance of knowing your secrets have been compromised.

  Banks also seem to like the idea of a server that will crash
rather than transfer funds without leaving a trail.

  So how long till Linux gets decent auditing?  Is the SNARE code going
to get into the kernel?

  ...and on a related topic, if someone wrote a patch to optionally clear
the swap area at swapoff would it ever be accepted?
