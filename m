I hope that's not the opinion of all the kernel developers - where does that 
leave distributions like slackware, debian, and the rest that don't have the 
time or resources to modify the kernel themselves?  Every kernel release that 
is meant to keep developers "in sync", as you say, should be a 2.4.x-prex 
release, and the stable releases should actually be stable.  If this means 
slowing the release schedule, so be it.  You are proposing to release 
unfinished, buggy and unstable code and let the distributions pick up your 
slack.  It sounds like something Microsoft would do.
