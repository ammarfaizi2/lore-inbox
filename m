Establishing that something is a commercial break requires more than 
saying "Hey, that talks about features of X commercial product".  It 
involves *also* establishing that the commercial break doesn't apply those 
features to linux kernel programming in an instructional manner.  If you 
haven't done both, then you haven't done enough to justify removing said 
"commercial break" from the kernel archive.  As long as the "commercial 
break" is an instructional document I'll advocate that it stays where it 
is.  The *most* you will ever get me to agree to is the possible removal 
of obviously superflous and advocacy related statements that don't 
contribute to the instructional nature of the document.
