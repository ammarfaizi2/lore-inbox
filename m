Interesting idea, particularly for autogenerated metadata.  Some 
metadata, like
thumbnails and icons might as well be ordinary files though.  (Like some
icon and want to use it as background bitmap?  Just copy it, because
it is a plain file.  Or want to use it as clipart - fine, the word processor
supports bitmap files. . .) 

This is a case where something is "metadata"  only because it is used as 
such,
not because it has to be.  File-as-dir is an interesting concept for 
such cases,
because it is convenient to group the "metadata" with the file, have it
move with the file and so on.  But still have this metadata accessible as
a file because it isn't all that special.
