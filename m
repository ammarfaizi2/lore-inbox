Exactly the same problem in 2.4.  Your words on this subject previously..

"Get over it, you have a hardware problem period! I have drives that do this every time."

So which is it ?

It does this with every drive I've tried with it, so I'm incredibly
sceptical theres a problem with the drives, especially when they
work 100% fine on other controllers.
