er, thats a no. Just look into Japan, they have subbed movies, they have
 dual channel movies on TV (english/japanese) and they really struggle
and fight with even basic english. why? because it is too different to
their own language ...

OTH you might be right for european countries, I always think eg
Scandinavian countries are far superior in english because they see,
watch everything in english on TV, etc ... and I see it on myself, if I
wouldn't have started watching movies in english and reading books in
english I think I would be the same "no inglisch heare" ignorant like a
lot of my friends in Austria are ... adding a second thought to
Japanese, they all WANT to learn japanese desperatly ... its just
horrible difficult for them, weather a lot of austrians are not even
interested in doing so ... "english? why? I don't need it ..." ...
ignorants ...
