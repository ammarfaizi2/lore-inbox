Release 1.2.0 of the Open POSIX Test Suite is now available at <http://posixtest.sourceforge.net.>
POSIX Test Suite 1.2.0 is a significant release because of its complete threads core conformance tests, timers core conformance tests, complete signals, message queues, and semaphores conformance tests! Also there are added important POSIX functions such as the ones associated with sys/mman.h (thanks to Jerome M.). Bug fixes from previous release as well. 
The Open POSIX Test Suite is an open source test suite with the goal of creating conformance test suites, as well as potentially functional and stress test suites, to the functions described in the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification. Initial work is focusing on threads, timers, semaphores, signals, and message queues. 
Suggestions/comments/bug-fixes are always welcome!
Feel free to contact the posixtest-discuss list if you would like further information.
