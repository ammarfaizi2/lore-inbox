Turning off synchronous writes like this won't work!
The battery-backed cache can help you in that you can consider
data "written" once it is transferred to that cache.  Metadata must still
go synchronously into the cache though, or you get a broken fs
if ever your machine crash in the middle of a transaction. (Leaving
an update halfway in that battery cache, and halfway in main memory.
Then main memory dies from the power cut / reboot.)

The caching controller should report back to the linux device driver
that "data is committed" as soon as it hits the cache - no need to
wait for it to actually hit the platters.  This can help performance with
bursty writes tremendously - but it won't help you with long-lasting writes
as you will then be limited by platter speed as soon as the battery cache
is completely full.
