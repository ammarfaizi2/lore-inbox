 John, the problem is that documentation either lives within the code,
where it has a small chance of being kept up to date, or it lives
separately and hasn't a cat in hell's chance of staying accurate.  Add
in Linus's apparent lack of interest in documentation, and creating an
extra file is just a waste of time, which is a pity.

 I like the idea of better documentation, but I don't think we've
started to address the 'what' and 'who-for' questions yet.

(and if anybody wants to respond to me, don't expect prompt answers,
I'll be away from tomorrow until Thursday :)
