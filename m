I sent a mail for an issue and the plan to merge and waiting for comment

P.S. Russell, as my yesterday mail, it seems that you've got some

please calm yourself, please execuse me if my mailer changed your 
various e-mail addresses, but it was once.
(maybe, you have about 3 or more e-mails? it made me the confusion.)
