Maybe your invisible friend wisperid that to you: but
I DIDN'T AGREE TO HOLD OFF. The changes thus far are quite
trivial and should be a piece of cake to adjust too
for an averegely capable programmer wich you are not

the driver in question. I'm clear enough now? Or does
one have to be a psychiatrist to talk to you?
