Hi,

I'm tired of handcopying my oopses. I read of something like LKCD and
kmsgdump but then I saw that these are only available for 2.4. But wouldn't
something like that be more useful for a development kernel as 2.5?
Unfortunately I don't have a second computer for a serial line.

Is there maybe still some way to avoid copying the oopses by hand for 2.5
kernels?

Best regards and many thanks,
Axel Siebenwirth
