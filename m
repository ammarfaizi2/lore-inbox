Well, I've not checked the problem in detail yet (since I'm back from
vacation), but my rough guess is that snd_card_register() is indeed
called multiple times.
It's correct behavior as this function is supposed to be callable
multiple times.  Some components (like emux-synth) are implemented as
a kind of "plug-in", and they call snd_card_register() to assure that
the underlying card tree gets ready.

A simple fix would be like below.  Could you give it a try?
