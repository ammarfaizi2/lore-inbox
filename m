I think the main conclusion to be drawn here, is that the reporter who
covered this news, is a bit clueless when it comes to high-tech
situations. I remeber reading in the article that "...Sony Corp.'s
PlayStation 2 video-game console. Linux also runs the Sony product"

Ofoucrce, i think he ment that you can linux on the sony playstation.

Anyways, gues we better get used to those types of proclamations,when
the millions of aol users start running linux <grin>
