Announcing the availability of prototype real-time (RT)
enhancements to the Linux 2.6 kernel.

We will submit 3 additional emails following this one, containing
the remaining 3 patches (of 4) inline, with their descriptions.

Download:

Patches against the Linux-2.6.9-rc3 kernel are available at:

ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/realtime/Linux-2.6.9-rc3-RT_irqthreads.patch
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/realtime/Linux-2.6.9-rc3-RT_mutex.patch
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/realtime/Linux-2.6.9-rc3-RT_spinlock1.patch
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/realtime/Linux-2.6.9-rc3-RT_spinlock2.patch

The patches are to be applied to the linux-2.6.9-rc3 kernel in the
order listed above.

Subsequent announcements will include the links to the ftp site only,
to reduce email bulk on the Linux kernel mailing list.


Introduction:

The purpose of this effort is to to further reduce interrupt latency
and to dramatically reduce task preemption latency in the 2.6 kernel
series.  Our broad objective is to achieve preemption latency bounded
by the worst case IRQ disable.

We are in progress of porting to the 2.6.9-rc3-mm kernel series,
and would like to present our work at this stage, to request
general feedback, and interact with others working on similar kernel
enhancements.

These RT enhancements are an integration of features developed by
others and some new MontaVista components:

	- Voluntary Preemption by Ingo Molnar
	- IRQ thread patches by Scott Wood and Ingo Molnar
	- BKL mutex patch by Ingo Molnar (with MV extensions)
	- PMutex from Germany's Universitaet der Bundeswehr, Munich
	- MontaVista mutex abstraction layer replacing spinlocks with mutexes

WHY IMPLEMENT PRELIMINARY RT SUPPORT IN LINUX:

Our objective is to enable the Linux 2.6 kernel to be usable
for high-performance multi-media applications and for applications
requiring very fast, task level reliable control functions.

The AV industry is building HDTV related technology on Linux,
and desktop systems are increasingly used for similar applications.

Cell phones, PDAs and MP3 players are converging into highly
integrated devices requiring a large number of threads. These
threads support a vast array of communications protocols
(IP, Bluetooth, 802.11, GSM, CDMA, etc.). Especially the
cellular-based protocols require highly deadline-sensitive
operations to work reliably.

GPS processing, for example, requires hard real-time tasks and
guaranteed KHz frequency interrupt processing. Linux-based remote
controlled GPS stations at inaccessible or dangerous sites,
like the inside of Mt. St. Helens, stream live data via IP.

Additionally, Linux is being increasingly utilized in traditional
real-time control environments including radar processing, factory
automation systems, "in the loop" process control systems, medical and
instrumentation systems, and automotive control systems.  Many times
these systems have task level response requirements in the 10's to
hundreds of microsecond ranges, which is a level of guaranteed task
response not achievable with current 2.6 Linux technology.


Other precedent work:

There are several micro-kernel solutions available, which achieve
the required performance, but there are two general concerns with
such solutions:

	1. Two separate kernel environments, creating more overall
         system complexity and application design complexity.
	2. Legal controversy.

In line with the above mentioned previous Kernel enhancements,
our work is designed to be transparent to existing applications
and drivers.



Implementation Details:

We have substituted the definition of kernel spinlocks with
a mutex abstraction that uses the P-mutex from the Bundeswehr
University in Munich, Germany:

http://inf3-www.informatik.unibw-muenchen.de/research/linux/mutex/

The spinlock definitions have been abstracted to invoke
a crude but effective #define-based substitution of spin_lock
to mutex_lock functions (in linux/kmutex.h).

We have abstracted the mutex layer to allow configuration
and selection of the mutex implementation. We have used a
simple mutex implementation, but intend to support use of
other mutexes, for example the existing system semaphore,
or third party plugins such as the the FUSYN project.


Partitioning the Critical Sections:

A partitioning between critical sections protected by spinlocks
and critical sections protected by mutexes has been established.

There are currently some overlaps (or holes) in the partitioning.
It is possible for a task holding a spinlock to block
on a mutex, causing a deadlock. These deadlocks are resolved for
interactive tasks on UP by grace of the interactive scheduler.

We are eliminating this nesting of mutex-protected sections
inside of spinlock-protected critical sections.
Only a minimal set (teens) of the spinlocks will remain.
This set will be composed of spinlocks necessary to protect
immediate hardware, as well as minimal critical sections that
would not benefit from mutex-based preemptability.

Our broad objective is to achieve preemption latency bounded by the
worst case IRQ disable.  Total response latency (i.e, time to
initiate/complete an arbitrary system call) would still be bounded
by the worst case spinlock protected critical region.


Testing

This experimental code requires further enhancement
and is very much a work in progress.

The kernel is fairly stable, failing under high loads
and in low memory conditions.

The kernel has not been extensively tested on SMP systems.

We are reluctant to publish any performance numbers until
we have completed the mutex-spinlock partitioning and
provisioned support for RW locks.

At that point, we expect the worst case preemption latencies
to be in the hundreds of microseconds on a typical workstation.

We are acknowledging performance degradation due to the mutex
debug code and the abstraction layer.
We expect to be able to improve throughput as the code matures,
and the RT kernel becomes more refined.

Documentation/rttReleaseNotes file.

known problems and latest status.



Credits and Thanks:

We wish to acknowledge the precedent work that has
allowed us to build this framework, as cited above.

We would also like to thank Dirk Grambow, Arnd Heursch,
and Witold Jaworski of the Universitaet der Bundeswehr,
Muenchen, Germany.

We are providing this kernel patch as waypoint on the course
towards configurable responsiveness in the 2.6 Linux kernel.

Thank you

Linux-2.6.9-rc3-RT_irqthreads.patch
===================================
This patch is a hybrid of several IRQ threads implementations,
as cited above.
We have made some modifications to adapt wake-up to handle
the scenario where an IRQ thread could be blocked on a mutex
at transition of an interrupt.
                                                                                
We expect to revise this IRQ thread code after moving to
the mm kernel series, and while incorporating the voluntary
preemption code.
                                                                                
This patch adds options to the 'General setup' section of
the kernel configuration. Running irqs in threads is
prerequisite for the subsequent patches. We have provided
defaults for running softirqs in threads, and have selected
Ingo Molnar's IRQ thread implementation as default.                                                                               
                                                                                
CONFIG_SOFTIRQ_THREADS
                                                                                
- required for RT kernel. Runs all softirqs in softirqd
                                                                                
CONFIG_INGO_THREADS
                                                                                
- enable Ingo Molnar's version of IRQ threads. This is not
  in sync with the latest releases in the voluntary preempt
  series.
                                                                                
CONFIG_IRQ_THREADS
- version of IRQ threads posted to LKML by Scott Wood.
  This appears to have been superceded by Ingo Molnar's changes.
                                                                                
                                                                                
In addition, this patch includes a port of Ingo Molnar's
proposed substitution of the BKL into the kernel semaphore.
