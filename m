If you have one of those junk PCs that the major companies keep
buying, look at the label; "Designed for Microsoft Windows".

This should tell you how little bluff-factor the "Linux fringe"
can pull.

In spite of the imminent destruction of major companies IP by
the incredibly stupid Windows OS, they still use it. Like lemmings
being led to the sea, most companies can't accept that M$ is
a defective, bug-ridden, and security-holed system. Instead they
think that M$ couldn't possibly be as bad as has been proven and
documented.
