   Sure, except no-one cares about this point.
   
   the documentation is the 'sticky wicket'...

Incorrect.  The argument for the documentation was that it along with
other things wrt. BK create some "barrier to entry" for Linux kernel
development and almost force someone to use BK.  That someone just
submitting patches is somehow "left out".

Al is showing that these claims are not well founded at all.
