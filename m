I find it incredible that this thread has been allowed to continue for so
long when in recent memory a certain someone was kicked off of lkml for
posting off-topic garbage.

Yes, this thread is closer to home, but I don't see what it has to do
with Linux-Kernel.  Especially considering that it does seem appropriate
for bk-users (if such a list exists).
