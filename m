... and another - AFAICS obvious - trivial ("prior art") patent (but I'm
not fluent in patent quak, I'm just a simple systems engineer).

And one more reason to sent the European software patent directive
simply to hell, clarify in §52.2 to not patentability of "software"
discarding the word play of the patent attorneys and offices and get
into the head of the folks of the EPO (with whatever means are
necessary).

Apparently Canopy Group/SCO/... are not of the front of innovation since
"what is new on a RAID system in any way in 2005"?

Or simply drop the whole patent system as such. Apparently it is only
abused to make money of the inventions of others and for sure does not
help innovation as such in any way (it may help the lawyers, offices and
companies in that area - patent utilisation - to get rich but that area
has nothing to do with innovation).
