Hi, I'd like to thank everyone that helped me with the compiler problem.
I've updated everthing in Documentation/Changes I have a brand spankers
new gcc, ppp, etc.  The problem I'm running into now is when I try to
connect to the internet, it says that I don't have a kernel that supports
PPP.  I've tried compiling it in as modules and as part of the kernel but
when I try to connect to the isp I keep getting the message that I don't
have a kernel that supports PPP. I've even contacted my System
Administrator, Hi Chris ;^).  Any ideas on what I could try next?  A cc
would be great, as I'm not on the linux-kernel list.

Thanks

Good judgement comes from experience, and experience -
well, that comes from poor judgement.
