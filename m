If you look at the stuff published by "Security Innovation, Inc.",
in the same link, you can see that they don't presume that the report
will be read by anybody who knows what they are talking about. They take
the PUBLISHED possible problems with Linux and the PUBLISHED possible
problems with closed-source Microsoft and compare them as
"security vulnerabilities".

It's just the usual crap. Oh, they finally changed the software
in their ftp site so it claims to be Microsoft. For many years
they forgot about this and used the Sun ftp. At least it doesn't
respond to WIZ anymore!

Cheers,
