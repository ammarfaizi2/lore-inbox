Just to put it out there- there are places in the world where the legal
system isn't based on case law.  Don't know if Spain is that way or not.

An interesting parallel are 'no-compete' clauses which employers use to
try and keep employees from being able to move from one company to a
competeing one.  These clauses are actually not enforcable in some
jurisdictions because the lawmakers there felt it was unreasonable.
This, really, is the light under which I'd think the BK license would be
seen.  Of course, IANAL, nor do I actually use (or have ever used) BK 
anyway.

That's an unfortunate reality (the money bit).

It's unlikely that a jury would be involved in such a case since it's
unlikely the facts themselves would be in dispute.
