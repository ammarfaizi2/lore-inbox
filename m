I didn't know that. But since the "proper console" would usually mean
at91_serial, I'd have to remove console_initcall() from there and call
it directly from setup_arch().

I suppose I could just remove the EARLY_PRINTK crap now and worry
about driver modifications later.

Will do.

It was written some time before the drivers/dma stuff. I suppose I
should try to use the DMA subsystem instead.

As I understand it, though, drivers/dma is mostly for memory-to-memory
to transfers, while what I really need is memory-to-hardware and
hardware-to-memory transfers.

I'll just drop the DMA controller stuff for now as it doesn't have any
users yet anyway.

I'll sync up with i386. By the way, are there any syscalls I
_shouldn't_ have wired up? It's probably too late to remove any of them
at this point, but if we get it sorted out quickly, we might get away
with a shorter grace period than usual...

Will do.
