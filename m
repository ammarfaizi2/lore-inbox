"Don't worry, Mr B., I have a cunning plan to solve the problem."

"Yes Baldrick, let us not forget that you tried to solve the problem
of your mother's low ceiling by cutting off her head."

"But this is a really good one. You become a dashing highwayman, then
you can pay all your bills and, on top of that, everyone'll want to
sleep with you."


Okay, anyone else has found Mandrake resemble Baldrick?  Maybe it's not
so ugly-looking but their ideas are clearly of the same philosophy.
