No, I'm saying that you should dream up new stuff on your own instead of
complaining about the licenses of the software that other people dream 
up.  If you want open source software, then *create* some.  If all you
are able to do is copy some existing software, you're profoundly limited
in what you can accomplish and you are really big trouble if your copying
cuts off the supply of things to copy.

It's sort of like saying "Daddy is paying for college but when you get 
out of college you have to figure out how to make a living, you might
want to start thinking about that".  In fact, it's a lot like that.
