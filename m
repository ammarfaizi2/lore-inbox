	All of the licensing terms in the GPL are subject to change by
a court of law, or by legislative action.  Nonethless, Copyright law
is generally agreed (IMHO, and based on past discussions of this topic
on this and other inappropriate forums) to be based on textual
derivation rather than functional dependency.

	Usual disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer.
