When I upgraded from 2.4.6 to 2.4.16 my gamepad stopped working. All 
the proper modules are created but I get is: 

/lib/modules/2.4.16/kernel/drivers/char/joystick/ns558.o: init_module: No such device  

Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including invalid IO or IRQ parameters  

/lib/modules/2.4.16/kernel/drivers/char/joystick/ns558.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.4.16/kernel/drivers/char/joystick/ns558.o failed  

/lib/modules/2.4.16/kernel/drivers/char/joystick/ns558.o: insmod joystick failed   

my modules.conf and .config are attached
	thanks
