Sir,

Most respectfully I beg to state that for starting
kernel hacking and research,
I require your help regarding GNU/Linux System.


*(Detailed) Info regarding, changes between various
kernel version since 1st "Official
 Release" till now? and/or a time-line describing
these changes? 

*What are features of Linux 2.6?

*What are the plans for future versions of the Linux?
Or what essential features
 (I'm not an advocate of "creeping featurism") still
lacking in kernel
 (specially comparing with other UN*Xs)?
 
*Suggesions regarding crash course on kernel hacking
and System Programming?
