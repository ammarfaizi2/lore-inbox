Hi All!

2 months earlier than expected we are now pleased to announce the release of 
Umbrella 0.5, which implements the 5th milestone of the Umbrella Roadmap
(http://umbrella.sourceforge.net/article.php?story=20040223071710880)

The new changes include:

* Now it is possible to import restrictions from signed binaries, as described 
   the 5th milestone in the Umbrella Roadmap.
* Several memory allocation bugs have been corrected, and Umbrella is as 
   stable as ever because of this ;-)
* The code has been optimized in several places. Thanks to Emmanuel Fleury for 
   the "function of the day"-patches! 

The new features of signing files are described in the articles
* Signing files for Umbrella
   http://umbrella.sourceforge.net/article.php?story=20041007012309509
* Reading signed files in Umbrella

The very best regards, from
The Umbrella Team.
