   That's someone, who doesn't understand what free software is about and
   desperately looking for someone to blame it on.
   What are you trying to tell us?

Roman, how do you pay for things like FOOD and a place to LIVE?
Who does what kind of work to provide the money you need for
the basic necessities in life?

Unfortunately, the real economics of the world right now does not make
it so that every programmer can work on %100 free software for a
living like I do.

That is a fact.

Given that, most programmers have to find another way to put food into
their stoamches and have a horizontal surface to sleep on at night.

The person who wrote the article in question may have a few
inaccuracies about how free software works, I'll give you that,
but that guy has a perfect understand about how REAL LIFE works.
That is where you need understand things better.
