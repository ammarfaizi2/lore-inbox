That isn't the normal way of doing things around here. Linus has always
taken the approach of picking who he trusts to hand stuff onto, as have
others when handing on further.

2.6.16-stable is in the hands of someone that Greg (2.6.17-stable, ex
2.6.16-stable, 2.6 head temporary chief maintainer) thinks is a good
person to do the job. That sounds to me quite sensible selection
criteria, and Adrian is certainly up to the job.
