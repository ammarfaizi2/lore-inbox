I don't see any more technical problems with your patches. You still need
to proper patch description and Signed-off-by: line like it is described
in Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
You can add an 'Acked-by: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>' line to the four
patches you posted last if you like.

I'm not that familiar with the process for non-driver patches for netdev
(nor for device drivers as it seems ;-)), but my understanding is that you 
should address those to Jeff Garzik as well, asking for inclusion in the
netdev-2.6 git tree in your introductory '[PATCH 0/4]' mail.

Since the official merge window for 2.6.16 is now over (2.6.16-rc1 has been
released), it may have to wait for 2.6.17 to become part of the mainline
kernel, that probably depends on Jeffs judgement.

I would think it can still go in since it is a bug fix for the execution of
32 bit programs using x25 ioctls, but it's clearly not my decision ;-).
