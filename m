yes , this is what i am looking for :)

Can we use "HP Jornada 600 series" inspite of "WindowsCE machine" ?

BTW, in Jornada 600 series only Keyboard and LCD is working and some CPU
related stuff  which we can found in Hitachi Manuals , thats it .

But linux-arm is supporting full iPAQ hardware .

Thank you,

Best Regards,

Jaswinder.
