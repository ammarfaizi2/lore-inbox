While not responding to mails is not nice, demanding a response isn't
nice either. Jeff Garzik or any other kernel developer has no support
obligation to you in any way or form.

Maybe think about if there's more information you can supply to make it
easier for the developers to diagnose (this is the most common reason
bugs aren't looked at, just plain not enough info to even begin thinking
about it)... or look at the code yourself, or try to find where this
behavior started, or .. or ...
