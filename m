You never know what you can do till you try. 



Hasty judgements are generally faulty. . From trivial things, great contests often arise. . Windows will never cease. . It's no use closing the stable door, after the horse has bolted. .

The gods help them that help themselves. . From trivial things, great contests often arise. . As is the gardener so is the garden. .
A good thing is all the sweeter when won with pain. . Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. . Kill two birds with the one stone. .

Divide and conquer. . A friend to everybody is a friend to nobody. . Speak clearly, if you speak at all. .
