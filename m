I have either a (wired) networked laptop, without a mouse, the lack of which
is slowly destroying my hand, in a 2.4.x kernel, or a no-network-device laptop
with a marvelous pain-free mouse, in a 2.6.x kernel.

I'd like to have both, in either kernel. If anyone has a solution, I'll make
a contribution via PayPal to the software project, or developer of the clue
provider's choice. My hand really hurts.

Eric
