I don't use CVS for most papers, proposals, etc,, that I write.  If the 
version control was turned on with something like a chattr, I would use 
it, and emacs could get rid of that damned ~ file that clutters my ls 
commands of what should be a listing of only my current version of my 
home directory without old versions of files being listed (the disk 
space I don't care about, it is the clutter that annoys.)
