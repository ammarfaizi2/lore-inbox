Unfrotunately, this is very off topic for this list, as evidenced by the many 
sarcastic replies.

Variable: from real cheap to 1 million dollars or more . It all depends on 
your means and the means of the rest of the family.

I'm sorry to be unable to provide more concrete answers to your questions, 
but w/ such huge variances in this "culture", it becomes exceedingly 
difficult to pin down.
