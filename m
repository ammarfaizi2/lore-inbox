Now that sendmail/load average  problems have been nailed for 2.2.18>
2.4, the mailing lists are working.  We apologize, but the server was
upgraded and during the upgrade, most folks addresses got zapped in the
var/lib/majordomo/lists directory, so folks who want to track Andre and
our work on the ring 0 Linux on the MANOS kernel will need to sign back
up at majordomo@timpanogas.org again.   As much as this has happened in
the past on LKML,
everyone is probably used to ir already anyway.  

Thanks,

Jeff
