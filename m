It was just my RL example. Such an (unnecessary) addition to modutils
would basically screw me.

Don't get me wrong though. I see tainting of the kernel by the addition
of a bin-only driver as necessary. I don't see why Alan Cox or anyone
else should support nvidia's drivers. It's upto nvidia to do it. IF they
want help, they should open the source up.
