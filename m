objective, arent we?

There is much truth to the concept, although Microsoft should not be ones 
to comment on it as such.

For example, if there were six different companies that marketed ethernet 
drivers for the eepro100, you'd have a choice of which one to buy..perhaps 
with different "features" that were of value to you. Instead, you have 
crappy GPL code that locks up under load, and its not worth spending 
corporate dollars to fix it because you have to give away your work for 
free under GPL. And since there is a "free" driver that most people can 
use, its not worth building a better mousetrap either because the market is 
too small. So, the handful of users with problems get to "fit it 
themselves", most of whom cant of course.

Theres also the propensity for mediocre stuff to get into the kernel 
because some half-baked programmer was willing to contribute some code. The 
50% of the kernel that remains "experimental" ad infinitum is evidence of that.

The biggest thing that the linux community does to stifle innovation is to 
bash commercial vendors trying to make a profit by whining endlessly about 
"sourceless" distributions and recommending "open-source" solutions even 
when they are wholly inferior. You're only hurting yourselves in the long 
run. In that respect MS is correct, because those with the dollars to 
innovate will stay away.
