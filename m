Oh, I wasn't suggesting trying to preserve a link to the E-Mail via
the scripts->BK chain.

What I was thinking of was each time you import a patchset from a
[mail | set of mails], BK makes that in to a changeset, which can't be
referenced directy in the changelog, because the changeset's id can
change in the future.  Is there no way that BK can generate a
reference to the HTTP interface to bkbits that will remain constant,
and can therefore be included in the changelog, (as an URL to retrieve
a patch from).  Even if the patch can't be applied to any particular
tree, it's still something that can be refered to in a mail to LKML,
or similar.

John.
