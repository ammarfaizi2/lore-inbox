You didn't mention what type of 6500 it is?  PPro?  PII? PIII?  How man 
processors installed?

We use almost exclusively proliants where I work, most 3000's, but we do 
have a 6500 that is a quad PPro 200.  I have spoke with Compaq and they 
didn't believe there was any driver
for the LCD screen nor were they going to contribute to one (this was 
about a year ago.)

The 6500 also used to freeze up a lot under NT4, but since switching to 
linux we have experienced no ill effects with it.
