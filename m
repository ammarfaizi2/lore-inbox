This is very intesting seeing as the story I read in the Newspaper (USA
Today) on encryption and terrorism today is an example of this.

It seems that people are using open source software to do idiotic
things. Many open source references were made in the article, I should
see if the article is online at all to maybe be able to use it as a
reference.

The only thing is that the good uses of the software are still
promenent, and what really bugs me is that the Government wants to step
into having a "Master Key" for everything as such... they can decrypt
stuff as is, but they have to spend lots of money if they want to do it
and that'll keep them in check verses having a "Master Key" that can
decrypt everything in a given encryption method.  That's just plain
stupid.
