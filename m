--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In less than a decade, clusters of commodity PCs have become the most
  cost-effective computing platforms for executing a wide range of
  high performance applications from molecular biology simulations to
  search and indexing on the Internet.

  In spite of countless deployed platforms and resounding application
  successes, many research and development challenges remain for achieving
  better performance, scalability, and usability. The IEEE TFCC Cluster
  2005 conference provides an open forum for researchers, practitioners,
  and users to present and discuss issues, directions, and results
  that will shape the future of cluster computing.

  As cluster architecture is becoming a more mature field of
  application it remains particularly important to maintain an event
  that links the academic interests and new ideas to the experience
  reports of practitioners and application developers.

See the upcoming Call for Participation for more details.
