Dear Sir,

I am emailing regarding some problems I have been having with the touchpad 
on my laptop (a hp pavilion dv5046ea  running Fedora Core 5 x86_64).
[ Here are the specifications for my laptop: 
http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/ho/WF06b/21675-38187-38191-38191-38191-12319008-69074479.html]


Support for my touchpad seems to have gotten worse rather than better in 
successive kernels from 2054 onwards.

While on 2054 it generally works fine, On the latest kernels (2154, 2174 
etc.)  I have only to e.g. open a konqueror window for the onscreen pointer 
to start going funny, and jerking about (As happens on computers with v. low 
RAM).  I know its not a RAM problem, as a) everything else works fine, there 
is no slow down of any of the programs I run, only problems with the mouse 
and b) I have just upgraded from 512 MB of RAM to 1 GB.

If I plug in a mouse, the pointer works fine.  Though I would happily use a 
mouse, this is often inconvenient on a laptop.

Do you have any ideas what's wrong?

Thanks
LS
