The Athlon XP/MP SMP issues (as well as the VIA chipset issues) are becoming
quite FAQs.  It strikes me a kept-up-to-date site listing current issues that
are known/being fixed/hardware bugs/whatever would be useful.  I would be
prepared to have a go if some maintainers (/knowledgeable kernel hackers) could
give me some info, but I'm certainly not a kernel guru and would not be able to
handle troubleshooting mail from all Linux's AMD users :).

I could quite easily hack together something in PHP for listing known
working/known broken configurations (proc/mobo/?), I guess.  

Thoughts/suggestions?

Joe.
