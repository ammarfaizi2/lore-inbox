Hi guys,
sorry to bother you again but tring to collect more details, browing 
into the kernel version change log files  I've found that (it can be a 
coincidence) but the lates kernel version I was able to re-compile by 
myself that doesn't brake my Logitech PS/2  Wheel working  support is 
the 2.6.7. At that version something was changed on the PS/2 driver... 
and I can't get it working anymore ....
Hope this can help to find out any reason ...
Best Regards,
 Davide
