Hi Jens.  

Maybe Mike Black is a kernel hacking guru and, therefore, 
deserves your impatience.

I send in a lot of bug reports.  I don't sigh about finding
bugs, because I enjoy testing and want to contribute to the
kernel evolution as much as possible.  Testing is my core
competency, so that's what I focus on.

Anyhow, it's helpful when developers are patient with
the limitations of us testers.

	Miles
