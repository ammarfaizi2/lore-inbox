You can't be serious. Software doesn't get the opportunity
to select the hardware. With Linux on PC-like machines, we
have been able to write and debug 90 or more percent of the
software on our work-stations before embedding it in the
target machines.

You get rid of that capability just because you don't
__like__ i386???  Did you ever have a job?
