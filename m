Subject: SATA (Serial ATA) support in 2.4.x?

   what's the status of SATA support in 2.4.x kernels?

   it seems like the first kernel that supports SATA is 2.4.21-ac4. I 
found few messages on lkml but not much more info about status of 
development.

   I am specifically interested whether it should support disks above 
137GB (as I have problems accessing anything above 137GB on 250GB SATA 
drive)

   any info/answers/pointers to docs?

   (I already posted a message here about 137GB & SATA but got no 
answers so I am trying somewhat different question)

   TIA

	erik
