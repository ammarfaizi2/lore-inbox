and even windows users can filter properly. netscape allows you to add
custom headers to filter on. So absolutely no problems for netscape
users.

Those tied to outlook (as i was when i worked at compaq, until i found
an exchange server that did imap) also have no need to complain as i
managed to get it to filter l-k without problems -> use the outlook
"Ru1eZ W1z4Rd" to setup a filter to catch anything "sent from
linux-kernel@..." and then another filter to look for the l-k list
info text included at the bottom of every mail.  (this rule should be
last.)

hey presto, l-k neatly filtered away with Outlook.

if you use an MUA that can't do filtering, well then there's something
wrong with you....
