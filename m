I don't want to bomb them, either. I see that NVidia is in
competition to ATI and others and that they don't want to release
their sources to stay ahead. But breaking the GPL is not acceptable.

Recent news have shown that some very big companies (much larger
than NVidia) don't give a dime for the rights of others, if it
is not in their interest. If more and more companies break the
GPL without any consequences, then the GPL will become meaningless.

Talking about the other side: Some months ago NVidia dropped
support for some old (3 yrs, AFAIR) graphics cards in their
proprietary driver. They could have considered to release the
sources for this "old stuff" instead.
