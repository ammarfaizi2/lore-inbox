Hi,

How would you like a 100% tax free Investment in Oil and Gas wells? 
Annual returns have been over 90%.
If you are liquid for at least $10,000, email your 
name, address, and phone number to 
oilandgaspackage@aol.com and we will send you the information.

Thanks,

Chris Wright
President
First Financial, Inc.
