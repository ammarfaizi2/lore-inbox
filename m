For some reason, seeing "virii" is somewhat painful to my eye.
I know, people invent fantasy plurals, like Vaxen and Unices/Unixen,
but somehow this is worse, yes indeed, it is badder.

[The singular is virus. The plural in English is viruses.
In Latin there is no plural - it is even debatable whether
virus is a noun in Latin - in any case it is indeclinable.]
