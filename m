It seems I found a workaround.
The backup script ejects the medium with a "eject /dev/sda". Directly
after that, the script looks with a "dd" if there is a new medium in
drive and this is exactly the point, where the "dd" hangs.
I inserted a "sleep 30s" between the "eject" and the "dd" and now it
works.
