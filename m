Oh yes, on top of that, if you want case insensitivity, then you also
need to start thinking about a whole lot of other things, including
what normalization form(s) you care about.  Keeping normalization (as
well as case-conversion) data for the entire Unicode space in the
kernel is a boatload of memory.

Then, you have to deal with your filesystem going sour on you when two
files suddenly alias, because there is a new revision of the mapping
tables.

Case seemed simple when we were dealing with the "let's teach them all
English" world, but even when you're dealing with languages like
German (ÃŸ) or Dutch (Ä²) things get fuzzy... what's worse, in
Turkish the uppercase equivalent of "i" (U+0069) isn't "I" (U+0049),
it's "Ä°" (U+0130)!  There is no table which can tell you that, since
it's context-dependent.  Thus, you may now need to consider larger
equivalence classes, but is the other user expecting the same thing?
You can't just use the same base letter being equivalent everywhere,
or a Swedish user would beat the sh*t out of you for confusing the
words "vas" and "vÃ¤s".  On the other hand, the Swedish user would be
perfectly happy having "Ã¤" equivalent with "Ã¦" and "Ã¼" equivalent
with "y"!

Therein lies madness.
