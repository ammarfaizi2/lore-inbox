THANKYOU FOR SHOWING A BRAIN.  Unfortunately, im after, chipsets, that are without, a A3D CHIPSET, however,that,can send output voltage. To the line in, but the chipset vendor has not mentioned it. My via ac97 can as I found, when i sent it input commands not in the vendors docs

I know that the C-Media 8738 chip is at least capable of doing so, as it
does in some 4/6 speaker configurations.  The ALSA and OSS drivers have
options like "Use Line-In for Rear" and "Use Line-In for Bass," etc.

Hope that helps, sounds like an interesting project you're working on.
