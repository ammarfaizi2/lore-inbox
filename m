While I've been generally saddened by Alan Cox's and others
anti-America attitude,  I am somewhat surprised to find that
Alan believes the US bombing of Afghanistan is justified and so
is the collateral damage as they call it.

Alan's point being that a population of a State can't be innocent
of the actions of their government, something, by the way, with
which I disagree.

Strange though, while the US has delivered hundreds of millions of US
dollars in aid to Afghanistan both before and after 9/11, Alan would
deny US citizens some of the tools with which to change things at home.

Alan asks us to rebel, but then denies us at least some of the
avenues we might take.  Others claiming for him that he doesn't
want to risk jail.  What if every aid worker in Afghanistan
and elsewhere around the world had the same attitude?
