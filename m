I bought this today!  If you are in UK, here is the best deal I could find - 
Â£22.00 + free delivery - I ordered this morning, it is dispatched already:

http://www.compman.co.uk/scripts/browse.asp?ref=706766

Why US on-line books are at least half the price of UK ones, I don't know., 
but of course then shipping costs/time buggers that up.
Rip-off UK, I suppose.

Thanks for the tip - I have been after a kernel book for ages, but wasn't sure 
what to get.
