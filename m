oh never load two these modules at the same time!
it can crash the system.
it must be a bug of i810_audio that can coexist with ALSA driver.

then VRA of ac97 seems not working correctly.
check /proc/asound/card0/codec97#0/* files for each case whether the
DAC rate is set correctly.  (it must be tuned with the detected ac97
clock, i.e. rate * clock / 48000).
