It's possible there may be something I'm not understanding. I do recognize 
that the license has a version number on it.

But then again, so did GPLv1. And it also had the same section 9 clause.

So the question is - why would the GPL need a clause that says "You can 
use any version of the GPL if the Program does not specify a version" when 
every official version of the GPL includes a version number? Are they 
expecting authors to strip the version number header in order to somehow 
take advantage of section 9?
