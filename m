hi everyone. [all done for fun]

I compiled 2.2.19 with the -O3 flag. then benched with
crafty (chess engine) and it peformed faster in that
respect.

I would like to ask when compiling with -O3 flag on a
kernel such as 2.2.19, what harm / side effect will I
feel later on if any? will i loose speed in other area's?
