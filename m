Thats like saying "turn up the radio" when your car makes a funny noise, 
or "if a tree falls in the woods and nobody is there to hear it, does it 
make a sound?"

It's tempting and comforting to pick the good ones as an example, and 
some bugs are hard enough to find, let alone fix.  In the end though, if 
one is broke, it's still broke, isn't it?
