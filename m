Because it is evidently confusing the issue. Perhaps because it sounds like 
you were intending to feed Linus large patches for 2.5.[12] which effect 
_both_ changes.

Have patience - let the less contentious part of CML2 go in first, and then
we can deal with the other stuff later, once CML2 has been accepted (however
grudgingly in some cases) by developers.

For a man who claims to hack social systems, that's an incredibly naïve 
question.
