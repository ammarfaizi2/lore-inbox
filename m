Today SUN announced the availability of Solaris 9. It has a lot
Linux compatibility features: ;-)

>From the announcement:

In today's world of heterogeneous computing, compatibility leads 
to efficiency. Combining the Linux community with thousands of 
Solaris software developers and nearly three million Java and XML 
software developers, Sun provides customers with unified access to 
the broadest array of innovation in the industry on which to provide 
services. In the Solaris 9 Operating Environment, more Linux applications, 
tools, and APIs are made available.

API Compatibility

Common libraries and build environments, such as libxml, glib, and GTK+, 
are integrated in the Solaris Operating Environment to streamline source 
code development across Linux and Solaris environments.

Application Compatibility

Common Linux applications, such as Samba, Apache, Linux (GNU) commands, 
etc., are included in the Solaris 9 Operating Environment. The Solaris 
Software Companion CD has an even more comprehensive set of free software.
     
On my web site I posted a little article about Solaris 9:
