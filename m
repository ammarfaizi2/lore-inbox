I think this is a fantastic and useful project.
However it is unfortunate that currently results are only available  
for >=2.6.9.
(If only somebody had been brilliant enough to start this in 2000!!!)

How long does the test suite take to run?
Are there plans to test previous versions?

I suppose that a baseline of 2.4.xx would be interesting, and also  
all releases back to 2.6.0

Also, is there any benefit in expanding the range of systems?
ie low end kit, different processor architectures etc.

Or is the primary purpose served well by using a small, modern group  
of test machines?
