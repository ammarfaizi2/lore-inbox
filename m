Alan, actually here in the States #2 is pretty easy to call. BTW, IANAL,
just have had to take law classes for various classes. The law here
clearly states that a contract is two parties exchanging things of
value.

Some text book examples of contracts include one parties
"consideration" (thing of value) may be refraining from exercising a
right/privilege they have.

Of course, anyone who is willing to give up rights indefinitely for a
small some of money or a small benefit is a fool, but hey.

Now of course, if they say "hey, I have this awesome change to this GPL
program, I will share it with you but only if you agree to not
distribute it is bogus. That violates the GPL on their part and revokes
their license.
