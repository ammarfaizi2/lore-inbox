Good Afternoon!  My name is John Carter, Technical Recruiter with Hollister
Associates Contract IT/Software Division in Boston, Ma.  We currently deal
with Top Tier Software and Development as well as Brick and Mortar Companies
in Boston and New England area.

I presently have an opportunity for a Linux/SCSI Driver Developer that may
be of interest to you. 

If you are interested in learning more about this project, or future
engagements which will continue to sharpen your skills, you can contact me
anytime.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Be the technical lead for a small team of 4 engineers to design and develop
a Fault Tolerant version of Linux on Stratus Fault Tolerant IA32
architecture. This project will include the porting of Linux to Stratus FT
hardware, kernel support for CPU and memory synchronization, the addition of
hot-plug PCI support, and a device memory protection scheme. Position
involves design, development of code, participation in strategic product
definition and customer presentations. 
Experience 5 or more years of software development experience. Linux kernel
and/or device driver experience highly desirable or UNIX kernel experience a
must. All coding will be in C/C++.

Position is in Maynard, MA
