AFAIU, if Linus (or whoever) puts out a -preX, it is because according to
_their_ testing (limited, whatever) it is "almost done, please check". If
they put out a non-pre, it is because they don't see any more issues with
it. The _only_ way they can ever know something breaks is that _somebody_
(yes, I _do_ mean you) checks it out and complains beforehand.

Want to have Linux for a free ride? Sorry, pal, no deal. You can use it in
exchange for testing and bug reports. Better yet, patches.
