That's your personal opinion! A lot other people (including me) have had 
excellent experience with binary drivers!

The day you show me that the open-source driver is faster and more 
stable then the binary driver, I'll switch. But until then I'll stay 
with my binary driver. I haven't had any serious problems with it, in 
fact, I'm very happy, so why should I want to switch?

I don't see Linux in such a political way like some of you do, for me 
Linux is just like any other OS. There are good drivers and bad drivers. 
And I don't care if they are open source or binary, I don't judge them 
based on that, but based on how well they work and how good the support is.

Most end-users will never get directly in touch with the kernel 
developers. They'll first go to their distribution. Most Ubuntu users 
don't even know what a kernel is (not that I use Ubuntu, but it's a 
distribution that is widespread among the less experienced end-users and 
people who switch to Linux from the windows world).
