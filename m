Absolutely.

Like it or not, I personally use BK. I don't use CVS, and I don't use 
subversion. 

If anybody wants to maintain his own kernel, feel free to remove the 
documentation on how to interact with _me_. In such a kernel, those docs 
would obviously be meaningless. 

In fact, Daniel, if you had bothered to just even grep for CVS, you would 
have noticed that we've had CVS information for some other subprojects 
too, because _they_ happen to use CVS. Would you argue for removal of the 
CVS information in Documentation/filesystems/jfs.txt file?

And if not, then you're a hypocritical bastard with a religious agenda.
