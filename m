Hmm. Thank you, Knuth.

They also need to understand large parts of security, and system API
design.

I disagree. This is equivalent to saying, once I am an archetect, it is
easy for me to build houses. Tools and practices take incredible amounts
of time to master. Languages take years, and learning the
non-algorithmic parts of hacking, like techniques for keeping namespaces
clean, or designing APIs to be extensible, or just tracking code; all
these are time devouring.

But, ultimately, computers are procedural. FP helps /prove/ algorithms,
but it is a terible way to actually run them.
