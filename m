Yes, I seriously considered the feasibility of having 2.4.14-fixed
kernels around, but I could just imagine trying to deal with millions of
people trying to download known good kernels on our bandwidth...

It would be good to be able to point people to a stable kernel.. instead
of having to recommend kernels in the pre-series..

But for now, fixing the 2.4.14. loopback bug has given us a kernel we
are most comfortable with.. 

Just wish that 2.4.14 was that kernel..

There was however a general consensus that for small bugs that are found in a 'stable' release there should be fixes for just the bug as the next release.  I.E. 2.2.15 should be released with just the one fix.  Linus didn't seem to go for that as well as some other developers .
