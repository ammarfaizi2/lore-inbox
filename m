	It doesn't and he didn't say it did.  He said the ability to
ultilize another's style...  That is fundamentally different.

	I've been in this business since the mid '70s, on the Internet
since the mid '80s, and involved with Linux since the 0.98 and SLS days.
I've long recognized that you could often recognize who wrote something
by their "style".  It's like brush strokes on a painting.  If you can
utilize someone else's style to the extent that someone skilled would
look at that an think it was done by the other.  That is skill and that
is both ability and adaptibility.  Both admirable.
