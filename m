	Well thank you :) My argument is that there should be a 
way USING THE TOOL to determine which bugs are available to be 
worked on. Do you seriously want 2000 people emailing you privately 
asking if you are working on your bugs?	I suspect since this bugzilla 
is so brand new that there should be something the database people 
can do to facilitate this. 
	I agree there should be people making sure the bugs don't get 
ignored, but do they have to be assigned as owners? Could there 
be a hierarchical set up of subsystem maintainer contact and 
then actual bug owner?
