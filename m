Those developers who can use BitKeeper in their work, regardless if 
they paid for it or not.

Well that's for Larry to decide. I would hope that the benefits would 
be there for him.

Don't look a productivity gain in the mouth.

> Good thing for subversion developers? Definitely not.

In this case yes are you correct.  It's not good for them or for 
related technologies.  OTOH, you'll get no break from companies such as 
Microsoft. Wanna clone MS Word, well you're buying it to do that.  
Course generally there's the reverse engineering clause.

I do not understand in any way shape or form why you THINK it's 
reasonable for a company to give a competitor a leg up on putting them 
out of business. It's not.  While it is normal for open source projects 
to cross pollinate, this is not the case here.

BitKeeper is not open source software so you can't subject it to the 
same standards that you apply to Open source works.
