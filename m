I think I see now why you have been pursuing this issue like
a abused Pit Bull.  You perceive in the name 'Linux' an implicit
claim that what it denotes is entirely the work of Linus Torvalds.

There is no such implication in it.  As for interpretation,
Linux newbies don't even know that someone named 'Linus Torvalds'
exists, while Linux cognoscenti know perfectly well that
Linus Torvalds didn't write the whole thing.  That leaves the
semi-informed, i.e., journalists, but who cares what they
think?  There is no problem here.

                       IT'S JUST A NAME
