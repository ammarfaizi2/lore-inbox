I would have never signed up for this list, or any other if it didn't give me at
least a few hours worth of email bouncing neither myself, or usa.net is up
24/7/365, and i wouldn't expect that everyone has a dedicated email server, for
almost any list. plus I have had many problems with the @home's email servers,
if I relied on them I would probibly have been kicked off quite some time ago.

well thats my 2cents
