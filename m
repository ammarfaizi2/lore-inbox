Why not do it like the current Changelog, put it in the kernel repository, 
and make sure it hits all the mirrors. A little selective advertising (eg: 
someone mention it on slashdot, newsforge, debianplanet, etc), and people 
will start using it. Just suffix the file with the version number, just 
like the Changelog. Because the file will be small, it's possible that some 
mirrors will get quick updates before they get the kernel itself. This 
covers all the version specific problems at least.
