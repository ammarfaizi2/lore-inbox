But lwn.net has only reported it to its subscribers.  I'm not one of those and 
I don't indend to become one in predictable future.  I'm sorry, but I don't 
consider lwn.net as a publicly available source of information.

In fact, _you_ decided to speak of this _in_ _public_, so please give away at 
least _some_ information that _you_ have or a link that is available to _the_ 
_public_.

Yours,
