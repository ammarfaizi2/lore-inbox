Ok, just filled out a request form on their site, asking them who the best person for us to contact is.

Hello,

Is Broadcom interested in having support for their encryption acceleration products (not just the one given in the 
product number above) officially added to Linux?

The Linux "CryptoAPI" project is trying to find out the best person at Broadcom to contect, as we are adding support for 
encryption hardware to the Linux kernel and are wondering you guys would like your products included.

:-)

Regards and best wishes,

Justin Clift

Reckon we should probably hear something back within 3-4 days.  It's worded clearly enough for pretty much anyone there 
to understand, and gives them a solid "reason to contact us" back.

:-)

Does it sound ok?

Regards and best wishes,

Justin Clift
