I don't expect it to be a memory problem my system is really stable and 
the weirdest about the problem is that it only happens the first time I 
boot up after my pc has been turned off for a while and there are no 
problems when i boot 2.5.1 it only crashes on shutdowns on that kernel. 
I have tried updating all kind of things, but noting seems to work

Thanks for your reply
