Well it certainly looks as though they copied Linux. At least
they copied the comments okay. It also looks as though the
`evidence` was additionally tampered with because, what is
alleged to be appropriated code will not even compile because
of the tampering.

In the United States Courts, one cannot simply hand-copy some
so-called evidence. This so-called evidence will never make
it to court. If this is being used as evidence, this is prima-
facie evidence of fraud.

Don't do the editing for them. Just let them make their phony
evidence. If this continues, somebody will lose their license
to practice law, and sombody may even end up in jail.
