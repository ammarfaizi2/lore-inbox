Subject: kernel freeze on 2.4.0.prerelease
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

On all kernels newer than 2.4.0t13p3 I have the following problem.

shorly after boot (some seconds) the system freeze. I can only swith consoles
but i am not able to login. Over the net I get onyl responses to
pings nothing else.

Up to kernel 2.4.0.t13p3 everythings works fine.

Sorry for this simple description, but I am not able to get more clear infos.
No oops, nothing in the logs after reboot with 240t13p3.

Perhaps someone has an idea where to dig?
