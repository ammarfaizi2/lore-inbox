With leds.c, that's 13 lines down and only 5982412 more to go at my 
count.  At a rate of one per day it'll only take him 1260 years to 
finish his acquisition (dependent on 63 more US copyright extension acts 
of course).  It'll also take 920 thousand beers, though Germans might 
demand a better rate than 54ml per line of code (2 * 12 US fluid oz / 13 
lines).

In all seriousness, this is all pretty obvious given SCO's past actions 
to inflate their stock.  Jeff wants us to remove the code in a "good 
faith effort", and then SCO would simply turn around and say "See, the 
Linux people are acting guilty by removing all that code!  We need past 
damages now!".  Anything you do, or do not do, is spun by them as an 
admission.  Even the press has tired of this by now, thankfully.  Jeff 
it seems, has not.

Now if only we could get him to leave us alone for 1260 years...
