Much as I disagree with Stallman about nearly everything, and much as I agree
that his posts recently have been way off-topic, I cannot agree with such a
disgusting and unethical solution. Silencing one viewpoint simply because you
disagree with it is just ... well, I don't use that kind of language.
Many people have started offtopic threads here without anyone suggesting they
be blacklisted, so I can only assume the suggestion here is based on the content
and not just the general off-topic nature. Most free-speech advocates would 
find such a thing disgusting at best.
