For the FSF it's easy to change the copyright in their software since 
they have copyright assignments for all software contributed.

There are _many_ people that have a copyright on parts of the Linux
kernel (the exact number might be different in different countries due
to different copyright laws). To change the copyright to anything other
than GPL v2 is practically impossible (even if a new version of the GPL
might fix the deficits you mentioned).
