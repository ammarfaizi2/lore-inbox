Let's talk about a specific example: we (DENX) published a patch  for
RTAI  and RTLinux to support the MPC8xx Embedded PowerPC controllers.
The patch has been on our FTP server since May 12,  2001.  One  month
latyer,  FSMLabs announced support for the MPC8xx in their commercial
version of RTLinux. Until today they only offer 8xx support in  their
commercial version, but not in the GPLed version.

Now tell me again who wants to make money off who's work?
