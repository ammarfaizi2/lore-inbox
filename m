It strikes me that this thread isn't really about binary-only drivers
and that whole ugly discussion. What it's really about is getting
third party drivers to work with Linux more easily. That conversation
does involve the "out of tree vs. upstream" question, but mention of
binary-only drivers actually only serves to cloud the real issue here.
