Hi Gerd,
Hi lkml,

I reported big problems with bttv on my machine
some time ago. It didn't work and locked up my machine.
Now with test7 it works fine (no crashes until yet), but I still
get lots of warning/error messages from the bttv driver.
Here are todays messages:

I'm using a preemptible kernel.
Should I try it again with preemptible disabled?
Could you point me to some other things to try, to track down
this bug?

I'm using a Hauppauge WinTV PCI with bttv878 chip and tvtime
as tv-application.
