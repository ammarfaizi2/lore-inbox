RTLinuxFree 3.2-pre1 released. 
This release is a pre-release for RTLinuxFree 3.2. but is considered
stable. It contains more than a year worth of contributions from 
us and others.

 RTLinuxFree 3.2 is available at
	http://www2.fsmlabs.com/3.2-free.html  
 
Timings with Linux 2.4.18 on a P4 are about 16 microseconds
worst case error for a 1 millisecond periodic task. 
K7s are really good too.
You can expect 30-40 microseconds on earlier machines.
