Hi,

I have an idea for next kernels stables.

Before pre´s releases a release -rc it would have the paper of final test, 
not to have problem of a stable version to leave with problems.

The finality of -rc release it would be only test, and any alteration 
would be created new - rc.

As knows some people place the steady versions in its systems without if 
worrying about instability of it.

But an idea.

Regards,
