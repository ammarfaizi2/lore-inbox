hey andrew, i am using 2.6.7-mm4, and i have some severe net problems.

as discussed earlier, the http behavior is strange, however those 2
sysctl lines fixes it mostly, but still, my net is awful slow, i should
have my connection upgraded to 2mbit, and i thought they did not do it,
but then i find out that it is my linux that has a problem. i can only
download with 40kb/s, and on a windows machine 200kb/s easily..

i would like to know what causes it, and how to fix :)

thanks
