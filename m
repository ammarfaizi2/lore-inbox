Hi all

I apologize if this is a well-known error, but after searching all
archives I can think of, including google, I still can't find anything but
questions.

Version: linux-2.4.17+Tux2.4.17a0+rmap11c+ide2.4.17.01192002

Problem is:

I start the client, boot from PXE with PXELinux. The config file has one
line:

DEFAULT linux-2.4.17pronto1 root=/dev/nfs \
nfsroot=192.168.144.247:/client-root,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,nfsvers=3 \
console=ttyS0,38400

When booting up, I get the following messages:

Does anyone know what's going on? I can mount anything I want from other
computers, or from the one in question as well, if booting up on a hard
drive or floppy.
