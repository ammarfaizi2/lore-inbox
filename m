> Yes, the LSM licensing issue seems to be critical to a lot of people :)

I read the current evolvement of the LSM framework and its ongoing
licensing discussions with great affection and joy :) This is what
happens if too many third party vendors get interested in yet another
possiblity of selling their product under Linux legally ...

Ok. I thought it had to be GPL anyway but then again I'm not too
familiar with the whole LSM "patch" yet. It seems as if there are
multiple licenses needed. [Well, that's what we have the MODULE_LICENSE
for then.]

I put their license on the page too. Enjoy the binary software license:
