Maintaining device registration and persistence all from userspace is
wonderful.  Try it, you'll like it.  Not to mention that for the
developers udev is much more easily maintained than kernel code
(devfs).  Your concern about something else ripping off udev a year
from now is misplaced; the beauty of free software is the best
solution generally wins out.  That "something else" will have to be
pretty damn amazing to upstage udev.
