Stuart, FYI, more linux-kernel ettiquite.

People much prefer to see a quoting style as above (date, from line,
inline >-delimited note you're quoting, followed by non->-delimited
text.  (Such as this).  Outlook doesn't do this very well, as it
always wants to put your response at the top of the message, but with
cut-n-paste you can make the messages look more like what l-k expects.

Thanks,
Matt
