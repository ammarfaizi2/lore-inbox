Stop lying. Your job is to make lots of money and you are using Linux
as cheap advertising. You are trying to make people pay *you* to do
kernel development (as it stands you want $5000 for any bk-using
developer inside RedHat and SuSE).

I hope your company dies ASAP and bitkeeper stops poisoning air here.
