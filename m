Well OK, but whether the manufacturers are bad or good, there will be
some that aren't going to release specs or open source drivers. I think
it is *mostly* positive that the Linux kernel allows them to support
Linux though binary drivers.

Note, I'm talking about the kernel. We are all agreed that closed specs
are a bad move by manufacturers.
