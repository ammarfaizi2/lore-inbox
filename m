Sounds great, but _every single time_ I've ever gotten one of those
"your message is awaiting moderation" messages from such a list, it's
inevitably followed a few hours/days later by a "your message has been
rejected" message.  In every case, the message I sent was definitely a
no-brainer to allow, so I can only guess that either the moderation
system is broken, or the moderators are.

Are there actually any lists out there where this mechanism works properly?

As it is, it's even more annoying than an immediate rejection.
