Hello,

looks like my previous Bug-Report has been somewhat unspecific. So here is a
version which has the form suggested in the REPORTING-BUGS documentation.

[1.] reproduceable 2.4.21 NFS client Freeze

[2.] When an NFS Volume mounted from a Windows 2000 Machine (Hummingbird NFS
     Maestro Server, Version unknown) is accessed using something like "ls
     /mountpoint" the machine freezes immediately. The state is not
     completely frozen, but a state where anything but ICMP-echo responces
     seem to be frozen.

[3.] Kernelmode NFS client

[4.] Linux version 2.4.21 (root@neptun)
     (gcc version 2.95.4 20011002 (Debian prerelease))
     #1 Mon Jun 16 13:43:25 CEST 2003
     This is a vanilla Kernel!

[5.] There is no oops

[6.] a simple "ls /mountpoint" triggers the Problem. Here is what the Kernel
     reports with rpc_debug and nfs_debug enabled in between the time the
     "ls /mountpoint" is started and the freeze:

[7.] Environment

This is just one machine I randomly picked, but the Problem exists on any
machine we are running 2.4.21 on! The Problem does not exist with 2.4.20.

[7.3.] This machine is using a monolithic Kernel


[8.] The bug is not specific to one particular machine, but see attached
.config of the machine I picked.
