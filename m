Agreed. I did a lot of testing and some grunt-level coding on CML2, and
I think it addressed a lot of problems that existed, and was getting
steadily better. Sure, it had some flaky spots, but I really don't see
all of the problems that people had with it. Even autoconfig had this
tendency to do the Right Thing. I think it was just about ready to start
getting some wide testing and use, when everyone abandoned it... And now
nobody wants to use it, because of course patches don't play nice with
it, and etc... Pretty sad.

Oh well.
