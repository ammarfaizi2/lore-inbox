Would you like, David, explain why my messages sometimes go to /dev/null?
Last one was <http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.test/3360>, while
previous message with same headers and e-mail was ok. And this
was dropped even via gmane.org nntp posting, as well as with lkml in cc.

Thanks.

While using gmane.org news is very nice to read, i have problems with
adding lkml in cc list, when i post. That is because gmane is replacing
"newsgroup" header with "To" one, and my news user agent is replacing "Cc"
with "To", and not add lkml to it, when sending copies my e-mail.
So, i add "Mail-Followup-To", "Reply-to" is taboo on vger.kernel.org,
and former is not supported by popular MUAs ;\

Maybe a should hack my news client to do some magic with this, don't
know yet.
