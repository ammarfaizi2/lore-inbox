Eh? It is perfectly okay to look at BK's
commands, ask people how BK works
and study its docs. (Heh, anyone still
has sources of BK from the time it was
available, preferably as hardcopy,
so no license needs to be agreed to
for looking at it?)

So go ahead and disallow no-price use of
bitkeeper. It will reduce flamewars on
l-k quite a bit...
