Oh no. My opinion points exactly 180 degrees to the other side.
You can't say: "The whole community is evil" if only a few people are.
And IMHO that are only a _few_ people.
I think most people of the opensource community know exactly about
copyrights and so on and don't violate them.

But: They don't illegaly steal bk. They make their own software for
which _they_ own the copyright. I think it is their good right to do so.

I see no problem here.
But in the future software patents will prevent it :P
