To be precise, it has more than one.

When you hit an OOPS, the trace [1] might show:
"Pid: 0, comm: swapper Not tainted 2.6.11.6"

Plus you see one of these per CPU [ps aufwwx]:
root       106  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    Apr20   0:04 [kswapd0]

So, a question to the public: what swapper swaps, and what's swapper(as in 
pid 0) in oops, if there's no PID 0?

Is your code doing it like ipt_owner does?
