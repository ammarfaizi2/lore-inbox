	That is entirely up to the posters to post to that list.
	If you look at:
		http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html

	you will notice that   linux-kernel-announce  list actually exists,
	and has 434 subscribers (or had when the HTML page was generated
	less than 24 hours ago... -- it is generated once a day.)

	So, announcements are thus requested to be posted ALSO
	to    linux-kernel-announce at vger.kernel.org
