Yes, its awesome! And I would like to thank Analog Devices for doing=20
and sponsoring this work. I also like to thank them for providing useful
test devices for reasonable prices. Hope you guys will make it.

I have seen a presentation and demo of this on the Chemnitzer Linux Tage 20=
06[1]
and was impressed big time considering how long it took to get sth. running
with other products and without any vendor Linux support.

And yes I'm a bit biased[2], as you'll find out, if you google a bit :-)
