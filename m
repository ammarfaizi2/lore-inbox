But we're talking about linux ... and we're talking about profit, not
revenue. I'd guess that 99% of their desktop sales are for Windows. 
And I'd guess they make 100 times as much profit on a big server as they 
do on a desktop PC. 

Would be nice if someone had real numbers, but I doubt they're published
except in non-free corporate research reports.
