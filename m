Um, I have to. What I was trying to is to get a clear answer, why he does 
not want a different license. All arguments I heard so far don't speak 
against a libgcc like license. I only want to know whether there is an 
alternative solution he might also be comfortable with.
I don't want to pressure him into anything, I only sort of expect, if 
someone makes a decision, which might have farreaching consequences, that 
he is able to explain and defend his decision. All I want is that people 
sometimes think what consequences their action might have. This is the 
point I'm missing here a bit.

bye, Roman
