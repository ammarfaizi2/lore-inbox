Steve,

Here's the second part of the patch for smberr.h. This one break up the 
long comments. Applies on top of the previous one.

Patch is also available from 
http://www.linuxtux.org/~juhl/kernel_patches/fs_cifs_smberr-whitespace-2.patch


Break comment lines so they all fit on a 80 column display.
