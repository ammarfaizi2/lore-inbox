Um, i hate to be a dick, but:

Does this look like a windows XP mailing list to you? Call Microsoft 
support.

Sounds like your software/OS is deficient (in more ways than one).

I've got an idea. Stop using a playskool operating system where you need 
something industrial-grade. Hey, this is a Linux-related mailing list: 
Why not install some version of Linux instead?

To make it short and sweet, you're using a screwdriver where you need a 
hammer. Sure, if you beat on it enough, you *might* be able to get 
something half-assed working, but don't start crying when it falls 
apart. Most importantly, this discussion is *grossly* off-topic for this 
list
