What do you mean "see bad sectors"?

Modern drives are trying to relocate sectors that can become bad in short 
time. But this does not work 100% reliably. And sometimes disk wants to 
relocate sector but the sector can not be read anymore. If this happens 
disk will return read error when reading the sector _but_ when you will 
write it again it will relocate it (with new data). And I think this was 
the idea behind first post... To allow disk A to relocate not readable 
sectors with correct data from disk B.
