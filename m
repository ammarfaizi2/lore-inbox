Dear Sir , 
My name is Mr. Fudah Sanko the rebel leader in Sierra-Leone. You might have heard my problems with the Sierra-Leone present regime. 
If you wish to hear more, you can listen to BBC network Africa that is where you can follow my case up with Justice Harmoty who is planning to condemn me during the finalprosecution or trial. Our problem in Africa is that no President will like to relinquish power to another person of another party unless by violence or struggle which must emenate forcefully. 
I arranged with my wife and wrote this mail during her visit to me with a small laptop computer. My wife got your contact through the GOOGLE website and brought it to me, after reading your profile she chooses you. Incase government decide to kill me, please for further existence of my family, I kept the sum of$20.5m which I intend to use for importation of arms and ammunitions, also I kept some reasonable quantity of diamond in safe place which my LAWYER know about it before my problem arises.Presently, my LAWYER is in position of the fund and
diamond, also i told him not to keep this morney with our family
name,for security reasons. As a matter of urgency contact him on his e-mail address: david.nkosi@lawyer.com OR davidnkosi@mail.co.za arrange with him on how you will receive the fund and invest it in your
country for further existence of my family. 
Please make sure you give my son resident permit in your country. My son may like to move with my wife if they kill me. Don't fail to help my family for God sake. For your information, the fund has moved out of Sierra-Leone for security reasons.Contact my LAWYER for immediate actions. My LAWYER'S name is Mr. DAVID NKOSI.my son email address
is:ibudu.sanko@email.it


Best regards, 


Mr. Fudah Sanko
