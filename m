I've commented on this already.

Yeah, I need to deliberately damage one block in order to test the firmware,
but I don't want to damage multiple blocks and use up the reallocation
space.  I am a home user, even if I also do programming at work, even if I
also volunteer one day each weekend to test Linux.  How can I arrange to
damage one block on a disk?

I'm not sure how many Dell notebooks you'll have to open to see a Toshiba
drive, but I'll bet the number is low.  Also do you recognize the name
Toshiba as a large maker of notebook PCs, and do you have any guesses as to
how many Toshiba notebooks you'll have to open to see a Toshiba drive?
Toshiba already reduced their former US 3-year warranties to 1 year and
provide 0 warranty directly to customers in Japan.  (Maybe they should
follow the ideas of a certain dominant software maker and pretend to have a
90-day warranty but in fact renege every time a failure occurs?  There would
be 0 difference in what needs to be done in software to make up for it.)
