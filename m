Hey, come on, this is a legitimate question.
It's been a bit "uninformed", yes, but that's not really an excuse for making
such comments ;-)
Furthermore you posted this with a Windoze client (outlock), so it's even
less of an excuse :)

To the original poster:
I'm not really authoritative on driver submission, but I'd read the file
/usr/src/linux/SubmittingDrivers for info on how to do that, if I were you.

New VIA drivers are very good for Linux anyway ! :-)
(thanks !)
