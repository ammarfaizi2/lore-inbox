I do appologize. I didn't realize pine would do this. In pine I can just
read the attachment as text and in Eudora it just appears as inlined
text without any indication of it being a separate attachment, so I just
assumed that it was sent clear text. Obviously not. <Stupid mailers. Grr.>

I will repost as soon as I manage to convince pine of it's wrong ways...

Best regards,
