Because they contain phrases that are not understood. Sometimes
they also contain phrases which trigger concerned responses
even when that isnt appropriate. I've for example been tweaking
some messages so it is clear that the problem the kernel found
it also fixed.

People find the PC boot intimidating (ask PC support people about
people who call in 'lost in the cosmos' and other such gems). Thats
why the PC boot has often gone graphical.
