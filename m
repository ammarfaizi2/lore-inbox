Of course.  It's naturally understandable that they don't rebel, but
that's the case, at least.  Democratic society did not spring overnight.
It was hard won through centuries of standing up against 'the people
with guns,' even if the people with guns had swords, bows and arrows,
cannons, rifles, etc., instead.

Again, see above.  Others have managed it.  No one is saying its easy,
only possible.

And again, I don't hold the fact that the unarmed Afghans don't rebel
against them.  As I said it's completely understandable.  I don't think
they deserve to be killed.  I'm only saying that a good argument can be
made that they are completely responsible for their government, directly
or indirectly.
