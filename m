I am not finding the correct way to have my std keyboard
recognized and usable under 2.5.3-dj3.  I am assuming that
I am missing some config options.  I have set to built-in
all the keyboard looking options in the new input section,
but still no keyboard recognition, the keyboard acts like
it isn't even connected on boot, the num-lock doesn't even
toggle the led, ctrl-alt-del doesn't shutdown.  What am I
missing?

Thanks,
