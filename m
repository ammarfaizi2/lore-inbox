Webster says (but what did he know), that "disc" is an abbreviation
for "discount", a variation of "disk", or a "phonograph record".

Disk is even more obscure, It relates to plowing and harrowing.
However buried in the text is a reference to "round flat plate coated
with a magnetic substance upon which data for a computer is stored"

Disque isn't listed, and the French Security Police had it
exterminated from the language when it started to show up on
boxes of "disquettes". Last I heard, their 'Disk' is roughly-
translated to "train in a box".

So, we should call them paradigms ;^.
