These companies you mention make enormous profit margins as a result of
'protectionist laws', illegal business practices, and other non-ethical
means (to varying degrees).  They spend large sums of money to buy
politicians to slant the playing field in their favor.  The list goes
on...

As a general rule of thumb any corporation that is worth billions of
dollars got there by exploiting a lot of somebodies along the way.

I question the ethics and motivation of anyone who does something to
"get rich".  As opposed to someone who does something to benefit
themselves and others and (due to the structure of modern society) make
a comfortable living.

I am no Stallman fan but it is fair to say that much regarding
copyright, patent law (and especially the USPTO), and other
"intellectual property" law/practice is broken.  These things were
broken by those motivated by the desire to "get rich".

P.S.  I am and have been self-employed the majority of my adult life.
