Well, you can get a large CF flash disk or IBM micro-driver, or you
can mount a disk over NFS, if you're concerned about disk space.  However,
it probably wouldn't be a whole lot of fun to cross-compile and
figure out how to install X, regardless of where you store it,
so a netwinder might be best if you can find one...
