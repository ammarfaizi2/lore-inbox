I just fired it up an an Asus P4B533-V (845G-Award Medallion Bios
v6.0) 
board. Seemed to work well  :) . Full DMA on the DVD drive.
 
I took a gamble to see if my old "non-appearing" drives
problem was fixed, and tried it on the Gigabyte 845IGX
(845G-Award Modular Bios V6.0PG),  I was not
as lucky. I think my next board will be an Asus. ;)

Full dmesg, lscpi links below, for anyone who is interested.
Let me know if you need anymore info.

Thanks!

Tony
