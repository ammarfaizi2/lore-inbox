What about section 2, subsection B of the GPL:

"this License", would refer to the specific version of the license.  
This means
that since the original code is dual-licensed under both versions, any 
code
that is a derivative work must _also_ be dual-licensed (This assumes of
course that the other license has a similar clause).  In any case, any 
work
derived from a GPLv2'ed work must also be licensable under the GPLv2.
Therefore, my request for _your_ source-code under the GPLv2 is 
perfectly
valid.
