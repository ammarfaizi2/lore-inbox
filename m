Hi Jeff,

As I am since now in holidays I could not do this before July, 30. (I 
don't have this chipset here, only at work.)
But if someone gets on with it, any information is greatly appreciated.
If nobody gets on, I will try on/after July, 30.

greetings from hot south-east germany :)

         Lars
