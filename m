Matthew, thanks for your abuse.  It was not necessary.

As a programmer, it is essential that I, like others, have a
reasonable understanding of the GPL.  It is not written only for
lawyers.  I did not nitpick something esoteric; I nitpicked something
which is important to real people who deal in GPL software which is
not available to the public.

Because this thread kept using the past tense to say what crossmeta
_have_ done.  As it's still available, why mention 'third parties'?
They're irrelevant; the violation is quite straightforward.

Because he wrote something that, _without context_, is a technical
mistake that people sometimes make when talking about the GPL.  Like
you, I consider it my duty to ensure the GPL is upheld, and in the
proper way.  I appreciate now that Harald understands it well and his
statement was a simplification; others, may not.  I've been writing
GPL software for 15 years; it's not a new thing to me.

Please understand that I didn't receive these messages through a
legal-experts list, where of course I would be far more cautious to
comment; I received them on a software development list.

That's correct.  I did not realise that.  That's great!  But I haven't
known Harald's name before; and also did not know this thread had
reached the point of someone actually handling the legal end.
