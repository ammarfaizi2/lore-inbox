Eric,

Good news: I have tried your patchset on a 2-way system, and kexec
worked.

Mixed news: I didn't get any console output after the last printk in
kexec ("Starting new kernel"), nor did I get any console output during
the reboot.  Other than that, the system rebooted fine and went
multi-user (complete with graphical login and networking).  Strange.

I've got two other systems to test this on, and I'll report when I have
results. I have attached my .config and lspci output for the system I
used.

I have also loaded your patch set into OSDL's on-line patch manager. 
The patch stack I used can be found here:

APIC changes:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1842

i8259 changes:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1843

reboot on BSP:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1844

hwfixes & x86kexec:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1845

For the lazy among us, I have also uploaded a combined patch for 2.5.69
that includes the four previous patches in one:
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=1846

Regards,
Andy
