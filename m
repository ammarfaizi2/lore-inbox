Fix it first. The "merge as it stands" just gives rise to stuff that is
/never/ fixed properly.

Then test it out of the standard tree...

Urgh.

What is atomic that isn't in the standard filesystems? How do you guarantee
it doesn't stop the system dead in its tracks waiting for some very long
transaction to finish?

Usefulness? Sounds like kernel bloat leading to userspace bloat and
applications/users wondering what the heck goes on when they don't grok the
particular stat format.

I don't see anything that would interest me at least, so you can safely
scratch the "general interest" part.

That is a quite strong argument /against/ it all in my book. It means bloat
in /every/ filesystem, and they have shown to be able to do without for
some 30 years now. I'd need /very/ strong reasons for adding something.

Reiser4-only stuff is of very limited use, if it isn't just internal
stuff. And that doesn't need any changes.

It has been argued over and over that that particular feature /can't/ be
implemented sanely anyway, so it has to stay out. Besides not making any
sense. "You've got files and directories" is a bit asymetrical and so not
quite nice; "all you have is directories" is symmetrical, estetic, and
completely useless; "some files are directories, some aren't; files in
file-directories are different than regular files in directory-directories"
is just a mindless jumble.

Another good reason to keep it out ;-)
