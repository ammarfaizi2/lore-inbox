Hi all,

	An InfiniBand S/W project has been open on sourceforge.net
http://sourceforge.net/projects/infiniband.

	The site contains early reference code for an
	             InfiniBand Transport and OS infrastructure 
	             Virtual NIC Driver
	              IP LAN emulation driver that runs over InfiniBand
	              SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) driver
	              VIPL

	The project  intends to develop a production ready InfiniBand S/W
stack (using the existing code as a reference)
	and solicits participation from all interested parties in industry
and the Linux community at large.  The goal of the project
	is to produce an InfiniBand S/W OS infrastructure worthy of
inclusion in standard Linux distributions. 

	Refer to the Home Page on the SourceForge project for project
descriptions, details, and a list of contacts.
