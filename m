Hi,
Question: If I download and install the Nvidia graphics card drivers from 
their site, am I violating the GPL as an end-user?  I was thinking the the 
GPL mainly covered what you are allowed or not allowed to do if you 
distribute software.  I ask because I saw on the OpenSuse site a statement to 
the effect that OpenSuse would not ship Nvidia, Ati drivers because some 
kernel developers consider them a violation of their copyrights.

Thank you.
