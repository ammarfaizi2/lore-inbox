=46rom what I gathered, people were irritated because Dell only supplied a
patch of what modifications they had made, against a known RedHat
kernel.

IANAL, but I think they have matched what the GPL required them to by
doing so. There is a relatively easy way to recreate exactly what they
did. A correctly worded request to the right place inside Dell should
perhaps even yield the SPM they used.

It was not clear, but it appeared that the source was not asked for.
There was a whole lot of complaining that it wasn't distributed without
being asked for though.

It is interesting, but it would be nice to have a professional legal
opinion on the matter.
