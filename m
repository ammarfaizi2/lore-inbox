hi!

Congratulations for the 2.6 kernel, it seems more mature than 2.4 test kernels!
 
My 2.6 experience (linux-2.6.0-test4) is basically *very* good, but some remarks:

1) Documents/Changes should be updated to:

    module-init-tools      0.9.13                  # depmod -V

  Earlier module-init-tools do not work. at least nor for me.

2) latency problems:

  Allthough the new kernel feels snappier and faster in regard to mouse/keyboard/window
  handling, it has following problems:

  I have a cronjob every minute to pop/spamfiler/archive, so I have some IO on a regular
  basis. (The problem arises with any longer IO phase though).

  So during HD IO (ide/dma on) the mouse hangs, mouse buttons are not recognized.

  X11 is prio 15 / no nice level.

  Can you help me there? Do you need further information? (config attached)

3) I compiled a HOWTO/FAQ: <http://armin.emx.at/kernel_2.6/>

  Yeah it is yet another one, but I try to be more complete, and I'm willing to update.

  This is for 2.6 first timers, please testers look at it and share your experiences!

Thanks,
	Armin
