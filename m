Now that this fix have been written off as probably wrong; how much does 
it break? As far as I've understood it "just" reverts to old semantics, 
probably not correct semantics, but still not unexpected semantics 
(like, say, hang on device unregistration ;) )

I'm contemplating just using it as a quick-fix until 2.6.11 to get this 
problem under control.
