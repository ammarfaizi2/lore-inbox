Yes I like that, but does this measure "goodness of the test" or
something else? To make myself clear, let's look at some ridiculous
extreme condition. Your test really takes 1 second, but during your
tests there is a ping-flood that causes your test to take an hour.
Since the ping-flood is continuous, it smoothes out the noise of
your one-second test, making it 1/3600 of its true value. The
standard deviation looks very good but instead of showing that
your measurements were "good", it really shows that they are "bad".

I think a goodness-of-the-test indicator relates to the ratio of
the faster:slower tests. I don't know what you would call this, but
if your average was generated by 3 fast tests plus 1 slow test, it
would indicate a better "goodness" than 1 fast test and 3 slow ones.
It shows that external effects are not influencing the test results
as much with the "more-good" goodness.
