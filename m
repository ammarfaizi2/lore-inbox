Willy, I agree with almost every word.  I remember what happened to UseNet 
and some of the early mailing lists when they became over-run with 
commercial and self-serving messages (did someone say "kibo"?) and I don't 
envy David his job.

Bald prohibitions are easy and nasty.  Prohibitions with a steer in the 
right direction are just as easy, and comes across as more of a service to 
everyone.  How much better it would have been for David to have 
said  something with a positive twist:  "Don't do it here, do it at 
linux-jobs@vger.kernel.org" or some such.  (Assuming such a list exists -- 
and if there isn't such a list is it time to start one?)

As for sites and newsgroups, though, I have to take exception to your 
observation.  I have yet to find one that attracts both potential employers 
and potential employees and keeps its listings current.  The closest I have 
found to an active job list for Linux is Craig's List; sites such as 
www.hotlinuxjobs.com are not very up-to-date in the offerings -- every time 
I had tried to follow up on a listing from October 2002 to April 2003  I 
was told "that job's already filled."  The general-purpose jobs sites (Hot 
Jobs, Dice, America's Job Bank, and others) have some Linux jobs but 
usually as part of a package of jobs, not in isolation.

I'd appreciate specifics on good sites for Linux people, both from the 
perspective of an employer and a job seeker.
