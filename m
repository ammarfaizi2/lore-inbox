That's essentially what I said in <41DB2BF3.2010103@tmr.com>, and the 
only response I got questioned my mention that Alan Cox didn't think the 
process was working well. I suggested a fixed and shorter release 
schedule as well as point releases, but point releases are the more 
improtant, I believe.

I also said I didn't think it was going to change...
