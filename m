Jeff,

The BK documentation constitutes an implicit advertisement and 
endorsement of a product with a license which to many developers 
violates the spirit of open source software.  This is not to say that BK 
is not an effective product, nor that the document in question is useful 
for people who choose the tool, but to me it seems comparable to 
including a closed source binary module in the kernel distribution. 
 Moving the document to the BK website would be nicer, and would 
certainly assauge bad feelings regarding such an integral implicit 
endorsement of a tool.
