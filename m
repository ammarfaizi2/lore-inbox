Hi,
I need to know the system temperature for check some stability problems,
under 2.4 I was using lm_sensors patches, using i2c-viapro as i2c bus
and via686a as chip driver (I'm using a via 686 southbridge, see the
lspci output attached), and I was able to use sensors for see the
temperatures.
With the 2.6.0-test2 (and all earlier kernels since 2.5.69), I'm not
able anymore to see the temperature, nor with sensor (or libsensor
library) nor with sysfs (that, AFAIK, should be the new method to access
sensors data).
The only i2c device that I can see in the sysfs is the tuner of my
bt-based tv card.
I tried either with i2c-viapro and via686a as modules, and built-in in
kernel. Nothing	changes. Also dmesg doesn't output anything.
I have missed something?
