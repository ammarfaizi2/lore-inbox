I asked for a CC which is why I didn't see the reply until I looked in
Google groups and it is also why the thread will now be broken as I had
to cut and paste the reply as a new message.  Please CC me any replies.

Sorry, I thought it was obvious.  I'll requote:

>> The system doesn't recognise data or audio discs.

What I meant was that mounting fails with "no such device", and playing
audio CD's fails as well.  No error, just no recognition of the CD.

>> end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 0

I think that this is the problem, but I don't know what it means.  I
don't think posting the rest of my bootlog is patricularly helpful, but
please let me know if it is.  I am not passing any parameters to lilo.

I have attached my kernel config in the hope that the list doesn't strip
all attachments.
