Money is not a human work equivalent.  Money is a commodity that
everyone will barter with.  Making bartering more efficient.

With pure barter you have to do something like:
work -> stuff1 -> stuff2 ->stuff3 -> stuff you want.
With money this usually becomes
work -> money -> stuff you want.

This makes the assumption that all work is equally valuable.  But you
already made the assertion that a manager sitting around is not as
a miner.
