That's not possible, honestly. Any application of the adjectives "new" and
"well tested" to the same noun is an oxymoron.

If someone needs a new kernel they have to go to the bleeding edge,
otherwise what they need is an "upgrade," and it's not the same thing. By
the time a responsible vendor releases a kernel it is in no way new, nor
should it be.

Is you need stability and timelyness, go to vendors of -ac, -aa, -jam,
etc. Or similar, I'm not deliberately leaving anyone out, just that those
are kernels I have run on non-critical but production servers, because I
NEED the performance kick or the lockup fix.
