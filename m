Hah hah, very funny.
Observe me laughing...

There is hardly any reason to let opengroup.org domain machines to
post to linux -lists at vger.  Therefore to avoid genuinely off-topic
postings to our grand-daddy of all off-topic discussions, I have
blocked  opengroup.org  from posting to vger's lists.

I asked also for that   linux.kernel  account to be revoked.

Have a nice day,
