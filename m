Gene, this is not quite the right list for this discussion (have a
look at http://gpl-violations.org/) and your understanding of the GPL
is incorrect.

Just because a company doesn't have source freely downloadable on
their website does not mean they are violating the GPL even if they
are selling GPL licensed software. Only people who buy the GPL
licensed software are entitled to a copy of the source of the binaries
they receive.
