Uniform support from most of the hard- and software vendors on this
planet. Support for 50.000+ different hardware expansions with all
their features from grabber cards to color printers and network cards
to 3D graphics accelerators for their whole product line.

That's not innovation, you're correct. But that's 99% of what users
care about.

I still have no really well working Linux driver for the modem in my
notebook. And it is not even a WinModem. I have a 95% working
closed-source, binary only driver patched to my kernel version, which
at least for me is better than nothing.

Because it is cheaper to use. Linux has no license fee. That's what
the TiVO vendor cares about.
