Two machines, identical hardware (Dell 2450's, Dual PIII/667, 1gig ram).
One one, 2.4.14 boots and runs nicely, as one would expect.  On the other,
"as close to exact as I can imagine" compile configs, the machine reboots
just after LILO's "Loading Linux..."  Same version of LILO on both as well.

Has anyone else experienced this?  Any ideas on a fix?


Thanks,
  John
