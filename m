Creativity Courses in New York City and Europe

Hello,

My name is Vivian Glusman and I am the administrative associate of the
Creativity Workshop, taught by Master Teachers Shelley Berc and
Alejandro Fogel. I wanted to let you know about our upcoming workshops,
starting with our November 11 - 14 workshop in New York City and also
our NYC workshops in the spring and our summer workshops in Europe
(Crete, Provence, Florence, Barcelona, Prague and Dublin). We offer 3
university credits for the workshops in Europe.

Founded in 1993, the Creativity Workshop is dedicated to teaching people
about their creativity and how to use it in all aspects of life, work,
and creative expression. We do this through a series of exercises
developed by the founders and directors, Shelley Berc and Alejandro
Fogel. In a non-competitive, nurturing atmosphere, these workshops help
participants develop creative skills, expanded sense perception,
innovative problem solving, inspired brainstorming, and new ways of
looking at life as exciting and transformative. The price of the NYC
workshop is $600, tuition only. Our European workshop prices start at
$1,750 for tuition and 9 nights accommodations.

The only requirements for the Creativity Workshop are curiosity about
the creative process and a sense of playfulness.

See below calendar for the NYC workshops (non-credit) and the Europe
workshops (3 university credits available):

>From $1,750 including tuition and 9 night accommodations.

Whether you are in business, teaching, art, or science, our workshop can
help you discover and nurture your particular way of expression and
break through the fears and blocks that inhibit creative expression.
Working with thousands of individuals, businesses, and institutions
since 1993, the Creativity Workshop helps people believe in and develop
their imagination through using a unique series of exercises in memoir,
creative writing, visual arts, sense perception, brainstorming, and
storytelling. Our concentration is on the process of creativity rather
than the product. We emphasize the importance of play and the sharing of
ideas to nurture creative growth.

What people say about the Creativity Workshop:

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn their
dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how you can
do this through their challenging and inspiring creativity
workshops...even a simple first contact will prove what these two
talented teachers can do for your own gifts."
Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer, Professor
Singapore Management University.


"I have attended at least 10 creative seminars and this creativity
workshop is far above the others in its inspiration, positive spirit and
techniques for nurturing creativity. The Creativity Workshop changed me
forever and moved me forward in managing my creative companies, but more
importantly in my personal determination, commitment and creativity in
my own projects. This workshop is important for anyone who wants to
better understand, develop and celebrate their creativity in their
personal or business life."
Barbara Roberts, President and CEO
Acoustiguides, New York City

"I taught a creative writing class yesterday afternoon and felt a new
confidence after the summer's Creativity Workshop.  I was much more in
control and more confident of what I was doing and saying. My students
seem more excited about their work using your exercises. I feel that in
several months time I shall still be doing and saying things that echo
what we covered in your wonderful workshop."
Noel Shepherd, Creative Writing Teacher, grades 5 and 6
Washington International School

"Thank you for the great, great inspiration and fun of the Creativity
Workshop. It helped me get a whole screenplay done during a trip to
Mexico afterwards. It was great for me and my students. I don't think
I've ever seen them so happy."
Doris Doerrie, Filmmaker, Professor
Munich Film School, Germany

"This is my third workshop coming up and I can't wait! Shelley and
Alejandro ever so gently are able to get us fellow travelers (and not
students) in to a discovery mode that emerges us deep into the
experience of our very own creativity. You are magicians who invite us
to return to the best of our childhoods. Once there we recapture those
golden days of play and dream and fantasy."
Carroll Blue, Professor
School of Communications, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA

"Because I write for a living, I had forgotten how to write for fun. I
learned how to get to that "fun" part of writing again at this workshop."
Amy White, VP Internal Corporate Communications
Cardinal Health, Worthington, OH

"The workshop was incredible. The exercises and your encouragement were
wonderful. But, more importantly, your sensitivity and perceptivity in
regard to others and the human condition is unbelievable. I wish I knew
10 more of you!"
Neil H. Schwartz, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology
California State University, Chico

"Too often in the workplace, a fear of being judged, of "failure," or of
appearing "foolish" to others stifles our most creative thinking. The
Creativity Workshop showed me how to first examine, then overcome my
personal insecurities so that I am contributing with more freedom,
boldness and confidence than ever before."
Barbara Bazaldua, Director of Editorial
Disney Consumer Products, Anaheim, CA

Founded and directed by Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel in 1993, the
Creativity Workshop has been taught by them at educational, corporate,
