Yes, it is in linux-2.6.12-rc6, but also "[CPUFREQ] ondemand governor 
automatic downscaling" which back off this change because it introduce a 
new algorithm which compute automatically this step to the best value.

The cpufreq tree was going during three months separatetly and then all 
the commits went inside the Linus's tree at once. It might look strange 
then, but nothing to worry :-)

That's what you should see, everything is ok :-)

I think it's completetly unrelated. Probably it's better to discuss 
about this bug on the cpufreq mailing list: cpufreq@lists.linux.org.uk
