Subject: Bug in chipset or feature in kernel?
Cc: plr@udgaard.com
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Is the below described problem a problem with my chipset, the memory subsystem 
in the kernel, a combination of those or something entirely different?

Is there any test I should perform to investigate further eg. to find a 
workaround for a chipset limitation, if that is the problem? It looks as if 
there is a tuning for max. performance around 128MB. Coincidence?

I find it disturbing that adding more RAM decreases performance of the
system in this way, and maximum RAM giving the worst performance :-)
I don't suppose a kernel compile is such a terrible performance benchmark?

Below I have attached my problem report. I am not on linux-kernel, I'm reading
Kernel Traffic, so a cc: to me would be appreciated.

Thank you very much,

Peter

--- 
I have (an old) VIA chipset, Host bridge VT82C598 [Apollo MVP3] (rev 04),
and I have done some tests that show a non constant speed when compiling a
Linux kernel when increasing the amount of RAM the kernel is able to use. The
RAM is adjusted in lilo.conf and /proc/meminfo confirms it. A reboot is done
to change the RAM size because I haven't found a way to do it without rebooting.

Is there a way now or will I have to wait for RAM Hotswap in the kernel?

RAM is made up of two DIMM SDRAM modules, a 64MB PC100 (8nS) and a 
256MB PC133 (7.5nS). BIOS settings (8nS and 10nS are the options) don't seem to
matter and neither the socket position of the DIMMs.

Each memsize test was done more than once and the 'hump' around 148MB was 
dubbelchecked and all those compile times were found to be within a few secs. 
of the listed. Each test was done right after a reboot of the system.
 
Doing:  time make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install

With:   2.4.5-pre5 kernel compiling 2.4.5-pre5 source

I get the following times:
