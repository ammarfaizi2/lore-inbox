Hello,

I'll make this quick as I know how much traffic this list gets.

What version of the 2.4.x kernels is actually stable enough to use?  I
ask this because I see 2.4.2, but then the 2.4.2ac7 fix which from what I
have read on here, is a pretty important patch.   Is 2.4.2 or 2.4.1 stable
enough?  

I don't run a large site, but what I do have, I think would
benefit very much from the improved 2.4.x kernel over what I have mostly
have now, of 2.2.16's and 2.2.18's (if not for the the network stuff
alone).
