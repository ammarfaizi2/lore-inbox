Not much new, but still:

Today I got the same problem again with 2.4.18-pre3-ac2. Network
connections stuck, NFS mounts stuck. Bringing down/up the interface
doesn't help. Seems like the NIC is really in trouble here. Only a
reboot would bring the nick back in use.

Still no testcase though, and I have no idea on how to investigate this
:(
Can anyone give a hint as where to seek?

Regards,
- Robbert Kouprie
