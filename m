Public challenges kick ass. As people here know, I love a good flamewar :)

I follow my heart quite often, so I've no doubt I will be on the other
side of the coin.  I get dumped on by vendors for being staunchly GPL
when doing driver development.  We all pick our issues.  :)

No, it doesn't.  It was put into the tree for convenience.
It therefore stands to reason that removing it creates inconvenience.
Further, the only reason to remove it is ideology.  i.e. something
other than technical merit.  So your proposal is still a no-go.

My advice to you:  ignore Documentation/BK-usage, it is apparently
causing you anguish :)
