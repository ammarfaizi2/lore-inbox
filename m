Whoops, I retract that.  I did a quick scan of the page and ran into a link 
labled "Non-Commercial License Agreement and Software", attached to some form 
of license loaded with ugly patent words and so on.  My immediate reaction 
is: stay far, far away from that work, it is encumbered.  It would be nice if 
somebody knows differently, but for now I must ignore Vo's work.

Regards,

Daniel
