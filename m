This is degenerating, but I don't want anyone mistaking my position, so...

For the record and so nobody gets the the wrong end of the stick; I am a bk 
advocate. I use it for my open source activities, and urge others to do so as 
well.

But... There are tiny minority of people (who work on other SCM projects) who 
cannot access my sources because they can't use BK.

I don't particularly care, and I'm still using bk, but that particular clause 
of the bk license has caused Larry ridiculous amounts of grief for no 
discernable return.

And I still maintain that a stripped out, redistributable, clone/pull only 
binary tool without the restrictive license would be a real smart business 
move.

But it ain't my business, so I'll leave it there :)
