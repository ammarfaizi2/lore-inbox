No, but I would expect rules of kernel coding to be in there.  For
example, we were talking about using return mid-function.  I always
considerred that perfectly OK.  Others were saying that's a no-no.  If
it's a no-no, it should be documented.  That is, if it's a no-no.  That
may be a situational thing though.

99% of the people are running a microsoft based OS (It has 95% of the
market in terms of sales, but factor in pirated copies and your figure
will get close), of the 0.5% running linux, 0.025% of them are probably
subscribed to this mailing list.  Of that, probably 5% read it
regularly.  Now, of those 5% (of 0.25% of 0.5%), I'm probably getting
5-10 people reacting negatively (the rest are neutral reactions or no
reactions), and claiming to speak (in a rather -- shall we say --
arrogant and self-important manor) for the list as a whole.

Yeah, yeah, should've done it before..

p.s. Yes, all statistics are made up on the spot for comical purposes
only and are only half-way intended to represent the real world.  p.p.s.
given those percentages, 5-10 people may be a lot percentagewise, I
don't know, I haven't done the math.
