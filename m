Le Wednesday 09 November 2005 23:55, Bill Davidsen a =E9crit=A0:
 | Thank you Rickard and Damir for reassuring me that this change is
 | highly unlikely to impact any of the connection methods I use.=20

you're welcome

comparing our two emails, you can see that Rickard is much better used to=20
this matter than myself, as his email is more condense but has the same=20
information as mine. (see also my signature in this email)

 | Since PCMCIA on desktops and non-udev systems are uncommon, I felt the
 | question was better mentioned before the patch went in. Occasionally=20
 | my confiurations do result in a "nobody would do that" reaction.
=20
well placed questions never hurt (some answers may, but that's another=20
story :P )... and often other people find that they also wanted to know=20
the answer but didn't dare to ask.=20

greetings,
Damir

=2D-=20
If it takes a lot of words to say what you have in mind,
give it more thought.
