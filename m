Mr=2E Amaru U Etinam                                  
May 11th=2C 2003=2E
Branch Manager
EcoBank of Cote D=92Ivoire =28Abidjan Branch=29

I have an urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you=2E

On August 6th=2C 1997=2C an American Cocoa
merchant=2Fconsultant=2C Mr=2E Kelvin Thomas made a numbered
time =28fixed=29 deposit for twelve calendar months valued
at $25=2C000=2C000=2E00=28twenty-five million US dollars=29 at
my branch=2E Upon maturity=2C we sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no
reply=2E After a month=2C we sent a reminder=2E Eventually=2C
we discovered from his contract employer that Mr=2E
Thomas had died=2E Further investigations conducted by
me indicated that he neither left a WILL nor a
contactable next of kin or a relation in his entire
official document=2C including his bank deposit
information with us=2E

This amount is still available in my branch=2C and rolls
over with interest every year=2E Nobody has and will
ever come forward to claim this money=2E According to
our Country=92s Law=2C at the expiration of 5 =28five=29
years=2C this money will be reverted to the Ownership of
the Government=2C which in turn will end up in the hands
of some very corrupt and unscrupulous Government
Officials=2E Consequently=2C my proposal is that=2C I will
like you to stand in as his next of kin=2C so that this
old man=92s fruit of labor does not get into the hands
of uncaring Government Officials=2E There are legions of
less privileged people all over the world for whom a
meal is like paradise=2E I feel that other than allowing
this money to disappear=2C it will be more useful and
beneficial to give it out to charitable Organizations=2E
I need your assistance as a God fearing person to stand in as
his next of kin and claim this money=2E

The process is simple=2E According to my enquiries from
attorneys=2C all that is required to claim this money is
a letter of ADMINISTRATION from the probate registry
of the Federal High Court=2E An attorney will apply with
your name as his next of kin=2E A letter of
administration will be issued within Ten =2810=29 working
days=2E This letter will enable the attorney apply to
claim this money on your behalf=2C which would then be
transferred to you into a foreign account which you
will provide=2E I wish to point out that I want 40% of
this money to be shared among the charity
Organizations=2C while the remaining 60% is shared
equally between us=2E

This proposition is entirely risk free=2E A good
attorney would provide expert services while I will
use my position in the bank to guarantee the
successful execution of this transaction=2E If you are
interested=2C please contact me via my email address=3B
amarujaffar=40zwallet=2Ecom=2E
 Upon your response=2C I shall
then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand this
transaction well=2E Please observe utmost
confidentiality=2C and be rest assured that this
transaction would be profitable for both of us=2E I will
also require your assistance towards investing my
share in your Country=2E 

I look forward to your anticipated cooperation=2E

Sincerely=2C
Amaru  U Etinam=2E
