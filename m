	Am I the only one who read the sentence below:

Anthony Zografos, Reiser's boyfriend, said, "I have no thoughts. Until they
find Nina, I don't know what to think."

	And thought, "Hans was gay? No wonder he broke up with his wife".

	In fact, it wasn't until later when they mentioned Zografos was working
with Nina's best friend to make billboards that I realized I had
misunderstood it.
