I read this last Thursday on lwn.net:

	The end result is that next week's LWN Weekly Edition (August 1)
	will be the last. This has not been an easy decision to make, to say
	the least. But, barring some sort of last minute miracle (do contact
	us if you have one, please!), we do not see any alternative

We bought some advertising on LWN but can of course not keep them alive
ourselves. Does anybody here have ideas on how to keep them in business?

See http://lwn.net
