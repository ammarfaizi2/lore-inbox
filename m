Dear Brethen,

May the peace of God the father, the Son and the Holy
Spirit be with you all.

We are a non profit organisation resides in part of Africa.
Our organisation's name is Isaac's Hand Foundation.
We've decided to erased child abuse and some other things
which make the youths to be idles.

Our recent research made us to realised that many youths in
Africa were initiated to be a frauders, they don't have any
good intention or any room for the Lord in their hearts.
When you asked them, they have some reasons which might be
"Genuine" in their own eyes but in God's eyes there are no
excuse.

This Foundation now decided to stand on it's feet believing
that it will get a good support from International 
countries to say no to Child Abuse and change the mind of
youths for Christ.

We decided to have a National Seminars for youth and some
other programmes that will make these youths to know that
if they can study and work and trust God they can do good
in the land by not stealing or do frauding all around.
Brethen, we need your assistance, either in monetary terms
or materials.

Let's join hands to say no to child abuse in any form,
prostitutions and stealing and frauding in any form.
Remember that our Moses needed somebody to raise his hand
so that victory can be sure.

We shall be glad to read from you if you want to assist us
financially or materially contact us through this
