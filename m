Worse, it is allowed for a PowerPC implementation to not check if
stwcx. and
stdcx. refer to the same address as the preceding lwarx or ldarx .  So,
a store
conditional insn can succeed because the cpu holds some *other*
reservation.
Therefore, the kernel has to clear any reservation that might not have
been
generated by the user code it is returning to.
