Actually, I believe the wheel, and the rest of the user interface for an 
auto (gas pedal, brake) are a fine metaphor for this discussion.  The user 
interface for a car hasn't changed in how many years?  That is despite 
quite a number of technological devleopments under the hood.  Having a 
simple user interface for the "novice" doesn't prevent all kinds of weird 
shifting, throttle control, etc. additions for the "expert".  Having a 
single doorknob which controls, in a gross way, the action of a large 
number of "sub-knobs" is good.  Giving access to the "sub-knobs" for the 
expert is even better.
