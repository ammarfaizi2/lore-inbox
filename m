Then you notice that nowhere did you agree that your warranty validity 
is dependent on some little piece of technology.
You ask them to point out where you agreed to this.
They can't.
You threaten them, they ignore you.
You start a class action suit (cost to you: Zero in straight money, but 
a *lot* of time)
You win 7 years later (average time to resolve a lawsuit these days).
They get a big black eye.

If you don't want a class action, you take them to small claims court.
You'll win much quicker.

In short, they need to be able to prove that *you* damaged the drive.
They can't.
