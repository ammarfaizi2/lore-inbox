Well now that 2.5 is open I thought I'd add this to the wish list.  

1) I wish that ECC/ECP/IEEE 1294 would be fixed in 2.4 and 2.5 and work right as this is causing problems in some webcams that worked in 2.2.x but now no longer work in 2.4.  And since just about every major distribution is shipping 2.4 it makes it a little harder to use a 2.2 kernel if you get a dsitro as many are tuned to 2.4 and often don't work right with 2.2.  This actually killed my web cam somewhere around 2.4.10~13.14?

2) The nasty VIA ide-floppy / iomega zip 100 drive bugs would get fixed as well as this prevents people from using their zip drives under Linux   and forces them to use them under another OS.

just my .02 cents
