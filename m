That would be a propritary fuel injection driver then.

What we want however is access to the documentation, the=20
specifications, that allows us to develop a very own driver,=20
independently from the propritary one. We don't want source code or=20
anything. Of course if the hardware manufactor supplies us with=20
source code, that's great.

Probably any customly written driver will be suboptimal in the first=20
place, but OTOH there are so many skilled people around in the OSS=20
scene, that such a driver would surely soon catch up, if not even=20
surpass the propritary one.

Happy holydays
