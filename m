That isn't a problem - the GPL doesn't attempt to guarantee users the
INFORMATION needed to make sane changes, just that they have the facility
to do so. Just as the kernel doesn't come with a copy of the POSIX specs,
the RFCs, etc. - some of the standards the kernel implements aren't
available publicly, but that doesn't stop the kernel being freely
modifiable!
