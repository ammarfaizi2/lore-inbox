Few points.

- I don't believe that there is any such thing stable enough to be caled
  XP-final, or even XP-beta ;)  Specially when compared to the Linux kernel
  standards of stability.

- It is not necessary to compare linux with other low grade software ;)
  They may not work.  But linux do.

- I nevey use nor plan to use XP so I don't care if it doesn't work.
