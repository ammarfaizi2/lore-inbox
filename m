Hi all,

Please excuse me if my doubt is silly but do help me in answering this.

I compiled the ramfilesystem under fs/ramfs and got the object file
inode.o.

1.Should I do insmod to insert this module. 
2.After inserting this module how can I use "mkfs" to make this file
system befor mounting it.

Please help with the answers as I am highly confused.

Thanks in advance,

Regards,
sathish.j
