I have read the article posted on Net
"http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/3779". I am novice
and very keen in kernel programming and request all
techy quys to have patience while giving your
invaluable guidance to me. My questions may sounds
stupid but I will try to learn from your replies.

I have recently build and installed Vanilla Kernel
2.6.8 [kernel.org] and wants to work with work queue
interface. Do I need to install above patch to get the
work queue support in my vanilla kernel. Is the above
patch is compatible with kernel 2.6.8.

Thanks & Regards
