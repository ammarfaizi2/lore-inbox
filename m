Idea 1: You do have $10 and you are trying to free-ride (honest answer).

Idea 2: You don't have $10 or $20 a year to "spare"? Then probably you are using 
(old and) already supported hardware. And because past years developements
are free as in beer. If you ARE a developer, you get a free permament 
membership so you shouldn't care about all this.

Idea 3: Make bugfixes and hardware support are always GPL and not fGPL. The fGPL
will force you to distribute under GPL (or fGPL, at your choise).

Idea 4: Write your own drivers if nobody else would.

Idea 5: You are a student and as such are granted a free membership
until you finish your studies.
