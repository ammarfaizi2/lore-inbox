If you think this, you don't know Christoph then. We all know him
for his "warm words" and his frankness. Sometimes he may be quite
a bit excessive, but here I tend to agree with him. He simply meant
that these long threads are often totally useless and consume a lot
of time to real developers. Generally speaking, calling developers
to tell them "hey, you work the wrong way" is not productive. If you
tell them that you can improve their work and show some code, it's
often more appreciated. Yes I know you provided some links to sites,
but without proposing one real guideline nor project. You'd better
have posted something like "announce: merging of l4linux into
mainline" and telling people that you will start a slow, non-intrusive
merging work of one of your favorite project. You'd have got lots
of opposition but this would have been more productive than just
speaking about philosophy.

[ cut all the uninteresting info about your drinking habits that you
  sent to the whole world and which will be archived forever ]
