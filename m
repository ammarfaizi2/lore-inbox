From: Mrs Magret Hatch

  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Mr. Kazeem 
Hatch who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he 
died in the year2001.    We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a 
brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both 
born again Christians.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum 
of$5.6Million (Five Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with 
one Global Security Company in Spain. Presently, this money is still with 
the Security  Company.

Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three 
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better 
still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to 
instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund 
churches, orphanages,Research centers and widows propagating the word of God and 
to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to 
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.

I took this decision because I dont have any child that will  inherit 
this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I dont want my 
husbands hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I dont want a 
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the 
reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I 
know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom of the 
Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold 
my peace. I dont need any telephone communication in this regard because 
of my health because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me 
always. I dont want them to know about this development. With God all things are 
possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact 
of the Global Security Company  in Spain. I will also issue you a letter 
of authority that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this fund.

I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. 
Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please 
always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay  in your reply 
will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this  
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I  stated 
herein.   Hoping to hearing from you.


Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.


Yours in Christ,

Mrs Magret Hatch
