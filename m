Tomas,

Give Bartlomiej a break!

I have been working with and teaching him how to read the document.
I refused to give him the answers, he had to learn it while I guided him.
It took about 3-4 evenings on IRC for Bart to get it, while he still has
much to learn that only time will grant him.  I got in a shorter period
than me, but I had to learn much if it on my own and only at the threshold
of getting did somebody in the storage industry give me a swift kick in
the pants.

Somebody submit a patch to make Bart the maintainer of 2.5.


Sincerely,

Andre Hedrick
