Hi,

Are there any plans for a low volume list of announcements regarding the 
Linux kernel? For example, whenever Linus or Alan or whoever releases a 
kernel, I would find it very useful to be notified of this by e-mail, since I 
typically wish to run the latest stable Linux kernel that is available.

Sure this information is available here on the main list, although I 
personally do not have the time (or to be honest, the inclanation) to be on 
this list. As a result of this, I tend not to find out about the latest 
kernel releases until a day or two later and I notice a story on Slashdot, or 
stumble on to kernel.org, and see the announcement there.

Since I'm not on the list, I'd be greatful if any replies could be CC'd to me 
;)

Many thanks,
