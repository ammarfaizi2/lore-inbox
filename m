On this note, I recall a time that I 'appropriated' a workstation for
linux.

It was pulled out of the student labs, where it had worked for 3 months
running NT 4.0, but the RH install kept on crashing out.

I could even reinstall NT 4.0.

*shrug*

Eventually traced it down to memory, and had our hardware hacks replace
it.

Sometimes hardware problems can be subtle.
