hi,

Today, I am going to recompile the kernel by adding the support of 
RTLinux. The current kernel version is 2..6.9-1.677smp (my processor is 
P4 with HT)  from Fedora Core 3. The target new kernel is also the 2.6.9 
from www.kernel.org after patching by RTLinux. Everything goes smoothly 
while building the kernel. But when I check the modules generated by 
this build, there are a lot of them missed comparing the number of I 
have from the original Fedora Core 3.

Could you give me any hint about this?

Thanks,
Neo
