Hi!
I really don't know...
I use Debain 2.2r3 and always used the Bunk's packages to use 2.4.x
kernels. Did you try to compile the kernel instead of using the .deb
version?? 
I did never use a kernel in .deb format. So, I can not say if it is
the problem.
Try to get a kernel in tarball format and compile it by yourself.
If you need more help, feel free to contact me.
One more thing: send any error messages that can get when trying to
boot 2.4 kernel. It can be very useful.

Regards,
