I just wanted to followup on this bug report to say that I have been
contacted and informed how to contact with the XFS developers while
oss.sgi.com is down (the primary reason I sent the bug report here in
the first place).  I will be following up on this bug with the XFS
developers.  If anyone reading is interested in the outcome feel free to
contact me and I will keep you updated.

Thanks,
