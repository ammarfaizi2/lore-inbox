Yup.  Don't know what to do about it other than stay in charge.  If it
weren't for interactions like this with the community, I could make a
compelling case that giving away the software and maintaining the status
quo is in the best interests of BitMover.  As it stands right now, we
do it only because I insist on it and I own more stock than anyone else.

My goal is to arrive at some sort of reasonable point, put this flamage
behind us, and live happily ever after.  

We definitely derive benefit from having the kernel in BK.  It stresses
it, the kernel team has hard problems that we have no choice but to fix,
the product is better and continues to get better because of it.  The fact
that it works with what you guys do to it validates the product, that's
an important thing for us.  The so-called PR value is definitely offset
by the negative PR value we get from things like this weekend.  I think
I could make that go away simply by unsubscribing from the kernel list.
That's not very realistic, I like being on the list.  Another way to make
it go away is hire Chris Mason and get him to do for me what he did for
Hans.  Hans and I share some of that shoot-yourself-in-the-foot behaviour.
When Hans got Chris and Chris became the defacto interface to the outside
world I believe that was a turning point for the acceptance of resierfs.
Sometimes we are our own worst enemies.  So I need a Chris for BitMover.
