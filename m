Actually, in today's "User Friendly" comic strip (http://www.userfriendly.org)
one of the characters asks exactly that same question.

That's about as self-serving a statement as I've ever seen. If this
'Jim Alchin' actually believes what he's saying, he's got to be one
of the worlds biggest fools, and if he doesn't believe what he's
saying, well there aren't too many words that would accurately
describe what he is.

It's pretty funny in some ways, e.g. "We can build a better product
than Linux...", which begs the question, "Well, why don't you?".
Perhaps it costs too much?
