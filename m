No; my complaint is that I'm not _allowed_ to use BitKeeper.

I'll use it if you say it's ok.  Do you grant me permission?

Your license seems to request that I don't use it, because of other
programs I work on which have nothing to do with the kernel or
politics.  I'm not going to enumerate them; suffice to say I think
they fall under clause 3(d) of the bkl.  I could be mistaken.

(It seems ironic, given that you and I share an interest - in tools to
improve the software engineering process).

Thanks,

ps. Yes I know it's possible to pay - if I had any money.

pps. I was also letting you know you might like to update your web
page, which is out of date.
