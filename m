Okay. My JFS oops which was about the same style as the one that 
occurred in 2.5 has gone away. Unfortunately I have not figured out yet 
how to get my completely normal PS/2 keyboard to work with current 
kernel 2.5.33 because of input driver options weirdness. So I could not 
test it yet.
But then I guess the 2.5 JFS oops should have gone as well.
I cannot clearly state whether it was something that got fixed in JFS 
tree or if it was my upgrade of gcc, i.e. something got fixed in gcc and 
I do not want to test that.

Best regards and many thanks,
Axel Siebenwirth
