So we have a good patch that can make life better for developers and users.

Not to apply it is a *bad* decision. Linus, soon or later, you'll have to
replace the existing kbuild and you know that (it seems you're taking patches about it).

You must have some conflict with Keith, but i don't care about it. So,
if you have to replace the existing kbuild, why re-do it if it's done yet?.

<my suggestions, this doesn't means it's right>

Linus, please tell Keith that he changes kbuild just as you wants, and now. linux
is yours, and you've the right to take this kid of decisions. Leaders are for that.

And Keith, just try to do kbuild just like Linus wants. We'll help you, too. 

But please, we're not to be fools and re-do all the work again. kbuild 2.5 _is_ good
and all of us know that. So, please, please....don't let me think we're being so idiot....
