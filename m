Where can one obtain the ip_masq_icq.o module source for 2.2.x?
Searches on freshmeat turn up nothing, search on google turns up
a page that has module source for 2.2.x, 2.0.x but when
downloaded the file is corrupt (on the server side, not just my
download).  Further searching reveals nothing but dead web links
and email that point to nowhere as well.

Any help in obtaining the source for this module would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks.
