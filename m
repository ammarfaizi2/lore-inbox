Actually, you may have a point.

If the order of patches is:

 (1) Create new mutex as struct mutex/up_mutex/down_mutex, say.

 (2) Make counting semaphore implementation struct semaphore/up_sem/down_sem.

 (3) Convert uses of semaphores that should be completions into completions.

 (4) Convert uses of semaphores that should be counting semaphores to use
     up_sem/down_sem.

 (5) Mass convert by script all the remaining ups and downs into up_mutex and
     down_mutex.

 (6) Make wrappers for up/down that map to counting semaphores with the
     deprecation attribute set.

That might work, and would be a lot easier; except for the humongous patch
generated at step 5 - which could be regenerated by script. I think I can make
a simple perl script to do that.

Note that I am assuming above that down == down/down_trylock/down_interruptible
for clarity.
