	    I do have respect for you; however, I have one simple question.
    Should I call my system GNU/Linux/XFree86/KDE in order to give most
    everyone proper credit?

See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#many.

      Favorable or not, "Linux" has become the symbol for a whole
    system of free software.

The meaning attached to this symbol is one we disagree with (see
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html), so we will not accept
it as the symbol of our work.


I see a hint of "give up, it's hopeless" in your message.  In that
context, see http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#lost.
