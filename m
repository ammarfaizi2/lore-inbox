Rather, you should think about your poor hw. It's nice to sit down at least once
a year, to clean up your box of that spider/ant feudalistic colonies, bug
airports, to check connectors, upgrade some components, and other such things
which you can't risk doing online at 32bit platform. You know, there are
some x86s which wasn't projected to even LAST as long as one year :-)
