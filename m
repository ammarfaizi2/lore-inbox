I have a kernel module for a robot that was developed for
the 2.0 and 2.2 kernels and does not work under 2.4.
Unfortunately, the company that made it is not in business anymore.
It would be nice to have it working under 2.4, so is there someplace
that outlines some of the major things that would have changed so I can
update the module accordingly?

Thanks,
