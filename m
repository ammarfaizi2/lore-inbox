I'm pretty sure the Linux tty layer is not a piece of surviving Unix  
*code* at all. (Neither is the rest of Linux.) Look to *BSD for that.

The *interface*, and some parts of the design, may be - but so is the

And considering that AFAIR Unix *started* as a micro-MULTICS where certain  
ex-MULTICS-project people could continue to play with filesystems ...
