Good Day,

This is to inform you that we are into export and import of chinese
arts and crafts worldwide, we have customers all over the world, those
that love the chinese art works for interior decorations and for other
decors. We ask you to be our representative in receiving payments from our
customers on our behalf.

That is, whenever we are expecting payments from our abroad customers
or associates, we will ask you to help us receive the payments and
consequently give you instructions on where the funds will be paid to. The
reason for this is not far-fetched, we have a very slow process of
receiving and making payments abroad here in my region, and this hinders a
smooth dealings with our abroad customers and associates.
Hence you are now our representative in your country, whenever we are
expecting payments from our customers, the payment will be made through
you to us, and we will give you instructions on how you can be able to
also help us channel this funds to our associates abroad that helps us
in the shipment of our products.

For each payment made through you for us, you will be entitled to a 10%
of the total amount.You are mostly required to receive payments from
our customers on our behalf in your country.

Your full names,Phone number and contact address will be forwarded to
all our customers in your country now that you have indicated to work
with us for easy communications between you and the customers for purpose
of payments as quickly as possible.

Once again, do get back to us immediately as you receive any
communication from any of our customers ready to make payment so that we can
urgently advise you on what to do with the balance money after deducting
your 10% out of it.
