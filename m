The job *was* done by many others. You don't respect this.

P.S. Every time you strip out the names of the people that you quote, I
     have found your practice disrespectful. I don't *know* who wrote
     the quote you make above. Therefore, I do not know whose reputation
     has improved in my eyes, if only, because they share my opinion
     regarding you. Please retain the names of the people you quote.
