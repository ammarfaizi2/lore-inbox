Attn Sir,

My name is Adamu Yazid, i am the managing director of Prudent Bank PLC  here 
in Nigeria, on 20th Novmber 2004 MR. Haryanto Tomo from  indonesia, deposited 
the sum of U$10million dollars with
our bank here in Nigeria, up till then i did not heard from him not until when 
i received a news that there was a tsunami in asia that kill thousands of 
indonesia's, include one of nigerian Prudent customer Mr.Haryanto.
 
Right now i am contacting you to know if you can help me to receive the money 
over there as his relatives or next of kin, since all my effort to locate his 
family with the telephone number he gave me 
(62853700612) proved nothing, if you are willing to do this deal, you should 
not in any reason tell anybody about this transaction until you confirm the 
money in your account/home, because all we need is to get the document of 
(change of onwership account from the federal high court) on your 
behalf. Always call me on my direct line+ 234-80-331-27-410 for security 
reasons or 
email me on: adamuyazid2@indiatimes.com
 
Waiting for your call now
Adamu Yazid
