I formally request that Joerg Schilling be banned from the LKML until he 
learns how to take bugs in his program seriously. cdrecord has bugs, people 
hit them, and he won't either fix the bugs, or hand maintainership over to 
someone who wants to fix them.

Not only that, he constantly trolls on the LKML about how awesome cdrecord is, 
and how stupid kernel developers are. He also rears his head in any 
discussion on CD burning under Linux, even though it not always has anything 
to do with cdrecord; and totally derails any such discussion.

In addition to the aforementioned problems, he also has a serious hate for 
Debian, and the Debian developers who maintain the cdrecord package; in 
addition, he has lesser hate for all Linux developers, users, and basically 
anyone who isn't using Schillix or worshipping the ground he walks on.

I believe LKML is for serious discussion of Linux kernel development only, and 
for this to optimally continue, we need to purge the list of trolls like him.
