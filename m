McQ: (from George McQuary) Conventional limit on signature size.

>From AFW FAQ:

Q11. What is the McQuary limit?
A11. "There once was a man from Nantucket,
     who lost his .sig in a bucket.
     Five lines was too long,
     columns 80 just strong,
     so he didn't know where to tuck it."
A11. The limit on signature size:  "4x80".
