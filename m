Hmm. World (also in linux kernel) is not so efficient!
There are more tools for same task/problem. Maybe in the long run only one tools 
per problem will survive, but the diversity is good, also at cost of the 
duplicate work.

Do you want only one distribution for user, one for small companies, one for 
schools,...? Do you want only one web server implementation? Only one filesystem 
per task (only one journaling FS)?
Are they all "historical accident"?
