     Matti, i`m sorry of this... i just now realised why my mailserver
  was "dead" for 2 weeks - it just changed IP and i was unable to get your
  mail, so that i fixed the timezone only recently...
     I know its hard to write individual letters to each who is making mistakes
  on this list, so i apologize very very much...
     
thanks, Samium Gromoff
