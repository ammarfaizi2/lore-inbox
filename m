Hi,

	I have a couple of questions about sending patches. I did read the
SubmittingPatches Doc but don't recall this.

Can anyone send a patch to LKML to be applied?
How long does it normally take for a patch to be merged?
If a patch is not merged and I get no Replys, what should one do?

.Alejandro
