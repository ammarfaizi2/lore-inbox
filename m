Um, because I sort of tried to explain marketing to him, back when I was a 
contractor at IBM in late 1998?  (For which I would like to apologize to the 
community at large.  I MEANT well...)

Okay, time to come clean.  Back then the fsf web page had a whole "don't call 
the OS linux!" section, and I emailed Stallman to object.  Linux was a 
recognizable and growing operating system brand name, while the Gnu project 
was largely seen as a tool vendor in the wider community and "Hurd" meant 
nothing to most people (it could be a game or a spreadsheet for all we knew, 
or a floor wax for that matter).  So fighting against the Linux name was 
explicitly counterproductive from a marketing standpoint.  If we wanted to 
get people to use "Linux", they had probably at least heard of it.  Saying 
"It's not Linux!" would just confuse them.  Stallman's anti-linux crusade was 
diminishing one of free sotware's single biggest assets.

The REASON he wanted to do this, according to his web page, was that the hurd 
would replace the linux kernel.  I told him that if he really did want to 
position "Gnu Hurd" as an upgrade to "Gnu Linux", as his web page said, he 
first had to attach the GNU name to Linux, sort of like "kellog's raisin 
bran", "bud lite", or the way the "Turbo" name allowed Borland to sell many 
different types of compilers under one family (Turbo Basic, Turbo Pascal, 
Turbo C, Turbo C++.  Or Kellog's Rasin Bran, Bud Lite, etc...)

I exchanged three or four emails with him, and he agreed to stop trying to 
stop the use of the word Linux and instead promote the GNU organization more, 
and highlight its achievements and contributions to Linux.  It seemed like a 
good thing at the time...

I would like to apologize to the community at large.  I kind of got buried in 
work and dropped my half of the conversation for a month or two, and then 
this "GNU/Linux" thing hit the headlines and I winced a lot.  It had turned 
into an ego thing and he'd completely missed the marketing point I'd been 
trying to make, he had no product to promote except himself and blowing your 
own horn has ramifications that deprive it of effectiveness...  Anyway, I 
emailed him again and tried to go over some of the problems with his first 
attempt at marketing, but he was on the road and buried in email, and 
generally wasn't listening anymore...

I was also naieve enough back then that I didn't realise the marketing niche 
I was pointing him at was already filled by distributions: Red Hat Linux, 
Slackware Linux, etc.  The last distribution I'd used at that point was SLS. 
:)  I actually thought the FSF was trying to put out a Linux distribution.  
(Well they did -- Debian -- but the project forked away and disassociated 
itself from them politically.  (Lots of projects seem to do that...)  I think 
the FSF's web page was a bit out of date when I was trying to catch back up 
on Linux after a long digression into OS/2 and Java.  Although Debian is 
still sort of aligned with the FSF, and as such is the only Linux 
distribution to listen to stallman enough to slap GNU/ on their official 
name.  Or to try to make the Hurd actually run.  I think it was debian's web 
page that pointed me back to gnu.org at the time, actually...)

So now you know.  Once again, I am deeply sorry.  At least he stopped telling 
people not to use the word "Linux" at all for the name of the OS...

Rob

(Last time I spoke to him, which was quite a while ago now, he had a similar 
problem with "intellectual property".  The whole of the FSF is one big 
crusade about the scope and application of intellectual property law, and 
that's really his main area of strength, but he doesn't like to use the 
phrase "intellectual property", which puts him at a bit of a disadvantage 
discussing it if you ask me...)
