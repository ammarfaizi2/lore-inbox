Being firmly in the full disclosure camp I hope you intend to stick to 
that "no entity (neither the reporter nor any particular vendor/developer) 
can require silence" bit. If you do, and if embargoes are kept to short 
nr. of days, then I think such a list would probably be a good idea. It 
would be a good compromise between full disclosure from day one and things 
being kept secret and out of view for months.
