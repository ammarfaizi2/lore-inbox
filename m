Hello,

This may be of interest to those of you who read this email in the
digest version of this list.

My python script converts the digest version of this list into a HTML
file that is a little more convenient to read.  It does things like
build a linked contents section, link messages for easy scrolling,
colour replies and highlight urls/emails.

You can call it manually from mutt or put it in procmail.
