I totally agree.  The poll was a stated position on the gplv3, it
didn't attempt to represent the positions on the core issues of
patents and DRM.

I personally do have a problem with what Tivo does with code
that I wrote, yet I also recognize that a license might not
be the best place to deal with this.
