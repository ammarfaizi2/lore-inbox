Hi Chris,

I'm very curious about this comment - wondering what you base it
on?  I'm the engineering manager for IRIX real-time - we have
no open bugs against it and have many customers depending on it.
At least for the last 5 years had very low maintenance cost,
mostly adding features, fixing a couple of bugs and producing new 
releases.  

Perhaps you would be so kind to let me know what led you to
your statement?

Thanks,

Lori Gilbertson
