Ummm. nope. Wrong (or at least very incomplete).

Lawyers CAN own the new idea - they can copyright their presentations
preventing others from using them without first paying for the right
to use all/part of the presentation in other cases.

Lawyers are closer to high profile consultants.

The same can be said for consultants :-)

Actually, they are the management. These practicing lawyers only handle the
most exclusive clients (and for the most $$$$ possible). All others contribute
a cut to the firm (and charge less $$$$ to the customer).

Thats the same way a consulting company works.

And who is charged for the time?
Who gets the direct benifit of the work?

You must have a customer/client that is identified for all billing.
Personally, I think Red Hat is doing the best job of this:

1. provide consulting to clients paying for help.
2. providing custom software to clients paying for it.
3. providing short debug/fix/patches cycles to clients/customers paying for it.
4. advertising their capabilities to attract more (paying) customers/clients.
5. funding developement out of their charges to customers.
6. funding debug/fix/patch cycles for applications that do not have paying
   clients/customers. Probably charging this to "overhead" or
   "marketing/advertisment" to expand their list of capabilities.
7. Being good enought to pass those developements/fix/patches to the rest of
   the world via GPL/LGPL licenses.

IBM is doing a similar thing, though I suspect they count the expense of the
open source development/debug people into the charge passed to the customer
purchases of their hardware (ie. bundled into hardware cost) or
overhead/marketing overhead, or in consulting fees.

Not being an employee of either RH or IBM, the above statements are, of,
course, my opinion of how they are looking at things.

The other side of coin is "what do the customers get"
1. someone to call when they have problems
2. customized software aimed at their environment
3. a lower expense than the M$ tax
4. a better (ie. more reliable/secure) product than M$ can produce

What does the world get out of it:

1. an alternative to the M$ tax
2. a better (ie. more reliable/secure) product than M$ can produce
3. the ability to modify the software, learn how things work, limitations
   of the software
4. a better personal knowlege environment allowing the potential to be better
   employed by other busineses.
5. an ever expanding knowlege of how/why/what software works
