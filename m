I always wonder what should be said by testers when beta software actually
*works*. ;)

I've been successfully running 2.5.60 on my Tycho system since a few minutes
after Linus announced it. The major bugs I'd had in 2.5.59 were with Alsa,
which seems to be running well in 2.5.60.

Tycho
  Debian 'sid' GNU/Linux, Kernel 2.5.60 SMP (custom)
  2.8GHz Pentium 4 w/HT, Intel D850EMV2, 533MHz FSB
  512 MB PC800 RDRAM, 80GB Maxtor D740X 7200 RPM ATA-100 HD
  WinFast A170, GeForce 4 MX 440 GPU, 64MB DDR

I wonder if testers should post configs that worked, so developers can
compare against configs that failed?
