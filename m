He isn't 'here'  here being at work.
He's "here" (here being in the world).  It's quite possible that
someone on vacation would have the time to take a look at his
(or her, where he a she) life and decide "You know, this is
bullshit". Such looking and deciding would then lead to a
communication such as what we have witnessed here..

Such a decision having been come to, the magicks of email
empower a person to be in communication from almost anywhere
in the world. You may not be aware of such magickal capabilities
of email. but if that's the case, I would suggest that you are on
the wrong mailing list.

Happy April Fools Day.

Powerful committed communication, reaching through fear, uncertainty and
doubt to touch the jewel within each person and bring it to life.
