[yet another big snip]

Hihi, life is unfair to you. ;-) I am one of those nasty gentoo users 
and still use devfs, but I want to switch asap, as I found a thread in 
gentoo forums about it and furthermore tend to do experiments with my 
installation. So not all gentoo users are bad users. ;-) I really 
appreciate your work and hope you will find more time in developing udev 
instead of wasting time (though it was quite interesting for me to read 
your text) with arguing for it. So I hope when I do the transition it 
goes smoothly, but even if not, I won't bash onto your head. ;-)

Cheers,

Prakash
