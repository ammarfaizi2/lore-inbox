Five years is a long time.  Sources for windows 1996 anyone?

Nope.  It might cause microsoft to ensure that nothing remains backward
compatible for as much as five years.  True innovation is one way, 
obfuscation and needless interface changes and standards
breakage/"extension" 
is the easier route.  What tends to happen when a competitor implements
some popular standard better than ms does?
