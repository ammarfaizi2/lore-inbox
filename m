Ok, can you please point to me where is the place it should be taken off ? I
suppose you mean LKML ? 

> lists on the same posting, there is absolutely no point in doing that.

We already had this discussion on debian-legal and debian-kernel, so i
included them for documentation purpose, so people there can follow the
discussion even if they don't follow LKML which is rather high volume. As the
discussion already was hold there, i don't believe you will see many comments
from them.

So, i posted to LKML directly, as i believe that it is where this needs to be
solved, as only the copyright holders can fix this licencing problem, and
currently the kernels distributed from ftp.kernel.org are not legally
distributable.

Friendly,

Sven Luther
