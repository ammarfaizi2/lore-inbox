Exactly.

C'mon guys, put back the driver and hooks, and let the users decide. This 
is not only about you, but about thousands of people using this driver, 
whether they know it or not.

I've bought and returned 3 webcams from logitech and creative last week 
because I couldn't get them to work in Linux. Aided by the philips webcam 
driver website, I ordered a philips webcam. Today my cam arrived, and all 
I can find is that the drivers have been removed - making webcam support 
in Linux pretty much zero (at least the ones I can find here). Completely 
ridiculous.

You know, I promised my girlfriend she could talk to her family 2000km 
away in Finland. She's waiting right here next to me, and I dare you to 
explain this idiotic zealotry to her. Or any normal person, for that 
matter. And how happy are the people at Philips going to be after their 
support to find out it was all for nothing? Not good. Not good at all. And 
we really need some support in these areas.

Maybe Philips will open up their oh so secret compression algorithm if we 
all ask them nicely. I mean, how secret can that still be?...

Put it back.
