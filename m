  Ok, I've found the description of this on handhelds.org, and
it appears to be a derivative of xscribble, which I have tried.
Unlike xscribble it does fullscreen mode, which is good, but
it's still single-character and requires the user to learn
how to write all over again.  In other words, like everything
else available on Linux (and even MS's Jot) it's *crap* compared to

  I would give my eye teeth for a Linux version of Calligrapher.
