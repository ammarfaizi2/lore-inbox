Dear Friend,

My name is Paul Campbell, a senior staff and executive of 
a 
bank here in Scotland, United Kingdom.I have only written to seek 
your 
indulgence and assistance.

I wish to make a transfer involving a 
huge 
amount.I am proposing to make this transfer to a designated bank 
account of your choice.Thus,  for your indulgence and support, I 
propose an offer of 25% of the total amount to be yours after the 
transfer has been successfully
concluded.

Kindly reply me stating 
your 
interest, and I shall furnish you with the details and necessary 
proceedure with which to make the transfer.
I anxiously await your 
response.Thanks and Godbless.
