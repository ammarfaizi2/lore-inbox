Or AppleWorks (Mac), in my case.  Or, if I wanted to be flashy, I'd 
make the slides up in CorelXARA (which originated on the Acorn and 
would probably run under WINE today) and move them to 
GraphicConvertor (Mac) for display.  I daresay it's possible to do 
all that under Linux, but I haven't found such readily-available 
solutions staring me in the face yet.

Incidentally, you don't need a flashy presentation to make an impact. 
I won a prize this month largely based on a presentation I did - the 
content was king, the slides were white-on-black text, and I 
stammered my way through the actual presentation (I'm not good at 
public speaking).  The close runner-up had done a big flashy 
PowerPoint presentation, was better at public speaking, but hadn't 
researched his material quite so thoroughly.

I use Linux for programming and servers.  I still use my Macs for 
regular day-to-day workstation duty.  That's the status quo, and it 
will only change slowly and with much effort.
