As some of you may be aware, there has recently been some confusion about the 
terms of the license covering the firmware for the Intel PRO/Wireless network 
adapters (raised on the mailing list last week).  The key question by Linux 
users/distributors revolves around whether or not the firmware license supports 
redistribution.  The answer is (as many of you know) "yes".

I've spent some time speaking with our legal team to try and clarify the issue 
and so have put together a few quick usage questions that try and illustrate how 
the license works.  You can find those questions and their answers at 
http://ipw2100.sf.net/firmware_faq.php

For various reasons (many of which have been touched on in this mailing list in 
many different threads) Intel can not change the terms of the license to support 
what some refer to as an "unencumbered" or "non-restrictive" license.  We 
recognize the need of the Linux community to be able to freely (as in beer) 
redistribute the firmware and the license supports that.

If you have any questions about the license, or need further clarification, 
please don't hesitate to send me an email off list.

Thanks,
