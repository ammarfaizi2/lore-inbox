Hello

I am looking into buying a QDI Kinetiz 7E-A motherboard with the VIA
Apollo KT-133 chipset (famous vt82c686b south bridge). From the March
thread "Re: Linux 2.4.2ac12 (vt82c686 info)"
(http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0103.1/0013.html)
it looks like Vojtech Pavlik's VIA drivers from 2.4.2-ac12 (and
up?) kernels work stably with this chipset. Can somebody just confirm my
assumption, or maybe somebody is using exactly this motherboard?

BTW, wouldn't it be a good idea to have somewhere (kernelnewbies/
kernel.org?) a list of known kernel-hardware/whatever problems and their
progress, so that people like me don't bother the list.

Sorry, I am not subscribed to the list (not any longer - couldn't cope
with the traffic:-(), I will look through the archive, but CC would be
highly appreciated.

Thanks
Guennadi
