It would be most accurate to label 2.4 as "stablizing", meaning that
bug fixes only are being accepted. Of course some pretty extensive
bugs are being working on... like the Virtual Memory area...

Stable versions come from distributors who test a given level
extensively, and add in any needed fixes, and stand behind the result.
You can't expect that from developers and you won't get it even if you
do expect it.
