I am glad that the discussion is heading to the right place thanks to David.

Yes. Probably that is the best solution. In the case of the ring buffers, 
based on my discussion with Damien, 4 buffers are probably optimal. If the 
user is allocating them, in case of normal cameras, this is somewhere around 
4 MiB, lets say maxim 16 MiB. So, everything should be ok for normal people, 
at least for now. The problem is when the cameras require bigger images (we 
are thinking about the future, right) and maybe also more buffers in the DMA 
ring buffer. If you leave that to the user, it will require some hacking 
skills if we are using the current model from libdc1394 and video1394. Why? 
Because if you use 10 buffers with some big images it is likely you are going 
out of the 64 MiB. In that case, we were thinking to give a nice error (that 
is why we needed to know the amount available for mmap/vmalloc) and instruct 
the user to change the kernel boot time allocation of memory in a way that 
will fit the range (the vmalloc=xxx at startup - the "hacking"). So, in a 
way, it will be nice to have the solution close to the one proposed by David. 
Do you think that if the user allocates small buffers (instead of the big 
ring buffer) and sends the list to the driver, this will help in breaking the 
64 limit? I have doubts about it, but I am not good at this level of VMA. 
Anyway, I hope that something can be done to allow bigger DMA ring buffers 
without the user needing to reboot the system with some parameter.
