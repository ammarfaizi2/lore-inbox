Hi all,

currently I ask myself what is the difference between the "Intel 
PRO/1000 MT Desktop Adapter" and the "Intel PRO/1000 T Desktop 
Adapter". The first (MT) is built with a 82540OEM Chip and the second 
(T) with a 82544GC Chip.

Is there something "very special" with the chips? Is one of both 
better (faster and/or more stable and/or less CPU-eating) than the 
other? I plan to use Linux 2.4.18 (if no other chance a newer one) 
with these NIC's....


Thank you in advance,
  Michael
