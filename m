I dual-boot the COMPAQ Presario 1800. I have had zero problems with
it under Linux-2.4.18 and very few problems under Win/2000/Prof.
It's not a great performer, it uses the same interrupt for about
everything and has a slow disk. I have an ACOM external USB/Firewire
drive that works fine as well.

Cheers,
Dick Johnson
