Nobody is doubting that population inversions do exist. And you also can
do all kind of mathematics with it if you like and even calculate a
temperature. But I think you shouldn't interprete this kind of temperature
as something that is macroscopically existant or even measurable. You
also wouldn't say quantum wave functions do exist, would you ?

I agree and I think we shouldn't get too out of topic ...
