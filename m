Extended changelog for 2.4.19pre7aa3 at
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/andrea/2.4.19pre7aa3.html

Another new page is benchmarks on the latest releases from 
various kernel trees:
http://home.earthlink.net/~rwhron/kernel/latest.html

The "latest" page will get updated very regularly.
The purpose of the "latest" page isn't to say kernel
X is better than Y.  It may be useful for people who 
like to experiment with patches, hunting for what gives 
a kernel it's edge.  Each kernel excels in different 
areas.  

If there are any hunters out there, you may want to
look at the pages by tree and the big page too.  Some
of the tests vary between runs, and others are pretty
consistent.  

Have fun.
