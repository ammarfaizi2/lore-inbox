Really. You think if I read a GPL'd example of a piece of code I can't
write a non GPL'd one. Companies use two sets of people to ensure that
there are no questions (one set write the spec, the other to write from
that spec in a different building).

Rude yes, but derived work.. open question. I guess Eben can give you a
reasonably sane opinion if its so important.
