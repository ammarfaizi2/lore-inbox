It's not about me, I myself had the ext3+tg3 patches applied since...well,
don't remember exactly, but it's been a while now. I'm reading lkml. This
was just meant as a suggestion to provide a kindof "help" or "support" to
people not reading lkml but building their own kernel. A mailinglist or
central place where they can get all the urgent fixes for the latest stable
kernel (here 2.4.20).
