Hi,


I have an USB wireless adapter made by Micronet. 
Model name is SP907 V3.

It is an USB device that has one PCMCIA slot that hosts the wireless 
adapter. The USB device acts like a host for the PCMCIA card. Is there any 
support in Linux for such wireless network adapter ?





Regards,

L. K.
