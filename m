That is nice to know since it has never been submitted to the Committee
and the last time I checked with the author it was 3.0.  Then again you
are so vast with knowledge, maybe you submitted 3.3 ... LOL.

You are so full of BULLSHIT it is no longer funny.

e02112r1 is the current revision for project proposal for EDDS 3.0.

Gee, where is Martin's name and or Company to be found for the adoption
into ATA-7.

No where.
