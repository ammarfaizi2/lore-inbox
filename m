Hi,
I am running a ~2GB reiserfs-3.5 partition, created
with SuSE's backport, since long with no problems.
However, when copied the harddisk to another which
has a newly-created 3.6 partition of 2.4.3-ac3,
it was not that stable. For example, deleted logfiles
re-appear sometimes, and apache/squid logfiles can
be huge. It is not reproducible.
Just because I read about rasierfs.
