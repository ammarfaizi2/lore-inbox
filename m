In the Linux Magazin 09/04(a german linux magazine) i found a news 
artikel about removing the UMSDOS part of the kernel. I don't use this 
module but if you remove parts of the kernel that have been so usefull 
in the past and you won't remove it because of the needing in the past 
than make a new directory in the kernel package that is named r.i.p. 
oder rip. And there you can make txt files which discribes the removed 
parts and a tribute to the authors of these parts.

I hope this was the right place to post this and it was no joke from me. 
It was a seriously suggestion
thx for Linux and for the GNU
