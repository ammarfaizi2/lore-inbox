This just in: Linux 2.4 VM still useless.

I have 2 GB main memory and 4GB swap on a 2-way intel machine running a
variety of 2.4 kernels (we upgrade every time we have to reboot), and we
have to power cycle the machine weekly because too much memory usage + too
much disk I/O == thrash for hours.

Gosh, I guess it is silly to use all of the available RAM and I/O
bandwidth on my machines.  My company will just go out of their way to
do less work on smaller sets of data.
