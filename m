I'd be interested to hear what the debian legal people think of this,
but my reading of the GPLv2 is that mirror sites are already
effectively granting a patent license by distributing GPLv2 programs. 

Maybe this has already been discussed to death somewhere else and some
solid legal conclusion has been come to? If so, can someone please
send me a link :)

Cheers, Tridge
