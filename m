Marcelo,

You are suggesting that 2.6 is not stable ?  How could that be ?
Should it not be backported to 2.2 and why not 2.0 ?

What about the rest of the feature sets ?

Necessary? But their is the new and improved called 2.6.
It is time for the old and lousy to quietly wimper off and die.

Regards,
