[Yamaha Firmware winds up CD-writer]
> Yummy ... wonder if it happens the same with their motorbikes.

Haven't heard of similar troubles with their motor bikes or stereo
equipment (except they claim higher electrical power output for their
active speakers than the input of the respective power supply is rated.
I wonder how they do _that_.)

The Yamaha writers I had - AFAIR - were rated to a max. of 40°C (104°F;
313 K) and didn't last very long.
