Hi:

This bug was discovered by Alex Samad.

The del_timer_sync call in ahc_linux_free_device added in 2.5.67
leads to an SMP deadlock when the function is called from the timer
itself in ahc_linux_dev_timed_unfreeze.

I haven't dug too deeply but it seems that there are also possible
races where ahc_linux_free_device can be called twice on the same
dev.  Once from the timer and then again from a non-timer location.

Cheers,
