IANAL but I believe that this is a myth. Even if they violate the GPL they 
would still own their code. Of course, they may be required to stop using it 
and to pay some money to Linus if he sues. 
Most probably they will GPL it anyway if you ask, because it makes no sense 
to them to have bad publictiy, a lawsuit and code they are not allowed to 
make use of.

Just my 0.02 euro.
