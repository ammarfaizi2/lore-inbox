I would be happier if someone based in the US (and more familiar with
the US legal system) could take up this one.

Maybe Hans Reiser is interested doing something about it, I've already
had gpl enforcement related contact with him in the past and he seemed
very interested.

I would recommend moving this thread off the technical mailinglists.

Everyone who wants to continue discussing the legal aspects is invited
to join the legal@lists.gpl-violations.org mailinglist, see more info at=20
http://gpl-violations.org/mailinglists.html#ml-legal

Thanks.
