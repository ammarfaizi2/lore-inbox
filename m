Hellow Guys, How are you? 

I search in kernel archives and Changelogs for information about the 
syncookies firewall breaking problem , where one person can bypass the 
firewall in one machine with TCP SYNCOOKIES enabled and where the firewall 
are based on SYN filtering to block only incoming TCP connections, but let 
outgoing connections pass. 

The lastest stable version of kernel 2.4.17 have it corrected?
If yes, in which version of kernel it are corrected?
If not, when it will be corrected? 

 

Thanks a lot for attention and sorry for my poor English.
