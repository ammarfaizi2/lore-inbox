Well, part of the charm of the name is that it's totally meaningless. I 
can pick names out of my *ss, and they don't matter in the least, and 
nobody will ever see it except in the kernel diffs.

(As to Lordi, I've only ever seen their Eurovision thing on Youtube, 
because those pesky US networks thinks we're interested in some kind of 
inferior "American Idol" copycat product. But unless you've lived in 
Finland during the 80s and 90s, you just simply cannot appreciate the 
"Whaaa?" factor of having Finland win the dang thing. Imagine a whole 
_country_ going "Whaaa? What the f?" at the same time..).
