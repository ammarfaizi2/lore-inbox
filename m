Speaking as a Linux _USER_, if this happens, can I get said print
engine working on my ARM machines with these closed source drivers?
Can Alpha users get this print system working?  Can Sparc uses
get it working?  What?  I can't?  They can't?  Well, its no good to
me nor them.  You've just made the system x86 specific.  Well done,
thats a step backwards, not forwards.

Oh please nice big corporation, can you please build said closed
source stub for ARM?  No?  Why?  You don't see the point?

Ah, golly, I'll just have to throw my ARM machines away because
we have some critical parts of the system which are closed source.

Good.  I build the stuff to work on my ARM machines.

They don't work on ARM though, do they?  Gee, I guess ARM Ltd ought to
stop my contract because what use is an ARM kernel without everything
else to go with it?

For me, closed source is _REALLY_ bad news.  _EXTREMELY_ bad news.
It 100% prevents me from doing stuff.

Its really good that the Linux community is so open.
