I have noticed that Linux 2.4.0-test12-pre7 still comes with .8final. Is
there a plan to have .9 incorporated at some future time into the stock
2.4 kernels? Will this happen before 2.4 comes out?

Also is there a transition path between .8final and .9? (short of save
everything to tape and restore?)
