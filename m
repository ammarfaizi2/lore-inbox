Hi everyone.

I've been involved in a little discussion this morning about reporting
driver bugs. In the past, I've tended to point people directly to the
driver author, but I've learnt that the preferred thing is to get people
to open reports on bugzilla.kernel.org.

I'm therefore writing to ask if those of you who help with triage could
point people there as well.

Thanks, and thanks for all your help!

Nigel
