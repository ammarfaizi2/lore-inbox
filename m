DEAR PARTTNER,

 MY NAME IS MR. NELSON RUFUS. I AM WRITING IN RESPECT OF FOREIGN CUSTOMER
OF MY BANK WHO DIED IN A PLANE CRASH (ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT 261) WHICH
CRASHED ON JANUARY 31 2000, INCLUDING HIS WIFE AND ONLY DAUGHTER SINCE
THE DEATH OF THIS CUSTOMER, I PERSONALLY HAVE WATCHED WITH KEEN INTEREST
TO SEE THE NEXT OF KIN BUT ALL HAS PROVED ABORTIVE AS NO ONE HAS COME TO
CLAIM HIS FUNDS OF US$10.5M (TEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED
STATES DOLLARS) WHICH HAS BEEN WITH MY BANK FOR A VERY LONG TIME.ON THIS
NOTE I DECIDED TO SEEK FOR WHOSE NAME SHALL BE USED AS THE NEXT OF KIN AS
NO ONE HAS COME UP TO BE THE NEXT OF KIN. IN VIEW OF THIS I GOT YOUR
CONTACT THROUGH MY COUNTRY`S FOREIGN TRADE MISSION AFTER I WAS CONVINCED
BY PROVIDENCE THAT YOU COULD BE USED AS THE NEXT OF KIN. THE REQUEST OF
THE FOREIGNER AS A NEXT OF KIN IN THIS BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT
THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A NIGERIAN CANNOT STAND AS THE NEXT
OF KIN TO FOREIGNER.

I AGREED THAT 30% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS A FOREIGN PARTNER
,WHILE THE REST WILL BE FOR ME, THERE AFTER,I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR
DISBURSEMENT AS I AM ALMOST DUE FOR RETIREMENT.THEREFORE, TO FACILITATE
THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOUR ACCOUNT AS ARRANGED, YOU MUST
APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A RELATION TO THE DECEASED INDICATING YOUR
PRIVATE TELEPHONE NUMBER, AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY COMMUNICATION AND
LOCATION WHERE THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.UPON THE RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY,
I WILL SEND YOU BY FAX OR E-MAIL THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE.

 I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS BUSINESS IS HITCH-FREE
AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEAR AS THE WHOLE REQUIRED
ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSFER.

YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME THROUGH THIS EMAIL (nelsonruf@graffiti.net )
IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU.

YOUR RESPECTFULLY,

 MR. NELSON RUFUS
