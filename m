I need a way from the RPM utility to determine this without writing some 
huge ugly bash script.  The 7.1 release is not putting it where uname 
will return the correct name string.

Hummm.  Where are the patches for 2.4 to correct this?  They are not posted
with the 7.1 release.  They need to be.  The compiler not supporting 
#ident for CVS is a show stopper, and needs correcting ASAP.  How can 
someone use CVS properly with this, Alan?
