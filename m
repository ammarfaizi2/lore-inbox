In your mind only

This thread started out as "CD writing future in Linux" and that's where it 
has been. We all know that you claim all the problems cdrecord has with Linux 
are in libscg, but that doesn't excuse you from ignoring the posted topic and 
trying to change it so you can rant about how bad the SCSI subsystem in Linux 
was designed.
