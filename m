You've demonstrated over and over again that you work for a constantly
stupid company. 

Please find someplace else to work, your issues have become more depressing
then amusing. :)

It's sad that people like the one who sent out messages like that can stay
employed. In the last year there have been several Windows love-bug type
worms each causing damaged estimated in the billions. One or two Linux worms
that go after a long fixed problem with no published accounts of significant
damage and you get that sort of email..
