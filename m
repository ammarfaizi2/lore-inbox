This stuff I'm talking about is not theoretical. It's been in Novell 
Netware since 1990 and it works great. Netware with DOS in 1990 is still 
far superior to Linux today. Once you've had Netware - Linux is 
laughable. All youhave to do is look ate Netware and copy it. Or the 
mars-nwe netware emulator for that matter. The code to do this already 
exists.
