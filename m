Guys, which part of "he who writes the code gets to choose the license" 
do you not _get_?

I find few things more morally offensive than whiners who whine about 
other peoples choice of license.

I found it totally inappropriate when some of the crazier BSD guys were 
whining about the use of the GPL in Linux for _years_. They seem to 
finally have shut up lately, or maybe I've just gotten sufficiently good 
at ignoring them.

But I find it _equally_ offensive when somebody whines the other way. I 
can understand it from rms, if only because I _expect_ it. But why the 
hell people who didn't actually DO anything whine about Peter's choice of 
license FOR THE CODE HE WROTE, I don't see.

This is the "shut up and put up" philosophy of software licensing. Either 
you do the work, or you sit quietly and watch others do it. If you do the 
work, you get to impact the license. If you don't, you had better SHUT THE 
F*CK UP!

Btw, the same goes for every single BK whiner out there.
