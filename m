The other example specifically mentioned was the CVS documentation for jfs,
and yes, I think that moving those instructions to the web site in question
would make a lot of sense, leaving a URL wherever the docs once were.  By
definition, the CVS instructions will be available on that site as long as
they are useful, and not a moment longer.

This is all irrespective of the fact that CVS does not have the problem of
having a restrictive license, but since you asked...
