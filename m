Hi

I managed to get an IBM PC-Server 720 which has 4 cpus but a C-Bus II
Chipset which is not SMP-Compatible. Was there any progress supporting
theses systems with more than one cpu in the last time? Perhaps IBM
could be willing to release some informations about this system if
somebody is intrested in writing a driver for this chipset.
