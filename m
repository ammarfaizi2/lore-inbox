Hi Brad,

There was an announcement earlier today of some networking
documentation.  I think that it's still in its early stages, though.

>From the 'netdev' list:

Hi,

I am working on a doc on "Networking Subsystem" in the Linux kernel.
This
is part of the "Linux Kernel documentation project" (www.lkdp.tk).

Chapter 2 of this doc is almost complete. I was hoping for some feedback
on this doc. Its available at

www.corewars.org/~radical/lkdp

Only Chapter 2 has been started as of now, its nearing completion.

I am looking for feedback on the contents, the general feel of the book,
flow.. etc. Any kind of feedback actually.

Thank you
-Anks
