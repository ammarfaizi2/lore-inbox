That's just the FSF's interpretation. Unless a court says it is actually
the right interpretation, it is up in the air (sure, the FSF interpreting
it this way will have some weight in court, but it is by no means
definitive).

For the kernel, Linus has clarified the license of the kernel (it is _not_
vanilla GPL), see COPYING. And one would assume that if somebody
contributes voluntarily, they are agreeing to the licence...
