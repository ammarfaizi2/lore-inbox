Subject: 2.6.4-rc1 oops on HPFS filesystem file rename

When saving an edited file residing on a HPFS filesystem I get the  
following
oops.
Kernel is 2.6.4-rc1, compiled with gcc 3.3.2. After this any access to  
the
filesystem hangs the session. Kernel 2.6.3 has the same behavior. Don't  
know
about earlier ones.

I get similar oopses when trying to move or delete a file on the  
filesystem.
