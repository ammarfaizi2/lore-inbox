Hi all,

I told Andrew about this the other day, but he's caught up in the
fleshpots of Ottawa this week, so I thought I'd see what the rest of the
list thinks.

This program:

#include <unistd.h>
#include <sched.h>

static int thread(void *v)
{
	pause();

	return 0;
}

static unsigned char stack[4096];
int main()
{
	static char *arg[] = { "id", NULL };

	clone(thread, &stack[sizeof(stack)-sizeof(void *)],
	      CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES|CLONE_SIGHAND|CLONE_THREAD, 0);

	execve("/usr/bin/id", arg, NULL);

	return 1;
}

causes the main thread to hang unkillably in execve(). In particular,
the wchan is flush_old_exec, and the stack trace indicates it is blocked
in wake_up_process_kick:

0   500  6462  6448  19   0  1348  236 flush_ D    pts/5      0:00 ./exec-deadlock

It looks like it might be a deadlock with mmput in the dying child
thread.  The rest of the system is running fine; this only seems to
affect these particular tasks.

This is on a UP x86 laptop; .config below.  Possibly notable is
CONFIG_PREEMPT.
