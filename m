	That does not matter. Once you lawfully acquire it, you automatically have
the (transferrable!) right to use it. Really. Otherwise, as I said, I could
put my copyrighted poem up on billboards (along with a license if you want)
and then sue everyone who read it.

	In the United States, the license, to be valid, must be a condition of
obtaining lawful possession of the copyrighted work. If you disagree, please
feel free to cite cases where this argument was raised and rejected.
