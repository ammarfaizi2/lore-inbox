You can't assume that. The big problem is right now nobody has set an
agreed location for kernel sources, you also cant assume they will be
present.

Its something the FHS needs to address eventually (where eventually is sooner
not later)

Nope. They are due to bugs in the kernel source. The bug in question is
intentionally left in the kernel sources to handle issues with older modutils.
Keith posted 2.4.x patches to drop support for older modutils and in doing so
remove the warning.
