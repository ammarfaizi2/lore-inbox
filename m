"I'm an American, I believe in the American Way, I worry if the 
government encourages open source, and I don't think we've done 
enough education of policy makers to understand the threat."


He believes in the "Golden Rule" too...

Can you say "NSA" or "Secure Linux"?

I believe they are truly worried.  It's all about money and control,
both of which they are leaking badly.

I have faith in the policy makers at large.  A certain judge
understood M$'s policy all to well.  A lot of parallels can be drawn
between this latest volley and their current legal predicament.

I'm rambling, but this has got me a bit upset.
