Sorry, wrong answer, but thanks for playing.  Multics was not abandoned as
unusable, and was, in fact, widely used, sometimes in what would now be
called "mission critical" applications, for a long time. While Honeywell
finally stopped supporting Multics sometime in the 90s, I was surprised and
delighted to find that there are still Multics systems running.

There may be many people on this list who know the history of Unix, but from
this thread, I'm thinking that perhaps there is some confusion between the
history and the mythology.

Perhaps we could get AT&T, Lucent, or whomever owns the copyright these
days, to reprint the "Unix" issue of the Bell Systems Journal.

Multics???  No way. It was abandoned as unusable and part of the
kernel code, basically the boot loader, was modified to become
part of Unix.

You have way too many persons on this list who know the history of
Unix to try this BS.
