most likely you never needed to violate a NDA in favor of the legal truth,
but be assured: nobody can force you to obey a contract which will make you
lie or keep illegal methods secret. Actually most often, you can be held
liable for knowning about it.

And this is totally unrlated to NDAs in academics vs. NDAs in commercial
business.
