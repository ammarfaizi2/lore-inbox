Well, just about the only thing that has impact on your reputation is yourself
and the way you are dealing with _own_ deficiencies. Your reputation (if ever)
has not been built by SuSE, and it is not destroyed by SuSE.

As long as you deny that there is always someone with more knowledge on the net
that is capable of unveilling your faults you will always enter troubles here.
It's all about learning and only very seldom about being god.
