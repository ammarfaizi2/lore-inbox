I know all this, see my very first point above. I just can't see the real
practical value. I'd more than likely find a Palm more productive, as it's
simple, does one task, and does it well. If I wanted to buy a PDA, I'd get a
Palm. If I wanted to buy a miniature laptop, I'd get a PictureBook or
somesuch. I just can't see the practical use.
