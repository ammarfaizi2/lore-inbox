Greetings;

I've noticed all day that I cannot get to weather.com, and I've only 
rx'd 3 messages from the list since about 14:00 my time, midnight 
now.  Not even my own posts are coming back.

Ingo Molnar, if you are copying the mail, that 
2.6.10-rc2-mm3-V0.7.31-3 kernel I built this morning is still up, no 
problems so far.  Sweet is the best description I can give it right 
now.

-- 
Cheers, Gene
