Be respectful on l-k?  I wouldn't dare to step outside of the norm :)
No, I'm not respectful of software ideology because it takes valuable time
that we can spend arguing about meaningless and off-topic technical
subjects instead.

} When you use the term "license religion", you are in fact saying "If
} someone has philosophical objections then those people are irrational
} zealots and their objections and philosophical beliefs are baseless".
} That's not very respectful...

Then you have no problem, right?  You'll still be able to use your
patches and others will be able to use BK.  Your compaint seems to be about
what others choose to use when working on the kernel.  Some ideology is
well placed when discussing matters of the kernel but what tools people use
to work on it is going way too far.

} Problem?  Well partly I just can't be assed to use the thing because
} I'm comfortable with my own scripts and all revision control systems
} just get in your face and suck.  But also because I'm here to improve
} the body of public software, and at the end of the day, any support
} which I put into bitkeeper won't help there.  (using == supporting).
