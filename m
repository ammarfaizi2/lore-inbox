I need some help, I'm new to this.  I have compliled a 2.5.39 kernel for my quad pentium pro system and it is oopsing on bootup.  Unfortunently, it looks like a good portion of the oops scrolls off of the screen.  Since I don't have the ability to hook up a serial terminal, how do I capture this oops so I can report it?

Thanks,

Chris
