We all know what will happen, because we have played this game a thousand
times before: he won't answer. He simply is not interested in a
clearification of the situation. 

I know of not a single company besides FSM-Labs who does not answer if you
have questions about the use of their products but points you to a lawyer. 

Lately I've talked to some people from a German company who has even
contacted FSM-Labs, because they want to use RTAI for a product and wanted
to be sure if they needed to buy a patent license or not. Even that
potential FSM-Labs customer was roughly told to ask a lawyer.
