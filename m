Hi there,

Well, I own a centrino laptop and that pisses me off too, but hey, they have
the power to do that, and I have to hang with this laptop, so...

In the meanwhile, we have LinuxAnt who developed a proggie that emulates
Windoze drivers to Linux... They say it supports our wireless card, I saw
people successfully use it, and many more that can't (as myself). It sure can
communicate with the card, so you can give it a try...

Hoping that I've someway helped,

Mind Booster Noori
