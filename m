This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.11.3 release.  There
are 11 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to this one.
If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let us know.  If
anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants to add a
signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.

These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Bcc: line.
If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@linux.com to add your name to
the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list, also email us.

Responses should be made by Sat, March 12, 23:00 UTC.  Anything received after
that time, might be too late.

thanks,

the -stable release team (i.e. the ones wearing the joker hat in the corner...)
