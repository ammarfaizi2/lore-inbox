This is about Monta Vista Software, a company that develops software for
embedded platforms, based on the Linux kernel and (possibly) other GPL
software.

In its official FAQ page, http://www.mvista.com/products/faq.html#q9 , it
says:

"A: The GNU General Public License (GPL) is very specific about the 
obligations imposed on developers leveraging Open Source. If you 
deploy/redistribute program binaries derived from source code licensed  
under the GPL, you must


 Supply the source code to derived GPL code or Make an offer (good for 3
years) to supply the source code
 
 Retain all licensing / header information, copyright notices, etc. in
those sources
 
 Redistribute the text of the GPL with the binaries and/or source code
 
 Note that your obligation is strictly to the recipients of binaries
(i.e., your customers). You have no responsibility to the "community" at
large."





	Its the last sentence that is of concern. Does this mean no 3rd
party (who is not a customer) can get the GPL source code part of their
products ? Seems like a GPL violation of clause 3b in
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html .

In addition:

1. There is no linux kernel source in ftp://ftp.mvista.com/

2. The download page http://www.mvista.com/previewkit/index.html does not
claim to offer any source code at all.
