Umm, john.. He IS right. I've been following the linux kernel list for
QUITE some time, though actively asking questions on it for the last 2
months. I've read through the docs in /usr/src/linux/Documentation/* and i
hear one more person tell me to "read the source" I'll go nuts. 

SOURCE CODE ONLY MAKES SENSE TO THOSE THAT EITHER WROTE IT OR WORK WITH IT
EVERYDAY!

And don't tell me "Well, then you shouldn't be touching the kernel if
you're not a developer" because that's crap too.


Simply put, with all bitterness and finger pointing aside, WHERE do we
find information on various kernel functions, their general usage (as in
the WHY, not only the HOW) and reasonings on why not to use some
vs. others.

Remember, most of you guys have been coding for years, or working on the
kernel for years. Some of us don't have that level of expertise, are
trying to get it, and feel like we're being told that information is a
private domain we aren't allowed in to.


Me personally, I'd be happy with a list of all the finctions in the linux
kernel, a brief description of their usage and a singl elink on where to
find more info about that particular function.


Just my 2 cents worth.
