This has nothing to do with Larry personally.   The point is that some
people keep saying BK is better without stopping to think if the supposed
advantages are honestly needed.   They come with a rather large cost of
reducing some people to second class participants and reducing the freedom
to use collected metadata.   Since svn or arch could fill the role quite
nicely without these problems, it makes you wonder if the price of BK is
too high for whatever advantage it provides over these other choices.  
Unfortunately the decision has already been made, so this is all academic.
