You seem to have been inexplicably excluded from "a quarter century of unix" 
by peter salus.  (You're not in the index, anyway.)  Haven't read "life with 
unix" yet...

I'm a little fuzzy on how that would really improve things...  It still 
wouldn't have enough memory to run anything except the shell.  (Ummm...  You 
skipped running the shell and booted straight to your app as process 1?)

Sounds cool.  Who's Plessey?  (What was DEC selling at about that time?  I 
take it they hadn't made the jump to IC dram yet?)

Had anybody actually HEARD of Intel at this time?  They seem to be a no-name 
fringe DRAM player until the 4004.  Their retroactive history makes it seem 
quite noble, but I'm still not sure who they actually sold their DRAM -TO-...

Okay, a quid's a pound?  (You are referring to the cost of the DRAM here?)  I 
have no idea what the exchange rate was back about then...

How many different departments shared this box?  What kind of things were 
done on it?

Ken Thompson would know, he sent out the tapes.

Peter Salus's book just says (page 70), "The United Kingdom, which had 
received Unix in 1973..."

Sigh...

I thought Tanenbaum worked at Bell Labs?  (Did he just visit, or did he move 
to europe after leaving the BTL?)

And I'm writing a book about it. :)
