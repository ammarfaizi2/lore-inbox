same question from me, too. recalling, that there were ready 
patches, and feature freeze is comming. i think also, that this is
one of the substantional features to go in 2.5, 'cause it's needed
for the new bttv 0.8.x driver, the one and only (of bttv), that has 
further developement. or isn't enough request?
