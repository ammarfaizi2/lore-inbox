I have an ASUS motherboard with an Athlon TBird (don't remember all the
model numbers, etc.) and I had problems with the *display* power management
using Red Hat 7.1. I just got 7.2 and haven't had a chance to check whether
it works there or not. Never tried to do power management on the box itself
though.
