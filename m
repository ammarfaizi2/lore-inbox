I agree.  What usually seems to end up happening is that someone
writes 95% and gets no credit, someone else does 5% and puts in a
printk announcing their contribution loudly every time the system
boots.  I recall that the old PPP driver used to print "PPP Dynamic
channel allocation code copyright 1995 Caldera, Inc." which always
annoyed me because it was a completely trivial piece of code that the
notice was referring to.
