You might want to check to see if TCP_ECN (Explicit Congestion
Notification) is enabled.  Many of the later Linux 2.4.x kernels enable
it automatically if it's compiled in (I don't know if this is still the
case or not), and some OSes simply refuse all connections whose SYN
packets are marked this way.

I wouldn't be terribly surprised if the a recent version of IE6 changed
the default TCP settings to make Windows not work with it.

The simple way to check is:

   cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn

If it's a "1", then it's enabled, if "0" or you get a file not found, that
isn't the problem.
