"Bat-Boy creates open-source project"

After defeating the evil-doers of the world Bat-Boy has taken up another
cause - titanic software companies.  He vows to tirelessly create
sourceforge.net projects one after another until the sheer weight of them
collapses onto, and crushes, Microsoft.

"What's our business model?", asked Bat-Boy through a translator.  "I eat
vermine and insects so I don't need much money.  When I do need money, I
sell photos of myself to tabloids".

Bat-Boy, you do us all proud!

} Even tabloids can have good content, though I agree it's rare.
} After watching all the dot com and open source companies take a
} dive when it became apparent that no business model == no business,
} it's somewhat nice to see someone besides myself trying to figure out
} an answer which is actually sustainable.  It's not an enjoyable thing,
} everyone hates you if you don't work all day long on their problems
} for free, but it's a good topic for further thought.
} 
} I think that the guy is on the right track, I've frequently described
} software sales as similar to insurance, noone pays what it actually costs
} to handle the problem, everyone pays a little and the cost is spread
} out over everyone.  The more people who pay, the less each has to pay,
} and that seems to be his message.  I agree with that.  He's basically
} right in theory, the problem is putting it into practice looks hard
} or impossible.  But maybe someone will figure out a way, so I'm
} trying to be encouraging.
} 
} Consider this my obligatory, once a year, "that's a good idea" post.
} Intended to balance out the zillion other posts saying "that's braindead".  :)
