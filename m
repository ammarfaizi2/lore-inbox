Subject: 2.6.3-rc?: ALSA - xmcd works, xmms & aplay don't.

Hi all,

I've been going bats lately with the recently releases of Linux,
trying to get ALSA up and working again, or at least any part of my
sound card besides the input from the CDROM.  

I've got a Dell Precision, 610 MP, dual 550mhz PIIIs, 768mb RAM,
Debian Unstable/Testing installed.  currently running 2.6.3-rc2 with
the config at the end of the file.  I can start up xmcd and alsamixer,
setup the sound card:

   03:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq ES1371 [AudioPCI-97]
   (rev 06)

And I can control the sound volume without any problems using the ALSA
modules, either with or without the OSS modules included.  And either
with ALSA as modules, or completely builtin to the system.  

But god help me if I try to play any sound using either
xmms-1.2.9-pre1 (or 1.2.8) or any of the alsa utils like 'aplay'
version 1.0.2.   I just downloaded and installed: alsa-driver-1.0.2,
alsa-lib-1.0.2, alsa-oss-1.0.2, alsa-utils-1.0.2; and none of it has
helped.

I don't get any error output from xmms, but the disks start cycling
with a constant chk chk chk noise, and the interactivity of the system
goes down the drain.  It's really quite sucky, as is interactivity
when I'm downloading large files and compiling as well.  Even with a
dual CPU system, it just lags alot.

Anyway, the big issue is that I can't get ALSA to play sound, even
though I know the card works, and I've had it working once before
under 2.6.x, but not any more.  

Here's the output from aplay, when I try to send out a song:

    > aplay -v mp3/yes/90125/owner_of_a_lonely_heart.mp3

So any help or suggestions on how to debug this would be really
appreciative.

Thanks,
John
