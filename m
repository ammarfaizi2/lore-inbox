I have a 2460 that runs rock solid.  I does not warm reboot, but then it
doesn't reboot from Windows either.  I've heard that a bios upgrade
fixes the warm reboot issue.  I loaded it pretty hard for days at a
time, and never a hitch, except for the warm boot problems.  Are you
sure the ones you've had problems with had MPs and not XPs in them?
