You say you have observed for a long time a problem.

The only person participating in this thread who is one of the 
networking maintainers is Patrick McHardy.

Did _he_ say this was a known and unfixable problem?

He wanted to help you and you pissed him off because you refuxed to give 
him dmesg, .config and other information that would have helped him to 
debug your problem. If you don't feel obliged to help the persons 
responsible for the part of the kernel you have a problem with to debug 
your problem your whole initial mail was pointless.
