DEAR FRIEND,
PLEASE READ MY PROPOSAL QUICKLY AND LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN HANDLE THIS. I WAS GIVEN YOUR LINK 
BY AN ASSOCIATE IN THE BANKING SECTOR. I WORK IN THE CSU DEPT OF A FINANCIAL BODY. I OVERSEE 
AND CONTROL THE PAPER WORK OF ALL DEPOSITS. I HAVE BEEN ON THE CASE OF A CERTAIN MR MUSHI 
VASWANI WHO WAS A BIG CONTRACTOR HERE BUT HAS  DIED YEARS AGO. HE MADE LARGE DEPOSITS OF 
FUNDS AND VALUABLES AND FROM WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT, HE LIVED A FAST LIFE WITH NO WIFE OR 
CHILD EVEN AS AT 51 BEFORE HE DIED OF LUNG CANCER DUE TO HEAVY SMOKING. TAKE MY WORD, THESE 
DEPOSITS ARE NOT SMALL MONIES. THE PLAN IS, I NEED A FOREIGNER TO ACT AS THE HEIR TO THIS 
MAN, IF YOU FOLLOW MY ALREADY CAREFULLY LAID OUT PLANS I CAN HAVE ALL THE DEPOSITS MOVED TO 
YOUR ACCOUNT IN A FEW DAYS.
TO SHOW YOU I AM NOT DESPERATE AND ALSO NOT FORCING OR DECEIVING YOU INTO THIS, MY INITIAL 
CONDITION IS THAT WE KEEP THIS WITHIN OURSELVES AND DISCUSS EXTENSIVELY TO MAKE SURE WE ARE 
BOTH CLEAR AND ALSO PROOVE TO YOU THAT THIS IS NOT A JOKE OR SCAM.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP SO I CAN AVAIL YOU WITH THE DETAILS.
MY REGARDS,
JOHN ALTON.
