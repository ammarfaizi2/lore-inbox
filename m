I'm trying to use a Keyspan USA-19 to enable access to a Palm m500 on a
serial cradle.  Whenever I try to modprobe the keyspan module I get the
message "Warning: /lib/modules/2.4.5/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.o
symbol for parameter vendor not found"... the module loads anyway, but
doesn't seem to detect the device.

As far as I can see, everything seems to be setup correctly (.config
attached).  Pointers and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanx!
