I have this same problem on both my laptop and my testbox.  It happens
everytime and I have yet to compile 2.5.4 successfully.  Although, I suspect
it's in my config file - I'm just using an old config file I used for my
2.4.17 kernel which works just fine.

Hi,

It seems nobody having this problem? No one replies at
least why, so I just want to add one more case of
compiling error. Exactly the same message as yours.
