AFAIK "software" is just the complementary concept of "hardware". 
Hardware is hard, ie, the parts of anything you can touch. Software is 
the *information* part of anything. In the case of a table, hardware are 
the wood, nails, nuts and bolts that make the table and software is the 
design of the table, the recipy of the resin used to coat it, etc. In 
the case of a computer, hardware is the boards, case, monitor and 
software is all the information used to make the thing work, including 
all programs and all data contained in it.
