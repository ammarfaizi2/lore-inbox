But you don't attach strings about naming in GPL, so you are SOL respect
FSF owned software. The owners of the other bits of the operating systems
(wide sense, otherwise called "distributions") usually called "Linux"
(independently GPLed, BSD stuff, X11, Knuth (TeX), in-house installation
and configuration tools, ...) have no such naming restrinctions AFAIK, and
have not complained either, even less in your direction.

What is discussed here is the operating system (narrow sense, i.e., kernel
only) called Linux, on which you have no claim whatsoever.
