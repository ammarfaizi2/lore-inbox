Hi,
Sorry for bothering you.

I am trying to learn about linux character device drivers. I was going
through videodev.c. Can someone tell me which all are the devices that
come under video devices and also the ".c" files. Can someone tell me
which driver is the simplest under /usr/src/linux/drivers/char so that I,
as a beginner can understand the driver concept better.

Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
sathish.j
