I was recompiling my router tonight and decided to compile in frame
buffer support since I hate the standard 640x480 screen.  Though low and
behold it fails at the final link with the error of:

built-in.o: 
local symbols in discarded section .text.exit

Once I removed that from my config it compiled cleanly, once I reboot
with this kernel I am going to get the exact error and reply to this
post.. be back in a few...
