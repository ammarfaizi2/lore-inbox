Hello, I have two days ago, this message:
Kernel bug at kernel/sched.c 2579!
invalid operand 0000[#1]
PREEMPT
Tainted with nvidia, but I'm working on console, cp, find and some text 
editors, not on X.

And I can't use sysreq keys, they doesn't work with this screen And my syslog 
doesn't log anything.

Cause I don't have my digital camera, and this error does not happen again in 
a week of hard working with kernel 2.6.12 (3 days) - > 2.6.12.1 (3 days), I 
need to know how can I grab it, if sysreq doesn't work. is neccesary to use 
Serial ports logging?

cheers
