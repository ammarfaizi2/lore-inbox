Yes, marc's "download raw" is a godsend.  Unfortunately, marc's search 
isn't very good, so I sometimes find myself searching one of the 
hypermail archives just to find the date/time/author then getting the 
raw download from marc.

It would be nice to see an official corporate sponsor step up to the 
plate to provide funding for a really definitive archive site.  Two 
features I'd like to see:

  - Google-quality archive search engine
  - Download multiple messages in mbox format for offline reading
