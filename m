	Hello Alan ,  I do not know about modern disk media .  But I had a
	Seagate st501 drive that sat shelved for 5 years & put it back
	into the micro-pdp11/23 & booted fine .  I ran that for ~ another
	year for a small project I was involved in .  I would hope that
	more modern media would have better shelf life than that even ?-)
		Twyl ,  JimL
