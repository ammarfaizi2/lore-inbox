Major change this week only, please note!

Due to complaints about the restrictions of a phone conference
Andrew and I have decided to move the 2.6 must-fix discussion to irc.

The server we will use is: irc.oftc.net 
 (NOT irc.freenode.net as previously stated)

The channel is: #lse

If you need help getting started with irc see this helpful 
site at: http://irchelp.org or feel free to send me email for help.

The agenda and time remain the same:

	LSE Tech IRC meeting Wednesday May 14

Andrew Morton: The 2.6 must fix list.
