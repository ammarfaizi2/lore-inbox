It's down, ha ha, Microsoft is down!  I'm joking of course.  But you don't
know how many times my techs have told me that.  It's either that, or
something is seeming a little strange on our network, and to trouble
shoot, they ping microsoft.com and don't get a responce.  Then they call
me at home, to tell me that our T1s are down.

I wonder how much bandwidth was used up by people pinging MS to trouble
shoot when they still allowed ICMP packets through.
