That is nice to hear.

   This project is Intel Lab's software reference implementation of
   iSCSI. *SEE README FOR COMPATIBLE VERSIONING IN EACH RELEASE*
     * Development Status: 3 - Alpha
     * Intended Audience: Developers
     * License: BSD License
     * Natural Language: English
     * Operating System: Linux
     * Programming Language: C
     * Topic: System

That BSD only nicely keeps it out of Linux!
