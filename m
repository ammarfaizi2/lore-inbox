It's not about facts, it's not about the truth, it's not about Jim
Allchin being an idiot or deluded. It's about propaganda,
misinformation, and marketing. It's about business. Nothing new, nor
unexpected. And to the comment "It is not American to steal", well,
it may not be "American", but it's for sure been part of the way of
doing business in this country for years. It's not right, it's not
ideal, but it IS the way it's done in too many cases.
