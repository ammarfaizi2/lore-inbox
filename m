Well, I don't know about "equal" but many
webservers have benefitted from the tux
related kernel enhancements - yes I know
about X15, I tested it out too...

It's fast, but tux is faster.

Granted -

So, just out of curioisity, why is khttpd in
the kernel? If there were any web server
in the mainline kernel I'd think it'd be tux -
