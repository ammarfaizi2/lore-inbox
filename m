My employer sells servers and neither includes keyboards nor=20
monitors nor mouses. These are extras, since my employer considers
servers "unattended machines" and you either have a KVM switch or
can rip a KVM-set off some work station, if you have a hardware failure.

If you don't have a KVM set at hand, our service team brings it in.

So you just need to change to a sane vendor and can exclude that kind
of costs[1] in the next contract.

[1] Just consider the deposit and recycling costs, maintence costs,=20
    storage space costs, inventory costs and so on. This all adds
    up dime by dime for a good amount of servers.
