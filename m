Yes, and not by me.  By the people who wrote it.

The first thing I heard, from mec two years ago, was "the CML1 code
base is not salvageable".  This was then and is now the unanimous opinion of
the kbuild team.  Not just mine; in fact, they concluded it before
I entered the picture.

I have seen nothing since to make me change that opinion.
