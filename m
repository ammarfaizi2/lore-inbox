Subject: 2.2.18pre19 oops in try_to_free_pages
Message-ID: <20001128134418.C54301@niksula.cs.hut.fi>

This is a dual Pro200. Running mainly oracle. The kernel is a 2.2.18pre19
+ide-patch. The oops was unfortunately mangled by sysklogd, but I did try
to reconstruct it. Sysklogd apparently used the wrong System.map (the
redhat default one I had accidentally left in /boot). I tried to map the
addresses back and re-lookup them from the correct System.map. Do the
addresses I got make any sense?

After the opps, the box had locked up solid (in XFree dmps state), and I
had no way of reading the oops from console. The machine did not react to
any key combination and the networking was dead.

The current 2.2.18pre vm seems very unstable to me. This is the second
machine I'm having serious trouble with it (out of three boxes I'm running
2.2.18pre on). Please consider something for the 2.2.18 final (I haven't
heard Alan comment on the Andrea's VM-global patch?). Anyway, I'm going to
try Andrea's vm-global-7 now. It seems to include the bits Rik posted, or
am I mistaken?

BTW: What are those seemingly harmless "VFS: busy inodes on changed
media." messages I'm getting tons of?
