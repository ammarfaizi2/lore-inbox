I didn't mean game AI.  In real life, computers aim better than humans 
do.  In real life, that makes people want the AI, in a game, when the 
robot is faster they don't buy the game.

I predict the US military will drive AI research over the next 10 years 
because AIs can shoot better and faster.  After the AIs mature on the 
battlefield they'll start being more useful to industry (replacing bus 
drivers, etc.)

In 15-30 years, AIs will be a big market, a huge one.  Of course, people 
said that 30 years ago and it seemed reasonable then....
