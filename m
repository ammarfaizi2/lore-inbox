My understanding (going back to the 80s) is that the correct term is
disc. "disk" is short for diskette. (discette would be pronounced as
"dissect" (think miscellaneous), so "diskette" was used instead.

So, when referring to a 3.5" or 5.25" floppy, "disk" would be correct
since they are diskettes. However, a "hard drive" is very much a disc
(or nowadays a group of discs). A "hard disc" would refer to one of
the constituents of a "hard drive".

Regards,

/Mike
