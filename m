Hi 

  I would like to know if there is any support in the 2.4.x kernels for
Adaptec SCSI RAID ASR-2100S cards. It seems that one can download a driver
or patch from Adaptec website for 2.2.x kernels...
 Can someone point me for any patch or driver available for the 2.4
series?

  Thanks in advance for any info.
  Best regards

   C. Martins
