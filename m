Hi,

i am getting 

Nov  4 21:50:22 napalm kernel: Adding Swap: 48188k swap-space (priority -1)
Nov  4 21:50:25 napalm kernel: fbcon_setup: No support for fontwidth 12
Nov  4 21:50:25 napalm kernel: fbcon_setup: type 0 (aux 0, depth 8) not supported
Nov  4 21:50:25 napalm kernel: fbcon_setup: No support for fontwidth 12
Nov  4 21:50:25 napalm kernel: fbcon_setup: type 0 (aux 0, depth 8) not supported
...

when using tdfx framebuffer driver on voodoo3 pci with SUN12x22 font.
But, the driver and the font (nice font, really) is working just fine.
So ... where is the magic ? I bet that >8 font width wasn't supported but
now it is.

.config attached

Thanks,

Jan Dvorak <johnydog@go.cz>
