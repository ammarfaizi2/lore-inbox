I think it is nice to have the names.  A new kernel
might break something,  It is then nice to know
where to send the bug report. (It is usually, but not
necessarily the maintainer that did it.)

That's why I like a long format, merely with the
_duplicated_ names removed.  I guess people
like to see their name in the changelog too. :-)
