One fact that is often missed by armchair evolutionists is that evolution is 
not random.  It's controlled by a mechanism (most obviously: gene shuffling) 
and the mechanism *itself* evolves.  That is why evolution speeds up over 
time.  There's a random element, yes, but it's not the principle element.

The fact that Linux has evolved from nothing to what it is in a mere 10 years 
- 30 if you count the 20 years of Unix that came before it - is due entirely 
to the fact that Nature has evolved a very efficient mechanism (us) to guide 
Linux's evolution.

Sure, once you are better than the other guy you're going to eat his lunch.  
But time does matter: a critter that fails to get its evolutionary tail in 
gear before somebody eats its lunch isn't going to get a second chance.
