	Ah... Found out what happened.  They weren't getting dumped in a spam
folder (unless you consider LKML a spam folder :-) ).  All of your
messages included LKML in the cc and my procmail scripts obligingly
dumped all of them in my LKML folder.  And I'm just a few thousand
messages behind on that one ATM.  :-(  Sorry about that.  On it now.
Guess I need to "fine tune" that procmail receipe.
