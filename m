Anybody know where the source rpm for UnitedLinux kernel is?
[to be distinguished from kernel-source rpm]

AFAICS they are not distributing source code to their published kernel
binaries...  which is a very obvious GPL violation.

I'm also surprised the even-more-pro-GPL-than-me people have not jumped
on UnitedLinux for not distributing source code.

	Jeff, looking for useful [rumored] drivers/net patches
