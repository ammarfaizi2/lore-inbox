You are mixing free beer and free speech. Of course I'm free to use it
in the device I purchased, but it is nevertheless unsuitable for the
Debian main archive, where there is only free software.

Of course it is. If the proposed solution is technically better and
pleases the so-called zealots, why are you discussing it at all?
