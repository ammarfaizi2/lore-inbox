Trouble or not. We will defeat this garbage. I will not allow any or my
(Canada) country to tell me how to control my own systems let alone my
own hardware! 

Let them pass it, they won't be able to enforce it. I won't let my Linux
kernel become 'tainted' by closed binary drivers and I will really
actively get involved in defeating such measures in Linux kernel
modules.
