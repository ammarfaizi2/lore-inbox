I still have hardcopies of pre-BSD Network UNIX (ca. 1975) if that's helpful.
That goes back to when there were about four UNIX machines on the ARPANet.
Let me know if it would help (albeit i'll want the originals back as i think
it's my only copy of the original 'pty.c' [which was based on the PDP-10
pseudo-teletype drivers at Stanford and MIT, thus was neither Bell nor BSD
code]).
