Provided it's kept up-to-date. I.e. it calls for some tools (and these
require the suggested changes).

I'll only object that imvvvvho there is no global problem here:
* If user meets a serious problem, the maintainer will surely ask
him to test some fix, to specify some point or whatever. Thanks to
System, user will save 5 or 10 minutes. To be compared to the time spent
with said maintainer or preparing the bug report.
* If user don't know how to submit and don't use some exotic driver, I bet
he will start by posting to l-k and be eventually redirected.
* If user has identified problem with his FooBar SS6 adapter, chances
are that he knows who he should reach.

I have no problem with it but I'm not sure it's *really* useful.
