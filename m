Stallman is a lonely, homely, pot-smoking atheist who has spent the last 20 years of his life fighting the free enterprise system with his own tax-exempt organization, the Free Software Foundation, Inc., and a project he calls "GNU" (pronounced g-NEW).  As a BA graduate in Physics, he continuously demonstrates that he does not grasp basic economic concepts, like the cost of research and development, by trying to convince everyone to give their software away for free.

Stallman sounds like a great guy from the way you describe him (by the
way, no one is lonely on the internet, and there are advantages to
living alone if indeed that is how he lives -- I miss that kind of
lifestyle).  By the way, If you're using the Linux Kernel, you can thank
folks like Stallman (and people like  Linus Torvalds who chose to  use
his license for their work) for allowing you free access to their own
research and development, only asking in exchange that if you use their
research and development, that in return you share your own research and
development that you do with it back with them and hence with the rest
of the world.

That is, if it was fair for you to use their work for free, then it's
fair the other way around.  If you don't want to share your work, then
you shouldn't use their tools.  That's why microsoft exists.  Use 
microsoft compilers and tools if you want to build proprietary
technologoies on properietary operating systems.
