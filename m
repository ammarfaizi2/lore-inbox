The LPAT is a demanding but fair test reflecting the tasks of a program=
mer or analyst.

The LPAT is a test that measures a job applicant's potential rather tha=
n his/her knowledge of a specific computer language.  It helps you comp=
are your applicants with each other and with national norms.

The LPAT provides accurate, quantified, systematic information about yo=
ur candidates=92 mental abilities, going beyond what resumes, GPAs and =
interviews can tell you.

Upon completion of the test, a score report is produced with an overall=
 score and with sub-scores.=20
