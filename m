Look, for those of you who love their beloved netware, go back and use 
it. You don't like the way the unix filesystems work because you don't 
UNDERSTAND how they work. You're talking about a bunch of special-case 
stuff here -- POSIX ACLs and SELinux are your answer. Use them. But for 
christ's sake, STOP BITCHING ABOUT NETWARE.
