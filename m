Hello,
My name is Mrs.Jennifer Wilson I am a dying woman who had decided to donate 
what I have to you. I am 59 years old and was diagnosed for
cancer about 2 years ago,immediately after the death of my husband, who had 
left me everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate from 
what I have inherited from
my late husband to the you for the good work of God,rather than allow my 
relatives to use my husband's hard earned funds ungodly.I  have asked God to 
forgive me all my sins and i believe he has
because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation,and i pray 
that i survive the operation. I have decided to WILL/donate the sum of 
$1,500,000(One million five
hundred thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and to help 
the motherless,less privileged and also for the assistance
of the widows.At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls, due to the 
fact that my relatives are around me and i have been restricted by my
doctor from taking telephone calls because i deserve all thee rest i can 
get.Presently,I have informed my lawyer about my decision in
WILLING this fund to you.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless 
you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good 
work to
others. Kindly Contact my lawyer through this email address 
(brownwalter01@hotmail.com)if you are interested in carrying out this
task,so that he can arrange the release of the funds ($1,500,000.00) to 
you.My lawyer's name is Brown Walter.
I know I have never met you but my mind tells me to do this,and i  hope you 
act sincerely.
NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter
until the task is accomplished,as I don't want anything that will
Jeopardize my last
wish, due to the fact that i do not want relatives or family members
standing in the way of my last wish.
love,
Jennifer Wilson
