This (2) was my opinion also, and when you read the FAQ, it becomes 
apparent that as far as srcs are concerned, you are more of less expected 
to search the net and find the src for a rather lengthy list of binaries 
that are on the dvd.  This doesn't quite seem to fit my understanding that 
*they* should be supplying the src, they are not, or at least thats what I 
have read and interpreted the FAQ as saying.

To Harold W., this thread is re the former "k-linux" distro, which has been 
renamed and is now being sold for 299 euros on their website, with no 
functional download links.

This will be my last post on this since its off-topic for lkml.
