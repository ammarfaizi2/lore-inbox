Why so?

I  personally prefer to  call  the system GNU/Linux,  will continue to
call it so (when  referring to the  system as a  whole and not to  the
kernel) but I feel that such discussion  is Off Topic for this mailing
list.  Although I'm violating my intention not to pollute linux-kernel
any more than it is already, I feel that  your conclusion is a bit too
far  fetched.   Besides, I  don't think   all  contributors to the GNU
project  and  all  the persons  which   call the system GNU/Linux  are
subscribed to this mailing list.

bye,

andrea
