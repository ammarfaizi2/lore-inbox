The issue is not *value* it's *price*.

We have no funky licenses here. If it's free we use it, if we buy it we
use it. Anything which has a license which is free for one thing and not
another just isn't used. It's too easy for someone to use the software in
violation and we're not comfortable risking that. Price of painful
honesty and legal paranoia.

If you think I wouldn't use bk other than the license, I bet you think I
don't drive a Bentley because I don't notice it's nicer than my old Ford.
This isn't a technical issue.
