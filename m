He probably means that some features are unnecesary and, are threatening to turn the kernel into bloatware, I cant talk though, I use IE 3 under wine...

Cheers, Dean.

So lemme guess, you calling "embedded" == "Mozilla" ?
This is the reason those developers do not submit patches and fixes?
Under that rational, why not unplug the support for the embedded archs?
This follows your line of reasoning perfectly?
So you are proposing to unbloat the kernel by not fixing and patch archs
which embedded people depend on?
Thus letting then rot and die then final removal of baggage?
