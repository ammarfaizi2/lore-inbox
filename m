I don't have most of platform to test. sure it's easy to just convert
them using romfs_get_size() but I don't wanna submit any patch that I
can't test.

So, if the patch is not that bad, it'd be much easier to just tell all
platform maintainer that the infra. is in place and they can start
converting their code to use new function.

Anyway I just converted uclinux.c to use romfs_get_size(). Greg, would
you kindly comment on the attached patch?
