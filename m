I have had great success with the 2.4.x series of kernels so far.  I am
using 2.4.1.  However, with 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 (haven't tried the pre for 2
yet), I have been having tulip networking cards up the wazoo.  I turn my
switch off and back on and that seems to help.

Is this a hardware problem or are the drivers a little odd?
