hi all

I apologize if this is more of a support question, but I couldn't find it
anywhere...

How long time may I have to wait for kernel to build a software RAID-5 on
12 18GB 15k SCSI drives? Algorithm is set to left-symmetric and persistent
superblock is 1.

What can be done to speed this up_

thanks

roy
