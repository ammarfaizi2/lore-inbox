That's what I had in mind. But it should also check if the top-of-tree is 
already tagged, and not do anything for that. And it should also hopefully 
have a CVS/Subversion equivalent, just so that people don't feel left out.

I would _suggest_ just exporting the whole top-of-tree tag to some
/sys/kernel/version file (for full bug-reports), but in addition also 
maybe have a small hash of it (just a few characters of noise) in "uname", 
to make module versioning work.

So "uname -r" might print out "2.6.9-a$Uv", but then a

	cat /sys/kernel/version/*

would print out something like

	"kernel" file:
		v2.6.9-a$Uv
	"bk-key" file:
		torvalds@ppc970.osdl.org|ChangeSet|20041021004441|21737
	"date" file:
		Wed Oct 20 22:29:23 PDT 2004

or something (one value per file as usual)
