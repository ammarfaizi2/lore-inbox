Hi,

I want to know how the control flows in Tcp/IP src implemntation i.e,
which part of code calls which others
so that i can make changes to the original implementation.
I know its difficult to answer the question. atleast an outline is sought.
like say within /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4 directory.
If someone has worked on it ur inputs are needed so that i can verify with
my assumptions.

Thank you
vlakshmi
