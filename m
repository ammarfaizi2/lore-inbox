Hi All,
    Thought you might appreciate this story.  I got my Linux Journal
yesterday.  It has a picture from the Incredable Hulk on the front
because the movie was rendered on Linux machines.  I showed it to
my wife and told her that I had helped write the OS that rendered
the movie (I wrote the original Rules.make a long time ago).  She
suggested that I tell my daughter.  I thought that was a good idea
so I did and you should have seen the look on her face (no one can
get excited like an 8 yo can).  She is quite proud of me.  And I
am proud of Linux.

Thanks,

Jim
