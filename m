Nobody benefits from having such a closed mind. While I don't wish to imply
that C++ is 'ready' for general use in the kernel, there is a useful subset
of C++ that might one day be.

See for example http://www.caravan.net/ec2plus/

Oh, and please let us not launch another huge discussion about this subject.
I just want to state that having a closed mind is not going to help us.
