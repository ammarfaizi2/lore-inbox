Not with the right hardware combinations. The four processors is over
kill. I have a multi-desktop system that is dual and it is plenty of
power. With a regular machine just put in two matrox g450 cards and enable
dual head support. Attach 3 extra USB keyboards and 3 USB mice and you
are ready to go. With purpore kernel support of course. So the cost is
no longer a issue.
