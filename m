Hello,

The 8x16 and Sun 12x22 kernel fonts I tried seem to lack some standard 
glyphs necessary to represent the entire ISO-8859-1 charmap; I am talking 
about all accented capital vowels except for 'É'.

This seems to happen in both 2.2.16 as well as in 2.2.18.

Is this intentional? If so, why?

How can I override this behaviour?

Thank you.

Cheers,

Mack Stevenson
