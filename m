I'm told people do actually buy dead hard-drives that are returned for
RMA purposes.  I wonder that they do with them? :)

    if it's bad you should think nothing of taking the dewalt cordless, and
    putting a hole through the platters and the case...

A hole wouldn't suffice, you would best destroy the platters
completely (grid off the surface or melt them down).  Or better still,
both.
