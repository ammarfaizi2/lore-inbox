Hi,

In previous message one pointed out that the help for CONFIG_SHAPER
mentions ftp://shadow.cabi.net/pub/Linux/ as the location for the
configuration utilities. 

CONFIG_NET_RADIO section also mentions it as a place for "Some user-level
drivers for scarab devices which don't require special kernel support".

That host does not exist anymore though.

Anyone knows the new location, if there is one?
