This pretty depends on the ac97 codec chip.
Check what is on your device via /proc/asound/card0/codec97#0/*
files.

The driver code of ali5451 hasn't been changed much since long time
ago.  So I suspect it's rather the mixer setting or breakage in other
place.

You can try 2.6.14 kernel with the latest ALSA driver 1.0.11 (compile
as external modules from alsa-driver-1.0.11 tarball) to check whether
it's a regression of ALSA or elsewhere.
