To all who read this list.  I respect someone's ideology and I respect
a person's need to support his family.  I like Opensource, Linux, etc.,
but I have to work in a Microsoft world at this "present time" 
to support my family.  I have learned to respect people's right to disagree.  
Not everyone will agree with the other's conclusions and there have 
been a number of good points raised on both sides.  Please pause 
and consider them.  If you must disagree, please do it in a respectful 
and business like manner.  When you don't, you are only damaging 
your own argument.  Thanks.

rent. food. clothing. basic necessities and whatnot.

Just a thought.

I begin to smell the exuberance of youthful ideology.

Does anyone have a can of Lysol I can borrow?

BK belongs to bitmover. They can do whatever they want with it. Deal.
