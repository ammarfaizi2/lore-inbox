Would never work with the ac-series.  Not enough time
to form a neural pattern between builds.  There is
a semi-prior art here.  Unix on the Tandem (now Compaq) 
Helix shipped (and maybe still does) with a Neural Net
for system sanity and tuning.  Only problem is that 
the learning period usually exceeds the average time
between installing releases (communications customers).

Now if it was a FAST LEARNER...
