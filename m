*****************
The ATA/ATAPI-6 letter ballot has closed. The results are 18 votes for the
motion, 0 votes against the motion, 0 abstentions, and 2 eligible members
did not vote. 2 yes votes had comments. The motion passes.

I have uploaded e01028r0.doc the official announcement of the vote to
incoming on the FTP site. I have also uploaded e01143r0.doc the editors
proposed resolution of the letter ballot comments. This will be reviewed at
the December meeting.
