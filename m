Hi all.

After far too many months without the facilities to produce them I can
finally report that the Linux Kernel Archive CD-ROM's are now available
again. Details can be found at http://www.memalpha.cx/Linux/Kernel/ as
usual.

I have had several enquiries regarding these CD-ROM's over the months
I've been unable to produce them, and have to apologise for this to all
concerned.

Best wishes from Riley.
