I'm experiencing problems whith kernel 2.5.69. Sometimes, without apparent reason, the image on the screen shrinks.
Usually, this only makes the last line of the screen unreadable, but sometimes it even hangs the system. Sometimes at
boot i get the message "Unknown HZ value! (20) assume 100", i think this is related to my problem, but i don't know
where this message comes from. I have a PPC G3. Anyone can help?
Cheers,
	Daniele
