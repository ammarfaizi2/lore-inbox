To get the source for the Design Patterns book, please send
a message with "send design pattern source" as the subject.
If you want a version that is zipped (instead of tarred),
please use "send zipped" as the subject.  If you want a version
in German, send "send German design pattern source" as the subject.

You can also try ftp to st.cs.uiuc.edu in /pub/patterns/dpcat,
or look at the patterns home page
(http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/patterns/patterns.html)

If you can't get ANYTHING to work, complain to johnson@cs.uiuc.edu.

Thanks!
The source server.
