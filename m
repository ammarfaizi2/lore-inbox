Outlook express is different from outlook.  Outlook doesn't let you
look at the mail headers.  Outlook express doesn't, but doesn't display
them by default (iirc, you need to look at the message properties).

PS, you can't remove Received: headers at source - they are added by
each hop on the mails journey across the Internet.
