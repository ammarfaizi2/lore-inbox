OK, I really forgot. the modem I have is BahnBoostar56k future
which according to my research is equivalent to some elsa-modem
(don't remember which one exactly, but certainly not a winmodem).
recently I tried out the newest version of pppd (2.4.1) and it
still didn't work. maybe I also should mention that I tried to
upgrade the modem's firmware because I hoped to get the promised
56k, but it didn't help. (the connection is too bad?) I don't
know if it would work with the older version, but last I checked
I couldn't even find the firmware-version I'm currently using
on the net for downloading, even less a newer version...

and of course again:
