OK - cool. Sounds like people are happy ;-)

Larry, can I presume that you'll reciprocate, and export whatever you
do to the data in BK in some argument-free format (probably the same
one we export to you)? That's what I was getting at by talking about
GPL style licenses ... perhaps not particularly coherently ;-)

I think the concerns I had about tools going wild are actually fairly
easy to resolve by making it a pull-pull interchange ... don't know
why I was thinking of push models.

Thanks,

M.
