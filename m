| How about a naming policy of something going along this:
| Stag (2.2)
| Wolfling (2.4)
| Beaver (2.6)
| Rooster (2.7)
| Ostrich (2.8)
| Sharkey (2.9)
| Cheetah (3.0)
| 
| And all having names of animals. Like in Croatia, their local currency

The stable releases should have the names of nice non-threatening
herbivores, like beaver, and the development trees should have names of
omnivores. Subreleases can have an adjective prepended, like singing,
dancing, horny, constipated... well, maybe someone else should do the
naming of subversions ;-)

A good job by any name.
