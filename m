But if the if() is already there, there is no need to have an additional
goto in the statement,  My version may even be faster than linus'
version because it may save an extra assembler line of code (the beq or
whatever branch statement generated by the if would do the branch during
the if rather than after the if was evaluated and got to the first
statement which was the goto).  Of course, compiler optimizatoins
probably make that particular point pointless to discuss.

But in this case, the condition was already there..  My point is that if
you don't need a goto, you shouldn't use it.  Whenever there's an
obvious way not to use it, don't.
