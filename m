GEORGE ADAMS AND CO.
LEGAL PRACTITIONERS
LAGOS - NIGERIA

ATTENTION: PRESIDENT/CEO,

Sir,

I am a Solicitor and  Legal Representative  to the
family of  Late General Sanni  Abacha. I have the
instructions of Mrs. Maryam Abacha widow  of the late
General Sanni Abacha to link up a foreign partner for
a possible business relationship/assistance. 

General Sanni Abacha was the former military head of
State Nigeria who died  while in office  on Monday 8th
of June, 1998. Upon the sudden and tragic death of
this man, the new civilian administration started an
intensive exercise to freeze all his bank accounts
both home and abroad as he was confirmed to have
diverted a certain percentage of oil proceeds
totalling US$580M (Five Hundred and Eighty Million
 U. S. Dollars Only) into private bank account
scattered in several countries of the World. About =N=
4.5 Billion (Four Billion, Five Hundred Million Naria)
our local currency was recovered from his official
residence after  his death.

However, the sum of US$38,500.00 (Thirty eight million
five hundred  United Dollars Only)  belonging to the
late general and family which was kept  away with  a 
security company by my client Mrs. Maryam Abacha when
the present government started seizeing and freezing
the bank account of my clients late husband.This money
was arranged and packaged in two trunk boxes and kept
in the security companys vault. This is known to
myself and my client only. 

It is therefore on this note that Mrs. Maryam Abacha
is secretly looking for a trustworthy and
understanding person who will help to receive,
accommodate and safeguard this fund to save them the
calamities of the present clamp down on the Abachas
family or  loosing the money. The Abachas family due
to the urgency of this matter are prepared to part
with 20% of this money to you for your  assistance.

This widow is in serious financial distress and this
is the only hope of the Abachas family as all their
passports and travel documents have been seized by the
Government  while the eldest son Mohammed  is in
detention facing a murder charge. Note that there is
no risk involved as this is  known only  to you,
myself and  my client. 

I will sincerely appreciate your response through my
above  e-mail address. This business is highly 
confidential and therefore should be treated as such.
I await a quick response from you. 

Yours faithfully,

GEORGE ADAMS.
