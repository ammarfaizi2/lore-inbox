You are fixing things and people are giving you shit for it.  People who 
want evidence that making something better is worth doing before they do 
it are....  Sigh.  In the unlikely event that Linus doesn't take your 
fixes directly, I'll take them for reiserfs, just let me know.  ReiserFS 
code is as good as we know how to make it, as a matter of policy, and 
that includes the comments.
