Hey! Watch where you point that flame-thrower!

At the risk of stoking those old fires:
Has anyone looked into getting kgdb working on 2.5?  On any 
architecture?  (I'm mostly interested in XScale, but I thought I'd start 
here in the hope that another arch has done the heavy lifting. ;) )

(Hmm, more Googling yields mention of 2.5.49-mm1, so I'll look into that 
some more.  Agh, it looks like there have been 2 versions of kgdb in the 
-mm series.  More study needed.)

Failing that, I'd grasp at straws such as general advice or other 
pointers. :)

Thanks,

Eli
