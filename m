How good is the linux kernel driver for the Intel gigabit Ethernet
NIC (copper) with the TL82543GC chipset? The card says it's
a "PRO/1000T" server adapter, and it looks like the part
number A19845-003.

The sales guy who is promoting it says this is apparently a new
card and he claims he can get specs from engineering.
Not sure about NDA status.

So my question is... is it worth calling this guy's bluff?

Shawn.
