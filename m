If they had I have a feeling that a billion and 1 coders would've
swarmed upon it and coded something up, or nvidia would've just released
the proper source code.

Unfortunately, I believe they're still sitting comfortably with a
geforce4 up their butts, keeping them nice and warm.

If you want you can send them a nice, polite letter (as angry/emotional
ones are likely to do more harm then good) explaining why you feel the
current state of affairs is wrong and why they should correct it (and
how).

of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
