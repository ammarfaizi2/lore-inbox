Well, let me jump into this thread. I don't live in Bolivia or Colorado, 
but I do live in Brazil.

The fastest computer that I have at my disposal is this one with a Duron 
600MHz processor. My father uses a Pentium MMX 200MHz with 64MB of RAM. 
Unfortunately, for financial reasons, I don't see we upgrading our 
computers too soo.

It is nice to read Alan Cox saying that the Gnome team can make Gnome 
use less memory in the future. I'm anxiously looking forward to that. In 
the mean time, I will be using fluxbox and hoping that other parts of 
the system (libraries etc) don't grow too fast for my computers.

I know plenty of people in the same situation that I am. Given the 
choice of purchasing a book for my education or upgrading my computer, I 
guess that I should spend money on the former.

And the same is true for many of my relatives and friends.
