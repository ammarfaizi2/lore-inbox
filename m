The question then Jeff, is: Since when is this os a democracy, where there 
are voting rights?  The ultimate big red veto for the kernel at least, is 
for Linus to stamp on it, and thats the one that many, if not all, will 
follow.  If the top 50 contributors were to lean on Linus to change his 
mind, giving lucid arguments, he, haveing an open mind might consider it.  
OTOH, given this vote tally, he'd not be foolish enough to buck that, its 
a confirmation of his own feelings.

Unforch, here we all stand (0r sit), preaching to the choir, when its the 
FSF and RMS we need to be subjecting to the sermon by giving them the 
chapter and verse of the book we generally follow.  YMMV of course.
