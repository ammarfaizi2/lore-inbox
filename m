Now we're really off-topic, but hey. I really think that a house
(or..well..somewhere to live), food and health care should be free. Health
care is free in some places in the world (the places where they don't
think that the bigger your wallet is - the better health care you should
get..)

So yep. I really think they can be compared. Those things are
_fundamental_.

But no one will listen, I'm just another left-wing radical... And this
list probaby isn't the right place to discuss those issues..
