And ATARI goofed by not including more than GEM in the ST(e).
Should have used the whole system like the TT and Falcon did.

If you see them, tell them an old STe user thanks them for there
work. Without them I might never have headed to Unix :)

Vielen Dank Herren.

I still have Gemini on a Disk for my STe. The SCSI adaptor died,
so I don't know if the data is still good though.

Then I tried the Minix port MinT (Mint is not TOS :)
and was hooked on Unix. If I could get my SCSI adaptor
fixed/replaced I'd still have my STe running, maybe
even get a memory card (for > 4Meg) and a CPU upgrade
(68000 is slow, get 68030 or 40 like the Falcon)

Then I could run Linux on it (it need that math co-proc)
