Sorry for any format issues, I'm not able to use my normal email client 
right now.

The whole issue here is people who claim that copyright allows them to own 
*any* way to make an NE2000 network card work with linux v2.6. How can you 
say that practical alternative means exist if the claim is that every such 
way is owned?

You can use hardware that's already supported in the kernel. You can use 
other operating systems than Linux. But Static Controls could also have made 
cartridges for other printers or printers from other manufacturers.

The issue is not the complexity of the TLP, the issue is simply that you 
cannot use copyright to get protection that is capable of being expressed in 
functional terms. You cannot own every way to express a functional idea. 
That's what patents are for.
