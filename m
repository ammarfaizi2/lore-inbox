Greetings all;

I bought a Belkin Wireless G card, a pci 802-11 radio of some sort.

The main chip on it wears the label "RTL8185L"

Is there any support for making this a wireless server in the kernel at 
the present time?

I have visions of sticking it in the last pci slot of a box running DD-WRT 
if there is a driver available.

Cheers, Gene
