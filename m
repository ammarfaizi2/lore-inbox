Don't know about you, even my local supermarket has 10-12 microbrews, 
any of the beverage warehouses I can come up with at least 30 brewers 
with a selection of styles each, and most have 4-8 kegs of draft on tap 
for sale by the growler. I go for high-hopped ales, but there are lots 
of other goodies. Not to mention eight brew pubs close and another ten 
within an hour or so.

"Other beer" I believe, I'll even buy "fewer bland beers," but not 
better beer in general. Unless you live in a dry state, of course.
