One of the mantras that get hammered into Microsoft employees
is "Eat your own dogfood."  Which means that people working
at Microsoft should attempt to use the company's products throughout
the day in order to surface problems and give incentive to those
folks to make things better.  Obviously, the "EYODF" work doesn't
kick in until there is some minimal level of functionality.

It may be that Linux/OSS office applications simply aren't 
useful enough yet for anyone to stomach using them throughout
the day.  It would be nice to see more Linux folks eating the
dogfood and making those applications better, though.

For my part, I test Enlightenment, Gnome, XFree86 and Mozilla,
in addition to Linux kernels.
