I have a card that mirrors this one from your list:

Retail name: SATA300 TX4
Chip label: PDC40718-GP  SATAII300
Vendor-Device number: 105a:3d17 (rev 02)

Through testing, I've found linux 2.6.16 and 2.6.17 find the ports in this 
order (the list is ordered by linux detection):

1. silkscreen port 3
2. silkscreen port 2
3. silkscreen port 4
4. silkscreen port 1
