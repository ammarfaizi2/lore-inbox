Hi!

This might be interesting :
I found this announcement on freshmeat :

MOSIX for Linux
   MOSIX is being ported to Linux. MOSIX lets you start a process on one machine, and have it automatically
   and transparently migrated to another one when the load on its "home" machine becomes too high. So you can
   write a massively parallel application just by having your application fork into different processes, they
   will be automatically load-balanced to available machines. It's not quite yet available, but there's some
   preliminary information available here. ( http://www.mosix.cs.huji.ac.il/ )

This really sounds cool, unfortunatelly it is not released yet
( but a version for BSD/OS is ).
