Hi,

Please CC me as I am not subscribed to the list.

Are the kernel developers working on the preemptive kernel in 2.6?

Initially the preempt patch was heavily advertised as one of the new
enhancements for the 2.6 kernel.

What is the current status?  I am not able to find any "detailed"
information about this.

Could someone please summarize the issues and plans for the preempt
patch?



Thanks,
Ernesto
