Trevor,

I really think you guys should start using peyote in your temple rituals, 
you'd have a much better grasp on reality.  Most people do not believe
they are going to be gods when they die, which is what mormonisn 
teaches.  I guess a lot of mormoms think they already are, and act like 
it.

:-)
