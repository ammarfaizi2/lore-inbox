Hello,

I did some tests with bootmem-2.4.17-pre6 and waitq-2.4.17-mainline-1 (don't 
know who wrote it in the first place) on top of 2.4.17-preX with good 
results.

Are there any plans to get this into 2.4 mainline?

Thanks,
	Dieter

BTW waitq-2.4.17-mainline-1 do not apply to latest kernel versions.
