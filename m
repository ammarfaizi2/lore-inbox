Yes kernel fans, it's Gary's nag-the-kernel-list time once again.

November 1 is "Dia de Muertos", the Day of the Dead, the time for
visiting tombstones and honouring our ancestors.  A time when the dead
and gone can live through the words and deeds of the living.

The November 2000 KernelWiki Challenge is ...

"The _____ in the _____ subsystem implements the old _____."

1) Fill in the blanks, short and sweet, in your own words.

2) Go to http://kernelbook.sourceforge.net/wiki/?KernelWiki and find
   the KernelWiki page covering your area of expertise.

3) Click the "Edit this Page" link

4) Plunk your November KernelWiki response into the text box.

5) Click "Save" and get back to your happy hacking.

It's painless. All I want is 10 minutes of your time.  You know you
know the answers, and if you don't, you know the proper questions to
ask. I don't know how I can make it any easier.  10 minutes, 15 tops.

It takes longer to flame me for nagging, and contributing is more
positive.

No excuses. _Everyone_ has that kind of time to spare for Linux
documentation. There are hundreds of competent engineers active on
this list. One day's worth of our collective linux-kernel effort,
focused precisely on illuminating some part of the code, would
complete several chapters of text. A week's worth would fill a
thousand pages.

What do you win?  Do it right, and you might cause that "transmission
of light" which nets you assistance in your kernel hacking.  What
goes around, comes around.  'Karma' means 'action'.

WARNING: I am going to persist in nagging you to participate, but no
more than once a month ;) Chide me, ignore me, put me in your kill
file if you will but the KernelWiki _is_ working.

KernelWiki is a smash hit. KernelWiki is an overnight success.
KernelWiki has exceeded all expectations.  KernelWiki is the latest
craze, the subject of folk songs and Paris fashions.  Be the first in
your network segment to KernelWiki!

If you have more than 15 minutes to spare and you are interested in what
it is that I'm up to with this KernelWiki thing, you are invited to read

        http://kernelbook.sourceforge.net/wiki/?KernelWikiWhy
        http://kernelbook.sourceforge.net/wiki/?KernelWikiPolicies
        http://kernelbook.sourceforge.net/wiki/?HowToUseWiki

The diligent are invited to cruise KernelWiki for question marks
and click the mark to describe the undefined term.  KernelWiki 
depends on your kind contributions.

See you in December ;)
