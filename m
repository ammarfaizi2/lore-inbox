Uh, no. Tim *insisted* that he was illustrating the right problem even  
after it was pointed out that he didn't, *and* explained why.

In other words, the guy accusing other people of being arrogant assholes  
is a *dumb* arrogant asshole himself.

No. The right ones - both the original and the one Tim raised. *Tim*, of  
course, insisted they were one and the same.

Note that Tim was the one who brought up first the word "idiot", and then  
the "arrogant asshole". All the while accusing us of not being nice  
enough. I smell some double standards here.

Completely predictably, after not getting us to simply swallow his  
arguments without questioning the logic behind them, the next stage is  
"waah, you're all meanies, I'm taking my marbles and am going home".

That is not only no loss, it's good riddance.

> It seems to work for the folk who stay.  If we were all nice and polite,

... people like Tim will still cry how mean we are. Because that is  
exactly what happened.
