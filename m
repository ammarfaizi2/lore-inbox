Nope. Was just thinking. To be honest, I stopped doing kernel development
in the 2.0 days (but I keep up with LKML). This would be for 2.5 but
could probably be backported to 2.4 without too much trouble.

But tomorrow I may very well find myself out of a job (big surprise), and
if so, I'll setup a Linux box (since I've mostly been using OpenBSD
these days) and work on this (for i386 to begin with) if  there is enough
interest.

L8r,
Mark G.
