No, it's not just the single pointer chase. See my email to Linus.

I would, however, be willing to endorse the use of PG_compound, especially
under !MMU conditions for two reasons:

 (1) Safety. The current mechanism of managing intermediate pages is
     potentially fragile under uClinux.

 (2) put_page() and get_page() aren't actually called all that often compared
     to other things, especially under uClinux.
