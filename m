No.. the laptops are certified too. Not all the software on them I think,
but the hardware is definitely restricted and often modified.

The shuttle computers are designed for ONE task -- flying the spacecraft.
They are not designed to read email or play quake3. FWIW I do not think
you would WANT the shuttle computers doing anything else - these are
specially designed hard realtime triple redundant systems quite different
from laptops.

FWIW if you read the public records of space station and shuttle logs,
it's downright scary how often m$ stuff causes big problems up there.
