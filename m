Greetings;

Running 2.6.7-mm1 elevator=cfq on an athlon 1600-DX

Has anyone else noticed this?  These old fingers cannot do a dbl-click 
at the speeds it takes to make it work.  I don't think I noticed this 
in the half hour or so I ran 2.6.7, also with elevator=cfq.

But I'll reboot back to it and double check.  I have the dbl-click set 
for a full second in kde's prefs, it was at 600ms.  But that seems to 
be being ignored.
