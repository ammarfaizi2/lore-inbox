That's your opinion.  That's not our opinion.

We're not changing the wording in the license just because you have a
problem with it.  Unless some lawyer wants to explain to me why this
wording doesn't do what I want it to do, and unless I actually believe
they are operating in the best interests of BitMover, the language
stands as it is.  

Unless you are competing with us you have no reason to be worried.
