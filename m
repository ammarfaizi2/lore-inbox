I tried 2.5.47-ac5...
I got the configs confused so I had started from an old one and built up =
until=20
it crashed:

(%:/data/src/tp/2.5/linux-2.5.47-ac5)- diff .config ../CONFIG_works
159,167c159
< CONFIG_PNP=3Dy
< # CONFIG_PNP_NAMES is not set
< # CONFIG_PNP_DEBUG is not set
<=20
< #
< # Protocols
< #
< CONFIG_ISAPNP=3Dy
< CONFIG_PNPBIOS=3Dy

> # CONFIG_PNP is not set
213d204
< # CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ISAPNP is not set
362d352
< # CONFIG_NET_SB1000 is not set

=2Econfig crashes, it oopses as soon as pnp starts, then 2 seconds later =
the=20
previous oops comes up and it panics.

the only thing I managed to read was that the EIP was in kfree, and most =
of=20
the call traces had pnp_ in the name

I can't get the rest until I figure out how to get some kind of serial co=
nsole=20
working...I wonder if I can get it working over infrared to my pda :)

attached is the full .config:
--=20
