I did some digging trying to find that ratio before I posted last night
and couldn't.  You obviously think that the servers are a significant
part of their business.  I'd be surprised at that, but that's cool,
what are the numbers?  PC's, monitors, disks, laptops, anything with less
than 4 cpus is in the little bucket, so how much revenue does Dell generate
on the 4 CPU and larger servers?
