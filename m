The problem with this one is that things freeze so hard I haven't
been able to extract any information on what's going wrong.  Any
suggestions for how to track this down?

What: play a dvd using xine, X-windows, ALSA's oss emulation and
2.5.60 or 2.5.61.  After half an hour or less, system freezes solid.

What not: does not happen with 2.4 kernels.  Does not happen if
I switch to a console for the duration of the film.
