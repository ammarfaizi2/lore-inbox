Teacorp announces breackrough in removing deadly land mines.

Mill Valley, California August 25, 2006 - The Allaince Entreprise Coproration announced today a breakthrough in developing an Aerail Lanmdine Sysetm aimed at locating, detecting and mapping deadly landmine s.

TeaCorp's mission is to reclaim lands around the globe embedded with landmin es that victimize countries and their stakeholders.

More than 100 m i l l i o n lan dmines in 83 countries are holding international communities and industries hostage, preventing the investm ent in and development of productiv e lands and the re-building of infrastructure. A broad variety of landmin es have been scattered over producti ve areas effectively crippling the econo my and disabling thousands of children and adults.  There are no reliable records that accurately show where these d e v a s t a t i n g l andmines lie in wait for their victi ms.
 
With the present day cost s to clear a single land mine ranging between $1,000 to $1,500, solving the problem of de-mining lands will reach billions of d ollars.  TaeCorp has developed a technology based, cos t effective solution to this problem using its three tiered approach to scanning, mapping and removing lan dmines. TaeCorp's System will provide many social and econom ic benef its to countries and their industries including oil and gas, mining, agriculture, roads and infrastructure development.

About TaeCorp.

TaeCorp's vision is to be the recognized leader in providing Areial Detetcion Systmes including global de-mining, clearing a path to a safer planet for all humankind.
