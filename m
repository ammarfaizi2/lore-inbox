Hi,

    Quick and fast question here. I'm starting to create patches (diff) 
:-) so, I googled for a while and most say that one could use the diff 
-up or diff -Naur. They both look to me very similar and honestly -up 
works for me. Still, what command will make the cleanest patch and which 
one is mostly used?

Thanks for the time,

.Alejandro
