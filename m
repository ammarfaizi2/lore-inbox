	In one of the kernel build tutorials I found that I have to link the 
System.map file in /boot to the newly built System.map. But I find that it 
is automatically done at start up depending on which kernel version I chose 
to boot. Could anyone please tell who actually does it. I mean is it done by 
the kernel itself or by some start up scripts ?
