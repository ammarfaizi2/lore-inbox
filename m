There are more usable "products" out there and they usually do not have
the word "embedded" attached to them.

Read the software's documentation and/or ask their support and sales
departments.
Apart from that I seriously doubt that any anti-virus software fits on a
(embedded) system where you specifically look for "embedded" software
for - let alone the possible problems in the field with updates of virus
DBs e5tc.

Sure, because e.g. Win* binaries probably won't run on Unixens. Or what
do you really want to ask?
