Someone (possibly you) has requested that your email address be added
to or deleted from the mailing list "linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org".

If you do not want this action to be taken, simply ignore this message
and the request will be disregarded.

If your mailer will not allow you to send the entire command as a single

        linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
