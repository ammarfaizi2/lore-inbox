The protocol for adding an Acked-by line mystifies me a little.

If I submit a patch after having a good discussion of it with
Joe Blow, is it appropriate for me to add an Acked-by line for
Joe on my own, or should I get his consent (or know him well
enough to know he consents) or should I only so add if Joe
asks me to?

In other words, does the presence of such a line commit Joe
to any position on the patch, beyond perhaps not being too
annoyed if he gets queries on it.
