Mr. Kenneth Tyler
Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
18 Bank Place Melbourne
Australia.


Dear friend,

This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your
unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction requiring maximum
confidence. Though this approach appears desperate, I can assure you that
whatever questions you would need to ask or any other thing you will need
to know regarding this proposal will be adequately answered to give you
a clearer understanding of it, so as to arrive at a successful conclusion.

My name is Mr. Kenneth Tyler, Head of Securities,Commonwealth BanofAustralia,
Melbourne. On December 6, 2001, a foreign consultant/contractor with the
Cadbury Kenya Ltd, Mr. David Sidney Jocelyn-Duffield, made a numbered time fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30,000,000.00, (Thirty MillionUnited States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,I sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract 
employers,the Cadbury Kenya Ltd, that Mr. Jocelyn-Duffield died from an 
automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jocelyn-Duffield did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,includinghis Bank Deposit paperwork in our Bank. I have carefully moved out thesefunds(US$30million)from our bank as sundry funds to an offshore Deposit Company in the European Union.

>From past experiences, I know that no one will ever come forward to claim
the deceased funds. According to Australian Law, at the expiration of 5
(five) years,the funds will be Unclaimable and revert to the ownership of
the Australia Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. In order to avert this negative development,I in conjunction with a colleague (the Chief Operating Officer in the bank)now seek your permission to allow my attorney do a CHANOWNERSHIP/REASSIGNMENTOF CREDIT of stated funds from the "deceased" to your name, so that thefunds (US$30million) would be released to you as the new owner (on behalf of me and my colleague). We are writing you because, as public servants,we cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than$160,000:00. Consequently, I will present you as the owner of the  funds in the Deposit Company so you can be able to claim them. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately;

1. Full names
2. Contact address
3. Telephone and fax numbers

Once I receive these information, I will prepare the necessary documents
which will put you in place as the new owner of the funds. The money will
then be released to your custody by the Deposit Company, for us to share
in the ratio of 70% for us and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all
the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the solicitor and this
will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately via my email address. Upon your 
response,I shall then provide you with more details and my confidential phone numberfor further explanation that will help you understand the transaction.
No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive,please we imploy you to
observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction would
be most profitable for both of us because we shall require your assistance
to invest our share in your country(buying of properties like real estate
etc). This is why your urgent action and response is of priority to enable
us conclude this transaction in a timely and professional  manner.

I await your swift response please through my alternative/private email
box: tylerken2003@netscape.net, signifying your decision.

Regards,

Mr. Kenneth Tyler.
