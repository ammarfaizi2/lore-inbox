If you publish to the US, you can be sued under US law.

There's a german guy named as one of the defendants in
the DVD lawsuit in California. He has never even been
to California, but could end up being convicted for
doing something which is perfectly legal in Germany.

I don't think I want to take the risk of getting charged
with a crime in the US for something perfectly legal here.
I'd rather lock out the US and leave the legal risks to the
people who elected the folks who put these laws in place...

regards,

Rik
