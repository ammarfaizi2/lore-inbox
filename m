Apple's major claim-to-fame was that it represents an
"awesome, all-American computer", created by California
liberal entrepreneurs like Steve Wosniak and Steve Jobs.
Now, all engineering for the new platform will be done

It would be a major marketing slap for Jobs if the
new design was done in Indiana (USA), now it's going
to be done in India.
