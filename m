Hi,

I have compiled a 2.4 kernel (I was on 2.2) and it seems that everything
went
well. But when I tried uname -rs I found a 2.2 kernel ? Is it possible
that the
2.4 kernel run and that uname -rs result is wrong ? what really does uname
-rs ,
does it use proc system or maybe anything else ?

Thanks
