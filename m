it is most likely a problem with me, but I have tried everything and I keep
getting the error that device not found or busy. I get this rather I use the
kernel modules for this card, or I try alsa's driver pack.
Is there some configuration step that you did when using the kernel module?
I had this working a long time ago under the 2.2.x kernel, so I know that
the sound card works, it also works on my W2k hard drive.

I am running kernel 2.4.6 on a toshiba satellite 225CDS and toshiba 
tecra 8000 (both use OPL3sa2 driver), and sound is working well.  What 
exactly do you have problems with?  Is this a redhat problem (a problem 
with sndconfig)?
