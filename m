Hi Phillip,

is there a way to use squashfs regularly as an ordinary user? I would love to 
use it as a replacement for tar archives, but as long as one needs to be root 
in order to mount the squashed fs it is quite impractical. Maybe a FUSE 
gateway would be a feasible solution?

BTW, shoot me in the face if this is a faq and has already been answered 
somewhere :)

  Francesco
