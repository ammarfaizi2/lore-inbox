Perhaps you are looking for BSD? This is Linux, and the GPL, and we use 
something called 'copyleft' that is designed to ensure everyone has freedom 
and no one can take it away.

Heh... I suspect you won't be spending much time on or around LKML if that's 
your attitude. There are a fair number of kernel developers that believe 
strongly enough in all this stuff that they would make legal threats / sue 
(rightfully so) over someone writing proprietary drivers.

Indeed, but at least he's provided the world with something of value.

What exactly were you saying "not even close" to? That free software is 
started and written by most as a hobby? That GPL is business friendly? 
Because if you deny it, you're simply WRONG.

I have an important question for you. If you don't like the license / 
philosophy / players behind this free software / open source thing, what the 
fuck are you doing in LKML? It's really obnoxious to come waltzing into a 
community and start telling people "Someone should
probably put an end to these miserable efforts."

In truth, I have some co-workers that feel like you do about copyleft and the 
GPL - moaning, groaning and bitching about it. The irony is that they would 
be in NO WAY affected by the GPL (it's a *license to distribute*, not a 
*contract for use*) unless they decided to make copies. More specifically, 
the reason they're always bitching is because they _very specifically_ want 
to TAKE and not GIVE BACK.

If you recall, Eric Raymond once said we don't need the GPL anymore. If I 
recall correctly, that was the last time Eric Raymond made the headlines. He 
rode out on a wave of vast disagreement from the community, and last I 
checked, no one has gone from the GPL back to public domain.
