Is this available as a patch, or preferably as a compilation option to
the standard kernel?

The ASIC tools that we use wants all the memory they can grab, and the
extra few hundred megs can sometimes be _very_ critical.  On Solaris,
Synopsys' Design Compiler can allocate 3.8Gig and we've hit that limit
hard when working with toplevel netlists and SDF databases.

Thanks in advance,


Kai
