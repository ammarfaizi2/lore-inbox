There seems to be a contingent of people on the LKML who think that it
is appropriate to flame people off-list, in order to bask in their own
superiority, or prove that they are smarter by pointing out that someone
is an idiot, etc. I would figure that most intelligent people would
simply ignore posts they don't like, rather than investing time and
bandwidth compounding the perceived offense. But I'm apparently too
optimistic on that point; any group of people the size of the LKML will
always contain some juviniles. A great many of us have suffered their
attention.
