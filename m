I've no doubt that his posts seemed off-topic for linux-kernel, I
would argue that they are certainly on-topic for linux-assembly. (I
also imagine the latter sees much less traffic than the former, thus
hp's comment.) I rather doubt that the complaints were coming from
both lists, given that his stuff is far more interesting that the
usual linux-assembly posts ("how do I write a number to screen without
using BIOS?!") Assuming this is true, perhaps it would make more sense
to allow him to continue posting to linux-assembly?
