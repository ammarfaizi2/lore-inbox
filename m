i have a korean a4 tech keyboard with several extra "hotkeys," and i'd 
like to know how to use them all.  i got the values of them using 
"showkey -s", and they are all e0 keys, but with "showkey -a" and 
"showkey -k" i get nothing.  there are also two more keys for the korean 
part (one's meant to enter chinese characters, and the other to switch 
between korean and ascii) that have values 0xf1 0xf2 when pressed, and 
nothing when released.  thank you, and please respond to my email address, 
as i'm not subscribed.

it's not "politically correct" anymore.  it's "socially affirming."
