Not to mention the fact that GNU/Linux is the worst sounding and ugliest
looking name you could pick imho. I'd rather do the Mozilla way
"linux-gnu". It sounds better and the kernel is the most important
piece is it not? I agree the GNU project deserves some kind of credit
but I don't think it should be in the name exactly..no one's forced to
use GNU things I believe if you really _wanted_ to you could replace all
the GNU stuff with proprietary stuff and such...I would never do it but
heh I don't think you need GNU to use Linux.
