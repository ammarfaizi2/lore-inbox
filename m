I believe Linus explicitly said he wasn't going to tell anyone, which
means we're back to the days of "through it on the list over and over
until someone admits to seeing it." Or send it to everyone who might be
willing to push it to Linus when he gets back.

By not accepting stuff at this point I would guess that the defacto freeze
is here. Hope I'm wrong, there is some good stuff which would be ready by
Oct 31.
