As I said, *both* drives have extensive file system problems.  No, the 
machine was not powered down for a long time, and no, neither of these
drives are old, and no, they are not from the same factory batch (they
aren't even the same vendor, one is a Maxtor and the other is a Seagate),
and yes, I of course tried different cable/controller/machine combos.

Any other questions?
