Hi,

Trying to compile $subj with following config (these options seem to
cause the problem, full config attached):

CONFIG_SCSI_MEGARAID=y
CONFIG_SCSI_MEGARAID2=y

gives me this result:

gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/disk2/usr/src/Kernel/linux-2.4.24/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i586

Is this a known issue and megaraids can't live together, or am I
supposed to be able to compile both drivers in and this is a bug?
