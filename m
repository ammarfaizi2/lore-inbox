It has been pointed out that on the main web page
(http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/kernel/o1.php) it is very
difficult to see that the section entitled "Some problems with the
O(1) scheduler" contains links to the full problem descriptions (the
links aren't underlined and the color looks almost black).

So, in case you missed that, please do click on those links to get the
full description.

I'll see what we can do to improve the layout of the page.

Thanks,

	--david
