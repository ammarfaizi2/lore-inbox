	No. He can't.

	Correct. However, all the GPL-based ones grant rights *automatically* upon
distribution. "Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on
the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms
and conditions"

	Correct. However, the recipient gets the benefit of all GPL-style licenses.
That's what clause 6 says, particularly the "automatically" part and the
"from the original licensor" part.

	Correct. The grant of GPL license is automatic on distribution, and it is
from the original author to the recipient.
