come on, it's hard for me as it's hard for you. not everybody
expect a computer to be like people here thinks how a computer
should be.

think about personal devices. something like the nokia communicator.
a system security passwd is acceptable, but that's it. no those-
device-user would like to know about user account, file ownership,
etc. they just want to use it.

that also explain why win95 user doesn't want to use NT. not
because they can't afford it (belive me, here NT costs only
us$2), but additional headache isn't acceptable.

with multi-user concept, conceptually there should be an
administrator to create account, grant permission, etc.
no my sister doesn't want that. i bet there are billions of
people not willing to learn how to use a computer, they just
want to use it.

and yes, mobile devices access network.

so what the hell is transmeta doing with mobile linux (midori).
is it going to teach multi-user thing to tablet owners?
surely mortals expect midori to behave like their pc. lets say
on redhat, they have to login as root to access their files,
they don't even know what a root is!

lets break unix mind for a while, and give everyone a chance
to use linux.
