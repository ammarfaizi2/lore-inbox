Hello everybody!

I get an ooops and immediate kernel panic when I break (CTRL-C) cdrecord. I 
can reproduce it anytime. I use 2.4.5-ac series. Obviously, Linus' 2.4.5 is 
fine.

I know, I know. I was supposed to make a serios oops report, BUT I wasn't 
able to get the serial console running. (I've read some people couldn't get 
it to run either.)

Can anyone help me with any of the problems?

Rudo Thomas.
