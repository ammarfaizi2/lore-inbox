I have an Surecom EP-320X-S Ethernet adapter which apparently uses a
Myson MTD-8xx chip. It works well with the "fealnx" driver (labeled
"Myson MTD-8xx PCI Ethernet support" in kernel config) except for one thing:
After a while in use it stops working and prints

Jun 21 12:18:18 naut kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
Jun 21 12:18:18 naut kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status 00000000, resetting...
Jun 21 12:18:18 naut kernel:   Rx ring c1272140:  80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000
Jun 21 12:18:18 naut kernel:   Tx ring c12722c0:  80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 80000000 0000

a few times in the kernel log. Then I have to bring the interface down and up
again (ifdown/ifup) to get it working. It seems that the higher network
load the sooner it will stop working, but it always does eventually. It's
impossible to transfer a large file (over, say 5 MB) via FTP for example, but
with scp it often works (the encryption makes the transfer slower).

CC me. thanks,
