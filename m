No, that's probably a good thing. I don't care how good any programming
team might be, an implementation written from scratch probably should burn
in for a while before going in anywhere it might be used for production.

And with all respect to the group, a 4th rewite from scratch in only a few
years suggests that the ratio of coding to designing is pretty high.
