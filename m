Erik,

Explain how a symbol in 2.4 which was EXPORT_SYMBOL is now
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL in 2.6 ?

When you can explain why the API for functionallity in 2.4 is ripped off
like an old lady's purse by a two-bit punk and made nojn-functional in 2.6
you may have a point.

But, you know what, I don't give a damn (DGD).

It is wrong and the original intent when it was discussed was for "NEW
SYMBOLS ONLY".  But if distros can add in Symbols for code that does not
exist in the tree, why can't people change them?

But you have a nice day, and do you need a mail address for that letter
you want to send me?  Please make it on heavy stock, you need some fiber
in your diet.

Cheers,

Andre Hedrick
