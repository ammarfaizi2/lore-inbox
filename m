Hi Geert.

Actually "c" in Marcin is correct in that place.

If I'm not mistaken Marcin is from Poland (or his father, or ..)
and in the polish language if you want to write the "ch" sound
(ch as in check) you write a c with an apostrofe above it if the
following letter is not a, e, i, o, u. If it IS one of those you
write "ci" instead instead of "c with an apostrofe".

Ciemno (dark).
,
Cma (a type of bug).

So, no, his name was not spelled wrong :)

Same goes for a few other characters as well.

Pronounce his name and it becomes clear why. Mar (ch) in.
Ci is a LONG sound.
,
C is a short sound. So Marcin would be pronounced Mar (ch) n.

Compare saying Check or Chck. Same thing.

// Stefan
