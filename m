How many billions of years exactly?  :)

Of course it sometimes _has_ been a problem.  Repeating your claim
doesn't make it true.  And the user model of USB was certainly so
those problems could be _prevented_ rather than continued forever
into new generations of hardware.

The fact that MS-DOS did something does not make it a good idea.

This is LKML.  Pointing out when patches are overdue
can't realistically be taken as a flame; it's a
standard way of moving beyond discussion to action.
(Or helping someone self-educate about issues they
won't see until they, too, look more deeply ...)

However, responding to a "request for patch" in that
way certainly does come across as a flame.
