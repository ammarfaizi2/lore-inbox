If you're looking for drivers, please go to isdn4linux.de (or search for newsgroups that have "isdn4linux" in their title). As far as I know the current hisax drivers (which are included in the kernel as well) support d-channel. But the d channel is only meant for starting a connection, not to support whole traffic. And it is rather slow. So it would make no fun compared to 64kbs...
I can provide you an email address of one linux-guy from AVM. This (german) company is responsible for many active isdn cards and I think their drivers are supporting d-channel too.
