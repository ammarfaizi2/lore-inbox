Richard has seems not to have a precise edge in meaning, which makes his comments
rather inappropriate for a technical list, but otherwise he is not far
off the mark..  Implementing a system with freedom always means
finding a compromise between being able to do anything yourself, and
not allowing other people to do nasty things to you.

Hogwash.  The BSD license has not provisions to keep the source code
freely available.  Consider what the world would be like if anyone was
allowed to do anything to you they wanted, if murder was legal.

The GPL forces people to respect others freedom to use a work so
covered.  That is still a power, but used in a good way.  The power
to silence criticism is definitely not a power that enhances anyones
freedom.

I want the right to murder you can I have that?

Freedom is not about having the ability to do anything, without
punishment.  Only about having that ability so long as it does not
restrict the freedom of others.  Anti-hoarding seems to fit that
definition for me.

I do agree that the GPL is an imperfect enforcer of freedom.  It makes
it hard to mix and match GPL'd code with code that comes from another
source.

All that needs to be admitted is that freedom has teeth.
