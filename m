IBM and MontaVista have initiated a joint project to develop a
dynamic power management control and policy mechanism for Linux
for processors supporting dynamic voltage and frequency scaling.
A paper describing the proposal can be obtained from

http://www.research.ibm.com/arl/projects/dpm.html

A working prototype of the proposed framework for
the IBM PowerPC 405LP processor exists and will be made
public in the near future.
