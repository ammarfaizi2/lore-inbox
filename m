for umask/getppid(), its a basic loop with 100.000.000 iterations
for read/write(), loop with 10.000.000 iterations

elapsed time (/usr/bin/time ./prog)
10 runs, and the minimum time is taken.

Its a 1.6GHz Pentium-M CPU (Dell D610)

Hum... Do you mean a cache miss every time we do a syscall ? What could 
invalidate this cache exactly ?
