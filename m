Pax.  I think that Rik made a good point RE bluetooth support, and 
obviously no one with cache  in the kernel community cares enough about 
the non-free implications of using BK (an admittedly good tool) to keep 
the kernel source free of such endorsements.  In conceding I appreciate 
but disagree with your position.  Oh, and of course Al showed his ass on 
your behalf thus proving that intelligence and politeness are not related.

Respectfully,
Jonathan
