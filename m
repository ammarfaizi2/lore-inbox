I'm not certain I understand what you mean here. Nasty messages using 
the word "taint" is purely subjective.
(as is your opinion or anyone else's about the use of the word, 
including my opinion). Based upon the way the GPL is worded, "taint"
actually goes the other way in legal circles when corporate attorneys 
talk about using GPL code with non-GPL code.

i.e. "... If we use that linux code it will TAINT our development 
process and CONTAMINATE and POULLTE our proprietary
development efforts with GPL code and we do not know the IP sources of 
such code...".

You should change it to "non-GPL" rather than "tainted" since the use of 
this word is actionable and inaccruate of reality.
Free GPL code is what it is. The GPL is the only thing that "taints" IP. 
The use of the word is reversed. Also Linus, we do
open source and promote certain projects outside of the Linux Kernel -- 
and we fully support the GPL.

You can still do whatever you want, but people who support the resulting 
mess know that they shouldn't.


BULLSHIT. I diagree and you are talking out of both sides of your mouth.
