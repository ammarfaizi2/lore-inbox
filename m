If you're still reading what Daniel sends then I can't help much, I was
completely serious before.  I've wasted too many hours in the past
rebutting and correcting everything he says and gave up long ago, sorry.
No, he doesn't work on the same project.  He has nothing to do with this
software and doesn't understand the first thing about it.

If you have questions, please ask.  If you don't want conflicting replies
then I simply suggest ignoring either me or Daniel Phillips; it's
completely up to you.

Dave
