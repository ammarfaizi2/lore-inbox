People are using the archive and discovering my earlier question about
getting my ATA-100 drive to work on  the Asus A7A266, and are now
writing to see whether I ever got a solution.

I did, and since I have had a number of enquiries I decided to excerpt
the correspondence as a pseudo-howto.  I am posting this message in
hopes that others may find the information useful.

The information is at
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/bdbryant/howtos/hardware/asus-a7a266/DMA_for_ATA-100/

Good luck with it, and holler if you have better suggestions.
