Hi all!

I'm in the process (well, no realy, but soon) of writing a driver
for a telephony board (manufacturer has decided not to support the
Linux plateform, sad...).

I've got the LDD2, the LKMPG, the Linux code. I know about
KernelNewbies and have spent quite a few weeks reading through LKML.
Everything is getting well in place both in my head and in my
employer's.

Anyhow, some pointers to this kind of work, to other source of
information, anything you might be worth reading/downloading/compiling
will be welcome.

But then, we'll have to 'deal' with the board manufacturer to obtain
the specifications. What we'd like to do is sign no NDA, as to provide
the community with yet another driver (I need assistance to write such
a piece of code and I feel it GOOD to release that driver _free_).

So here's the question:
Where could I find some kind of a manifesto to show the manufacturer
to have him understand the pros (and cons) of GPL Software, so they
release the HW specs.

When the manufacturer doesn't agree with GPL, what kind of NDA would
be most valuable to sign, as to provide the most possible info to
the comunity? I know some have signed NDAs and release only binaries.
Would that be a satisfactory agreement?

Thanx all!
Yann, hoppefully futur linux device driver writer! ;-)
