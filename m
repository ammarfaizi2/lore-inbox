     Hi,

  I've updated the Linux-Progress patch for the 2.4.13 kernel. It works
pretty well. Though, I need more information about the order in which
each of the kernel parts are loaded (a look-in-this-file answer would be
perfect to me). Also, I don't know where to put such a patch to every
one can use it (it is too big to be sent to this list).
  The lpp project on sourceforge seems dead :-(.
