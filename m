Well, actually it would be good to have that incremental patch
as a reply to the mail (like Greg does).
The reason I asked for the incremental patch is that I have to search
the diff and decide if I have to apply that to my server kernel or not.
If it was as reply, this would be much easier.

But anyway. Thanks for maintaining 2.6.16.x. I very much like
to have a stable series kernel for my server.
