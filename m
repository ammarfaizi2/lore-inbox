Maybe a graphics card is too coslty to develop and implement. I would really
like to see such a project for an open soundcard. I mean how expensive can
it be to slap a dsp plus some DA/AD's on a pci board? A simple 4in/4out card
doing up to 48/16 or even 96/24 could probably be developed much cheaper
than a graphics card. And it could serve as a test on how people would react
to such an "open" hardware product.
