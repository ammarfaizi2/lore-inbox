    So, encouraging non-uniform terminology, breaking applicates *and*
    confusing the hell out of everyone is better?  Face it, the only
    people trying to confuse things are the disk vendors.  DRAM is
    sold by the MB, everyone talks about MB == 1024*1024...  I'm
    having a hard time giving a sympathetic ear to anyone try to
    change the well established, and consistent (barring the storage
    venduhs), standard.

And disks by the GB where GB == 1000^3 so I don't see any problem in
moving from KB to KiB and friends ESPECIALLY AS THEY ARE STANDARDIZED
BEYOND THE KERNEL and nothing will change this.
