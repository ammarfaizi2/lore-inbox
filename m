I got an ASUS A8V-E with a 3500+ CPU, 2 GB of ram. I have had not problem with it.

I run Bluesmoke on it (bluesmoke.sourceforge.net), which is renamed EDAC in a submission for
inclusion in the kernel (hopefully 2.6.16). Bluesmoke, scans the the K8's Memory controller
looking for Correctable Errors that occur. The idea is that detection correctable errors and
replacing memory can reduce sudden uncorrectable errors.

But your problem seems generated by the motherboard, no memory. SOMETHING is not quite right.
