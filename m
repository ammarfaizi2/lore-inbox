A "I don't like don't like <FOO> and won't apply it" is not a communications problem in general. When the person trying to submit <FOO> keeps submitting it without listening to suggestions or to reasons why it's not applied.... THEN there is a one sided communcation problem.

Not saying that's the case here, but it starts to appear to be so.
