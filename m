Hello;
Does linux kernel have symlink support for sambfs ? I tried doing a
search on the internet and i obtained a site that gives patches till
version 2.4.0.The address is :
http://131.130.199.155/~aoe/mystuff/smb.symlinks/
Do the latest versions of the kernel have support for symlinks in smbfs ?
I would like to know whether anyone has experiemented with it before i
jump into putting my own effort into porting the code that is already present
to the current kernel.
Finally is symlinks in sambafs a security hazard and hence it is not
implemented ?
Thanks
K.Shyam
