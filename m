Here you have hit on the real problem.

I got hit with a virus this way once long ago - I did something about
it.  No more problems.  IN fact, anyone who's using McAfee to scan their
mail under 9x/NT is fine.  Even if they try to open the attachment.

So banning Outlook/Hotmail is not the answer.  Education is.

My proposal to block mail composed with Outlook was half serious but I
believe that the reason behind this half serious side is that it
educates
users.
