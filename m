Machines have changed a lot since then, unless you get a vintage machine
(with original disk, etc) I very much doubt this will work.

Besides, I don't think learning about a *very* old, severely broken kernel
will help in any way. Yes, the current kernel is huge, but most of that is
drivers for all sort of exotic hardware.
