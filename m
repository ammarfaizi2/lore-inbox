Linux isn't the only free operating system in existance, and although
BK seems to suit the requirements of a lot of Linux developers, that
doesn't mean that it meets the requirements of other free OS
development teams.

I strongly suspect that we'll see a free SCM developed after a few
more years of HURD development, for example.

Doesn't mean we'll switch to it, though, we haven't switched to my bug
database, have we?  :-).

John.
