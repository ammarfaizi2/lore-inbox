chromatic has written a very nice article on the Linux Quality database
at Newsforge:

Linux Quality Database: One man's quest for kernel quality
http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/05/17/204213&mode=thread

The site itself is at http://linuxquality.sunsite.dk/

You will see it is still in the planning stages.  Life has been quite
hectic these last months, but I am making slow progress and I'm starting
to get more time now.  I have written a couple of articles you may find
useful, one on testing the kernel and the other on testing web
applications.  The kernel testing article is at:

Using Test Suites to Validate the Linux Kernel
