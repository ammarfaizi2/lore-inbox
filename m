Well, those don't give me any clues.

I had the system running that kernel for a bit over an hour and got
five of the "bad" messages, approximately evenly spaced in a
two-minute interval about 20 minutes after boot.

I did notice one improvement compared to vanilla 2.6.8.1.  The sound
didn't skip when I switched from X to a text console.  However, my
keyboard no longer worked in X, but that seems to be due to some
recent changes to the input subsystem.

Did you build it with our without my patch, BTW?
