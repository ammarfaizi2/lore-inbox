Hi all
It is my first post here.
I didn't find any other mailing list talking about module-init-tools 
(nor a wiki page), so I am posting here.
I got module-init-tools-0.9.14, I compiled and installed (as written in 
the README) but I got a segmentation fault when I tested modprobe.
Although, I got the testsuite and ran the test and all went well !!!!
Is there anybody who got this pb before.
For info, I didn't optimized the compiler options, nor I have any 
hardware pb, because all is ok !!
bye
