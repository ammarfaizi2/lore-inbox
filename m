If you said that 2 mails ago (instead of telling me to go away), I
would not be wasting your time. [Oh and you should also put that ftp
pointer in the docs, so it is easy to find. GPL requires that...]

> Pavel, the problem here is your fundamental distrust.  

By giving me binary-only installer you ask me to trust you. You ask me
to trust you without good reason [it only generates .tar.gz and
shellscript, why should it be binary? Was not shar designed to handle
that?], and that's pretty suspect.
