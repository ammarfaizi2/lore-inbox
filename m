I don't believe that for a second.

The law is not a mindless computer that just follows orders. It's 
interpreted by human beings.

And the DMCA has been interpreted already in real lawsuits to mean that 
"circumvention" is not "anything you say is circumvention". See the 
decision on garage door openers, for example.

Besides, the people who inserted the DRM code explicitly gave you 
permission to modify it, so the whole point is moot. There's no 
"circumvention".

The fact is, you can always come up with made-up problems, and try to 
solve them. That's what "Throwing out the baby with the bath-water" 
_means_ for christ sake! Using a solution that has _known_ problems 
(GPLv3) for a problem that you made up and don't even know it's real.

In engineering, it's called over-desiging, and it's stupid. In law, it's 
called "billable hours", and it's encouraged.
