You have obviously absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Period.

So how do you propose to secure devices like MRT's or X-Ray scanners or
life-support in a hospital? Nowadays this equipment  is hooked to the
internal network of the hospital and protected by really paranoid
firewalls. Do you really want unneeded software on those devices?

Or what about the computer systems in nuclear powerplants? In air defense
systems?  Power grids? Water supply?

Oh come on! Just reread some of the newspapers back from Dec 31 1999!
