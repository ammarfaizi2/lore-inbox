Hi,

I am facing a very strange problem with squid. Users in my LAN are not able 
to connect to some of the HTTPS sites. On that particular sites it keeps on 
asking for username and password.... but if I configure the client to direct 
access ..then I gives the webpage and asks for user name and password in 
html page...

Any input to resolve this problem is welcomed.... Kindly help

Thanks and Regards,

Pankaj Agarwal
