Well, I couldn't possibly comment on that, but my original point stands;
that pursuit of GPL violation must be pursued by the copyright _holder_,
unless they assign that copyright to subsequent third-party beneficiaries.
which technically I don't think they do, they merely grant a right to make
copies in perpetuity, subject to the conditions of the GPL (or something
like that)

right ?
