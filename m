Finally, _Linux_Device_Drivers, second edition, by Alessandro Rubini and
myself, is available online.  Find it at:

  http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdrive2/chapter/book/index.html

It's there in HTML, PDF, and XML (DocBook) forms.  The license is the GNU
FDL, which allows redistribution and all that cool stuff.

Enjoy,
