So it is very hard to find out what the patch really contains (except 
for listing the files of course). Some idea to find out what change sets 
are in?

How do you feel about adding things like Alsa and swsuspend-for-2.4? I 
would say that it are nice-to-haves for a lot of people from hardware 
support and functionality point of view. Not to say that both are 
examples of what both individual users as distribution makers might want 
to add to their kernels.
