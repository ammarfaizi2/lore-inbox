Calm down please, and get on with your job. The way you and Wietse
are trying to advocate Linux to change, is obviously just not working
out. Your politics only inflame, there is no progress in this thread.
Please stop it, and either ignore Linux in your software, or learn
how to use netlink for your task. There have been offers of help,
and you could probably have working code by now, if you took those
offers, instead of writing nice political speeches.

Please, EVERYBODY calm down. There is only pain. Deal with it.

regards
  Patrick
