Amen, Jeff, now where did I put my sunglasses, I want to watch this as 
carefully as I watched the SCO debacle, at least till the outcome is 
carved in legal decisions rendered.  In a pinch I can go get my welding 
helmet, its can auto-darken to ND13.  But at that brightness, I want all 
bare skin covered too, else instant sunburns...
