Since Andrew's not exactly enthusiastic about maintaining must/should fix
lists, I've put them up in wiki form on the kernelnewbies wiki.

http://kernelnewbies.org/wiki/moin.cgi (on the front page, towards the bottom)

Maybe if everybody can edit them, they'll stay more-or-less uptodate.

I've edited them a bit to get rid of some of the bits I know are done, but
I'm sure there's plenty of things in there that are done.  In particular,
I incorporated Nick Piggin's patch that he sent earlier today.
