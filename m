This hard cash is already being spent, here and now, and it is being
spent on programmer salaries and the equipment for them to work on.

Believe it or not, the businesses shelling out paychecks in our
directions are not charities and as such the work we do for them must
be directed to meet their needs. The reality is that the technical
knowledge programmers have of kernel (and hardware, and app) mechanics
is relayed in some form, no matter how dumbed down, up the food chain,
and if concerns are expressed and action taken by those working in the
field they will either be heeded by the effective organizations or
dismissed by those doomed to failure.

This is work, even if we ourselves would play in the same manner. If
effort, contributions, and visible benefits are not provided,
demonstrated, and delivered in a timely fashion, you -will- lose out,
and your own needs and those of your organization will not be addressed.

Bill
