Absolutely.

Putting out the source for a game would be financial suicide. Unlike 
(most) corporations, Kids don't understand or care about licenses. The 
trouble with digital data as we all know is that it is infinitely 
perfectly reproducible. In my industry (games), that includes binaries :(

Of course I and probably many others are moving to a new model for our 
games. I'm probably being more radical than most; Open Source client 
software. Useless of course without a connection to my server side code :)

It's the first game I've produced that is pirate proof.

Somewhat like Larry's business model I think?
