I found it once a week ago, but I can't find the syntax to use in fstab
to mount drives in the "mount --bind olddir newdir" syntax. 

I have read fstab man page + search goodle (pulling up too much, I must
be missing the right keyword)and can't find the answer. A cc: would be
much appreciated, too.

Thanks
Matt
