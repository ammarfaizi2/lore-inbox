Hi folks

Here is a little update to what I posted over one year ago. Some ppl are still 
asking me about this driver. It's now avaliable from:
http://gj.pointblue.com.pl/projects/mb800_watchdog.tar.bz2

I had no chance to rewrite it properly, sorry. If someone wants me to, I will 
need this motherboard. If someone else want's to make it properly, using 
watchdog api, and has this bord with him - it will be nice. 

Thanks.
