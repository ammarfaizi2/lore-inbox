To me, the true value of Linux is that there is no company that can take 
over Linux and End of Life it as a product.
For that reason, Linux is the most risk free discision anyone can make.
1) The product will never "End of Life".
2) You don't have to "Request for feature" and wait for the supplier to 
implement it in their own leasurely time. You can add it yourself or get 
someone to add if for you in timescales you set.
3) Bugs are fixed faster, as there is a larger amount of developers than 
any other product.
