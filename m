Ohh _G_  Is that Why!? I thought it was cause there were some problems 
with 2 guys and a non-free Software? James gave me what I needed to 
know. ;-) Thanks.

And I really hope that Linus can find a way to do things better for him 
and everyone else. Hopefully someone can create an SCM as nice and good 
as I read BK was...

Sorry for invoking this old topic.
