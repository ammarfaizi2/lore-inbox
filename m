Processes must be migrated to other nodes when a node is being
removed.  Conversely, processes may be migrated from other nodes when
a node is added.  I'm not familiar with NUMA things, and I think our
team doesn't have a particular solution.  If you have some idea,
that's great.

BTW, it seems page migration can use my remap_onepage function.  Our
code can move most kinds of pages including hugetlbfs pages and page
caches.
