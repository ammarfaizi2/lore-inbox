Hi,

I'm trying to format the UDF format brand new DVD under Linux system. But
I'm new
to UDF, and I've never done kernel recomile before, Can any body here give
me
some brief steps that I can follow to finish the task?

Thanks a lot in advance!

Jie

BTW, I found a website which has some basic steps:
http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~sight95/linux/dvd-ram/dvd-ram-english.html#dvd-ram

But seems it's not for the UDF format DVD, but do you think those steps are
similar to the UDF DVD?
Can i just change some steps into UDF form command and remain other steps
the same and get the
task done? Thanks a bunch!
