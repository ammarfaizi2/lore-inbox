I had a problem with eepro100.
It was fixed same night cause I had the source.
Don't even try to compare with MickyS**t.

When companys with less than a dozen people think it's worth while paying
someone like me to develop code exclusivly for Linux we've got to have a
chance. Source to binary ratio is probably 70/30 mainly because of code
tied up in previous companys but they are trying.

The project they're funding now is more like 90% GPL. Of course I could be
producing crap code. 20 years kernel hacking and a cybernetics degree can't
mean as much as being an MSCE.


ps. This is definately a message from home and a bottom of a glass of whisky.
