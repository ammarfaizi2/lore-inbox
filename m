Hello,

I have got 2 Linux machine with kernel 2.4.0 i kernel 2.2.18.
I am in Belgrade , Yugoslavia and I can't access to any hosts :

for example, www.linux.co.yu (Island), www.skyrr.is, www.hotmail.com etc

Access is ok with kernel 2.2 even in a case when machine with 2.4 kernel is
masquerading host.
It doesn't work with any port.
Ping works.

I think that these hosts are behind CISCO PIX firewall.

I am not sure if it is related with seting kernel.

Regards
Haris Peco
