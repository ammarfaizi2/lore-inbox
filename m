Even if we have a bigger DMA zone, it's no guarantee that the obtained
page is precisely in the given mask.  We can unlikely define zones
fine enough for all different 24, 28, 29, 30 and 31bit DMA masks.


My patch for i386 works well in most cases, because such a device is
usually equipped on older machines with less memory than DMA mask.

Without the patch, the allocation is always <16MB, may fail even small
number of pages.
