Where is Dell's Head Quarters?
Please goto your local justice and get a UK ruling for a US Corporation.
What gives you the right to pursue in court GPL for materials you do not
have copyright ownership?  I use this loose in this case because you now
have copyright context in the material in question.

Third party defense will be laughed out of court.

I know first hand that I can not take "RAIDZONE" to court yet to sue for
GPL violation to get the code back into the community and monetary
damages, until I fully file a registered copyright and not the halfassed
crap of just sticking you name and email address in a file.

I am in the process of getting the formal registered copyright.

I will take GPL to court and will not settle out of court.
GPL will live or die in this case, I do not give a damn which way it
falls.

GPL wins great.
GPL loses, maybe better so it can be replaced with OSL and then it gets
serious because we will have teeth to defend the ideas of open source.
