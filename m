WAKE UP!

We have files in the kernel we can't distribute.  We have a copyright
holder in that particular area who told you to stop it.  I told you
it's not okay and I'm a major kernel copyright holder to.  Do Adam & me
need to ask the vendors and mirrors to take the kernel tarball down
first before you react?

In fact if I see no action in, let's say a week, I'll probably do
exactly that.
