Yes, but that's precisely the point. Free software doesn't replace
the specialists, but it strenghtens their position to help you, and
it enables more people to become such specialists that help
themselves or others.

When deciding which product to use, its long-term viability plays a
role in both worlds. Open Source does not imply a guarantee that a
product will be useful forever, but if your company-wide integrated
IT solution comes from dead-now.com, you're out of luck too, no
matter how much you paid them, or what glowing promises they made
in the contract.
