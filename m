These things are just the internet's way of natural population control. Those
people who execute things blindly of their own accord deserve whatever happens
to them.

While these things are a nuisance, they're hardly that big of a deal. These
kind of things have existed forever, and people have somehow managed to get
by.

If people are that concerned that they might possibly be exploited by it,
they have a number of solutions:

	1) Get a real OS
	2) Get a real Email client
	3) Apply common sense where possible

These 3 easy steps are the quickest way to abolish these kind of things once
and for all.
