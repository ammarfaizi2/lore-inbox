Yes, good point, that needs to work too.  What I'm thinking here is that we 
need to turn off the link-on bit in the self ID packets we send out and then 
generate a bus reset before we suspend.  It shouldn't be necessary to change 
upper level drivers, the SBP-2 driver should just remaind logged in to the 
storage device.  When resuming, we re-enable the link-on bit and do a bus 
reset again, and should be back in operation.
