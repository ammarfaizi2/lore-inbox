No, you can sell it as well, but you have to give the buyer the same rights
you got (under the GPL), this still has value as you can sell it for any
price you want and you can add other value to yours sales (sure, after the
first couple sales people will be able to find it for free on the net or
included in the kernel, but if they want your support for it, they need pay
you).
