Just a short (general) note on that:
I find it amazing how some companies manage to ignore valuable input, because
even good companies can always get better through listening to customers. Alas
good companies can get real bad if they don't. So take a customers' choice:
stop buying their products if they don't listen to you in case of problems.
This is market, you always have another choice.

Are we _really_ sure this is a BIOS issue? What's the ACPI-maintainers opinion?
I can't really comment technically, I have no deep knowledge about ACPI ...

Regards,
Stephan
