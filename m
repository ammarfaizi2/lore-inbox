I've been trying to get you to quantify this further.  So far, all we've
seen are half-sides of the story.  Please give the full story:

1. Quantify how much discussion about GNU patches there is on LKML in
   total.
2. Quantify how much discussion about BK merges there is on LKML.

And now this is the important bit that hasn't been done:

  Including how many of each class:
  a) have been included into Linus' tree.
  b) have not been included into Linus' tree.

Then you can come up with sensible figures that actually mean something,
rather than some vague fear about a phenomenon that may in fact be a
fantasy.

Facts.  Facts.  Facts.
