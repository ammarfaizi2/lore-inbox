I did place the order for the board, and a cheap Chaintech Gforce 5200
video card in case the onboard doesn't work out for this app.  The
existing card, a 4 meg rage based card, apparently is not well
supported by xorg's code, if the blanker is allowed to kick in, the
recovery when the mouse is moved or a key is hit, is to a totally
trashed screen & one must find the pager and switch screens to effect
a redraw.  Minor detail, but a pita anyway.

Thanks a bunch.
