I am having oops reported from my slackware-current install with the 2.4.3-pre7 kernel I can't seem to find the actual oops txt in any of my logs.

So, here's what I have.

>From my logs:
gpm [122]: Oops() invoked from gpm.c [962]
gpm [122]: /dev/mouse: no such file or directory

I have devfs enabled and my mouse is USB (IMPS/2) so I didn't actually have a /dev/mouse.
the rc.gpm incorrectly pointed gpm to /dev/mouse.  When I fixed it, the oops went away.

If anyone can tell me where the default slackware puts oops info, I'll gladly put it here.
