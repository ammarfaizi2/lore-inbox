Or simply a dead drive. (or a "dirty" cable -- try re-plugging that one.)
I'm guessing the machine was powered off after being hacked and now some
of the drives don't work so well anymore. (such is the way of things with
cheap IDE drives -- and even cheap SCSI ones too. all too often, they don't
even spin back up.)
