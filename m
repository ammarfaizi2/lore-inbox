"Talk to a lawyer..." Good copout. I have talked to lawyers
about Linux, GPL, etc. "Don't touch that stuff with a 10-foot
pole," is the response. A couple years ago, I was all set to
make some very smart WiFi routers using Linux in a closely-held
company that I had invested in. We built prototypes and were
performing measurements for FCC approval. After buying a $15k
spectrum analyzer, we needed more money to advertise and start
production. A quick trip to a lawyer queered the deal. Undaunted,
we went to another lawyer with another investor. We couldn't get
any funding and had to give it up. Then Linksys got into that
area and you know the rest. We had a two-year head start.
Fortunately we didn't give up the "day jobs".

It's all about managing risk. Lawyers want to minimize risk,
accountants want to eliminate risk, engineers want to analyze
risk, and entrepreneurs want to manage risk. Software engineers
have a better "handle" on the risk analysis than the lawyers.
Let them be heard.

Cheers,
