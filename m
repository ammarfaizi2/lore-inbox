Andre,

I can see where you are coming from on this, but nevertheless, the NDA
is not enforcable if illegal activities are taking place. Ask your legal
council and they should be able to confirm this. If what you are fearing
is economical retaliation from the companies that made you sign an NDA
to ensure your silence, the legal system of US should protect you from
that.

All I can say, if US law require you to cover up illegal/criminal
activity because you signed an NDA, get the f*ck out of US jurisdiction
as fast as you can.

I am living in the UK at the moment, and I can not thoroughly recommend
that as an alternative to living in the US. There are countries with
better legal systems in the EU than what UK has.

Just my two pennies worth.
