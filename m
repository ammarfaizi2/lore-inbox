Porting wpi

When asked the likelihood that the wpi driver would be ported to
Linux, Damien thought that this was unlikely. "I doubt the Linux
community will ever leverage this work since Intel is developing a
802.11 layer for the Linux kernel," he said, "Linux kernel developers
probably can't afford to upset Intel."
