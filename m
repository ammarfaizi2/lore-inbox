His point and direction (or lack thereof) are easy to see, and 
consistent. Linux has been a war of attrition
with an interesting rat's maze model of human intereaction -- always 
interesting to see new mice traverse the
maze (only there's no cheese at the end of this maze -- just the smell 
of cheese -- the cheese is on Linus'
desk outside the maze, and all the mice inside the maze are madly 
looking for it, and being driven
quite mad). :-)

Cheers,

Jeff
