I was wondering why video drivers are not part of the kernel like every 
other piece of hardware. I would think if video drivers were part of the 
kernel and had a nice API for X or any other windowing system, would not 
only improve performance but would allow competing windowing systems 
without having to develop drivers for each. Has anyone thought or 
rejected this idea.

Anyway, This was running though my head for a long time and just thought 
I ask.
