   I know the GPL and I know they don't appear to be doing any of these
two things. However it might be hidden in some obscure agreement between
Free and the user, renounced upon in such an agreement (which would
violate the GPL, like QuakeLives did) or indeed not be there at all. And
the only people who can verify this are the Freebox users.

   As stated in my previous email, I agree with you on this. Renting is
distributing.
