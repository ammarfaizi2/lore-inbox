   I've had a pile of old stuff from 1993->1995 that escaped due to freak
   chance and non reuse of an old disk. I've now rescued the data and finally
   had time to strip the original Linux lists out of it. I dont have 1991/1992 
   alas but hopefully someone else does. Ted used to have them on tsx-11
   I believe /

I have archives from 1991-1994 at:

	ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/mail-archives

Any budding historian/archivist want to try to merge the two archives
together?:-)

   Anyway if you want to know what DaveM's first post looked like, read the
   very first Linux code freeze announcement or just wondered what a 5 mail
   a day kernel list was like..
