Hello,

I have a system with two different PCI cards. I am
writing the driver for one of those cards. However I
have the source for the other driver. 

My requirement is to access the memory of other PCI
device (other device has it's own memory) from my
driver.
How to do this?
Are there any restrictions to do so?

Have a nice time.
Regards
Arun
