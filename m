The problem is that copy-protection will only be effective
if you impose Soviet style restrictions on the use of computers.

Certain powerful corporations want effective copy-protection.
Ergo, those powerful corporations will want to impose Soviet
style restrictions on the use of computers.

The attempt will ultimately fail.  So did the Soviet Union, but
in the meantime the attempt to make it work was, and will be,
something of an inconvenience.
