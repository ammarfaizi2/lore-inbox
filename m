Because we dropped the the request has been returned to the sane 128
sectors and not the default block broke value of 255 which is not 256 the
real performance gainer.

echo max_kb_per_request:256 > /proc/ide/hda/settings

Do this and you will have a 5-10% performance gain.

Yeah the name max_kb_per_request is wrong but I want to report sectors and
not what the filesystem minimum base wants.
