Hello sorry to interupt ur work, i was a subscriber to the kernel mailing 
list before and realise how much traffic you get.

My friend has a DIAMOND homefree network card using HPNA
i was wondering what hte status of HPNA is in the kernel?
to refresh HPNA allows you to network ur machines via the phone lines  in 
america.

Kind Regards
Peter Revilll
