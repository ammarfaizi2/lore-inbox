Matti,

My recollection as a 50+ american is that the household cleaner Mr. Clean 
has been around since at least the 1960's.  I remember vividly the TV 
advertisements with the bald headed genie (or whatever) with his arms 
crossed and inspecting dirt or cleanliness or whatever.  With my US-centric 
upbringing, I think that Mr. Clean originated here and then went overseas, 
with appropriate translations of the product name, hence the appearance of 
Mr. Proper.

That's what I know about Mr. Clean vs. Mr. Proper.  I believe it correct, 
but I'm not a Procter & Gamble historian.

David
