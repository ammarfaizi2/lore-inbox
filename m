Subject: unnecessary disk writes for named pipe inodes (2.4.21)
X-Mailer: VM 7.03 under Emacs 19.34.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm afraid I don't have a patch or a comprehensive description of the
exact problem parameters, but I think I have fairly conclusive
evidence of a kernel infelicity.

Summary of my conclusions: the kernel will sometimes schedule an
unnecessary write of the inode of a named pipe, if the pipe is
carrying data.  The written-out inode is identical to that already on
the disk.  On laptops the needless disk use is particularly harmful.


Description of symptoms, investations and experiments carried out:

Originally I was running 2.4.19 and I noticed that since I had started
to run some homegrown VPN software (userv-ipif) on my laptop, it would
repeatedly spin up and spin down the hard disk in an annoying and
battery-consuming way.  This behaviour would cease if I shut down the
VPN tunnel.  Naturally I suspected an infelicity in my VPN application
(which is a somewhat Heath Robinson contraption of userv, cat, ssh,
slip-over-pty, udp, etc.) and spent some time stracing various
processes and looking for changing files, with no luck.

I did a small amount of research and found Jens Axboe's laptop mode
patch (http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/653/3131), which I applied to a
fresh 2.4.21 tree (minus the bdflush parameters change).  Using the
block_dump sysctl I watched to see what the disk activity was.  The
activity was frequent writes of two blocks.  I saw:
 kernel: kupdated: WRITE block 262848/8 on 03:02
 kernel: kupdated: WRITE block 1835600/8 on 03:02

I had a little difficulty converting those block numbers to inode
numbers.  debugfs won't do this for you if the block is in an inode
table, so you have to do it by hand using the information about block
groups it gives you.  But, I managed to convert them into two inode
number ranges 18688-18719 and 114240-114271.  Searching the output of
find -xdev -ls | sort enabled me to spot likely candidates, and I
found one plausible hit for each: /dev/xconsole (a named pipe) and
/var/run/userv/socket (an AF_UNIX socket).

Viewing /dev/xconsole with ls -l{,c,u} showed that its timestamps were
being changed continually at least as seen by userspace processes.
But debugfs `stat /dev/xconsole' showed old, unchanging, timestamps.

Viewing /var/run/userv/socket with both ls -l{,c,u} and debugfs showed
no ongoing changes to its timestamps, so I was suspicious about my
conclusion that it was relevant.  I removed it and arranged for it to
be recreated with a significantly different inode number by creating
many inodes on the filesystem.  Sure enough, one of the two written
blocks changed to include the new location, as expected.  However,
userv creates a bunch of named pipes in /var/run/userv for each call,
and these later become anonymous, so it may be that it was these for
the ongoing call which were at issue, and not the socket itself.

In my final experiment/workaround, I made /var/run/userv, and
/dev/xconsole, symlinks into a ramfs filesystem.  This has stopped the
spurious hard disk spinups and will do as a workaround for now.

So, I conclude that something in the kernel was deciding to write out
these two inodes to disk without good reason.  I don't know what the
policy is for what the on-disk timestamps for named pipes should be,
but there is definitely no point writing out the inode with the old,
unchanging, timestamps.


Background on my system and setup:

I'm running Debian potato on a Sony Vaio PCG-Z505R.  The kernel is a
nearly stock 2.4.21 compiled in the normal way (without using Debian's
kernel building scheme or any patches apart from the laptop mode
patch).  I had to fix a couple of trivial rejects when applying the
patch.  In case it's relevant I include a copy of the .config.
The filesystem in question is /, ext2, hda2, mounted rw,noatime.

/dev/xconsole is a named pipe which was originally created once when I
set things up and is not usually messed with.  At the time of the
spurious disk spinups two processes show up in fuser as having it
open: syslogd and a copy of cat which I'm running in an xterm to print
the messages.  It may be that no messages need appear for the disk to
spin up, although it's difficult to be sure of the reason for the
spinup when no messages appear as this pipe and cat was the route I
was using to get the block_dump information.

userv is GNU userv-1.0.1.1potato from Debian.  /var/run/userv/socket
is an AF_UNIX socket it (unlinks and) creates when it starts up, and
on which it listens for connections from the userv client program.  At
the time of the spurious disk spinups there are no new userv
invocations happening, and one ongoing userv invocation which started
a little while ago for the VPN client.  The main uservd is waiting in
accept on the socket.  The current userv call has a number of
processes; some of these copy data in and out via named pipes which
were deleted shortly after the call started, and these pipes _are_
active in my setup.  I would not be at all surprised if the inode
numbers of these named pipes were nearby to those for
/var/run/userv/socket itself.

The VPN client is userv-ipif (from userv-utils 0.2.1).  At the time of
the unwanted disk activity, all of its processes are idle except:
* the udptunnel-forwarder, a C program which occasionally (every 60s
  or so) wakes up to send or receive a keepalive packet;
* several copies of cat which do data shuffling between various
  named pipes originally created in /var/run/userv, unnamed pipes, and
  a pty in SLIP mode.
None of this should require disk activity during normal operation, as
I can see when I use the ramdisk kludge described above and by
stracing various processes.  But, note that the keepalive packets do
pass through the named pipes and through the pty.

The tunnel does report its messages to syslog, when there are any, but
during my tests there weren't except at startup.

My theory about why shutting down the VPN tunnel would make the
spurious hard disk activity go away is as follows: with the VPN
tunnel, the now-anonymous named pipes from /var/run/userv are
periodically used by the userv call, and so the kernel writes those
inodes out (unchanged, though) each time.  This causes a block_dump
message, which in turn makes /dev/xconsole need updating too.

Thanks for your attention.

Ian.
