Editor's note:  This story is reproduced in part, with links to the author's original.  More of own military personnel have now been killed than the combined deaths of Israelis and Palestinians at the time of this story was penned, not to mention the deaths of civilian, missionaries, reporters, and uncounted Iraqis. It is indeed time to "fix the blame." Our political leaders do not accept it.

THE CAUSE OF THE CONFLICT PART 1: FIXING THE BLAME
Charles E. Carlson, July 07, 2002

The terrible war between Israel and Palestine that erupted in a second uprising of the prisoners (Intifada II) 20 months ago has claimed over 2,000 Palestinian lives and almost 600 Israelis. It is time to name and condemn the responsible parties. Only then can the killing stop. 
CLIP:

Naming the guilty parties is easy because they have come forward publicly to name themselves. The guilty are neither the Palestinian nor the Israeli people. At the root of the problem is a race-hate cult (mostly of "Christian" leaders) that has emerged under American Zionist leadership. Without this unholy alliance there would have been no uprisings, because the West Bank and Gaza would not have become occupied territories.

Ralph Reed, Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party and former executive director of Pat Robertsons Christian Coalition, and Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, founder of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, have become co-chairmen of a new anti-Islamic hate group called the "Stand for Israel" campaign." Southern Baptists Jerry Falwell and Oliver North, and many others have expressed support for the campaigns goal of recruiting 100,000 churches and a million Christians to "support Israel".

Rabbi Eckstein describes "Stand for Israel" as the "the Christian AIPAC" (American Israeli Political Affairs Committee). Please see our report on an AIPAC meeting held on May 13, 2002. At that meeting the National Anthem of Israel was sung, but not the Star Spangled Banner.
Clip:

Note that AIPAC is called "American," but it is controlled by Israel. "Stand for Israel" will also be controlled by Israel.

The "Stand for Israel" campaign is a hate group pitting Christians against Muslims and led by Israeli Patriots. The Southern Baptist Convention is for Israel and against Islam. Our source is the Christian leaders own words. Let us quote some of its founders and most powerful supporters:
CLIP:

Here is the text of the statement by Jerry Vines, outgoing president of the SBC: "Islam is founded by Mohammed, a demon-possessed pedophile who had 12 wives, and his last one was a nine-year old girl." (emphasis added) So said Reverend Vines.
Richard L. Land, a Harvard-educated spokesman for the SBC, obviously thinks Southern Baptist ethics do not preclude slandering another religion, if that religion is an enemy of Israel. What has Dr. Land said about the ethics of Catholic leaders on the subject of pedophilia? Very little said, judging from the SBC website. Dr. Land saves his attacks for enemies of Israel--the hapless Palestinians, some of whom are Baptists, too, and among whom, crimes like this are virtually unheard of.

In its condemnation of Mohammed, the Southern Baptist leadership did not mention the well-known rules for pederasty set out in Israelis state religion, Judaism, in the 5th century Talmud, gross and ugly as they are (Sanhedrin 55b-55a). Rabbi Eckstein could no doubt enlighten Mr. Land about what the Talmud says.
CLIP:

"God made an unconditional covenant (with the present day state of Israel), and he doesn't negotiate. Its Gods way or the highway."  

These are not just hot words from a cold pulpit; they were delivered at a June 10 press briefing at the Southern Baptist Convention at the American Center in St. Louis. They are Dr. Lands crass way of saying Palestinian families should hit the road and turn over their land to the state of Israel, because he thinks they did not get their land title from God. Dr. Land, like so many others, does not tell the Palestinians which highway to use or which desert they should march out into. His interpretation of scripture dictates that each family give up all its worldly property and leave...or die like many already have.

Land continued: "Supporting Israel is a matter of being obedient to God."  
Ariel Sharon embraces the Celebrity Christians fondly as "Christian Zionists," but he makes no secret of his own heathenism. 

Recently Sharon told the American Congress he knows the land of Palestine was given to the Zionists because "the Pope told me so." Sharon loves to joke of those who believe in God.

Whatever became of the "Christian Right"? Dr. Land provides a childish explanation which he no doubt expects every Baptist to understand from the footnotes of his Scofield or McArthur Study Bible. These are the incredible words Dr. Land has publicly proclaimed:
 "God has blessed them (referring to Arabs), and He will continue to bless them everywhere but Palestine, because God gave Palestine to the descendants of Isaac forever."

Lands logic is explained in the heretical footnotes of Oxford University Press' own dispensationalist bible, custom written in 1962 and named the Scofield Study Bible (to be discussed in detail in our next edition). 
CLIP:

Dr. Land quotes almost word-for-word from the Oxford bibles heretical footnotes, composed by unknown and unspecified authors 500 or more years after the King James Edition was written.

The SBC interprets the ancient Hebrew Scriptures found in Genesis as if they were written in 1948. The reason for this is that the Oxford Press rewrote the Baptists favorite Bible in 1962 to accommodate the creation of the state of Israel 14 years before. In other words, a secular publisher rewrote Genesis by adding and changing hundreds of pages of interpretive footnotes, some of which recognized "Israel" as a state, and declared it a national sin not to support the Israeli government.
CLIP:

Worst of all, based upon Dr. Lands (and Rabbi Eckstien's) interpretation of these footnotes, we are supposed to decide who lives and who dies in the Middle East.

Had Oxford University Press known they could get away with it in 1962; they might have inserted a footnote about Prophet Mohammed that made him out to be a "demon-possessed pedophile." After all, Mohammed was born well before 1962, so why not put him in too?
CLIP:

Dr. Land wills that the Arabs should leave. He makes no concession for the Christian Arabs in Palestine, which includes some of my own friends who live in Gaza and attend the Baptist Church there. Land says they must hit the "highway" because God gave the land they live on to someone called Jacob who fathered a different tribe. Thus, on account of their race, they must die or starve, even if they are Baptists. How racist can you get? Does this also apply to Arab Jews in Gaza, of whom there are quite a few, I am sure?

Not a single Israeli of any religion can prove himself to be in direct lineage to someone three thousand years ago. This is also true of the rest of us, no matter how tidy the family records. Yale University geneticist Mazim Qumseyeh has told We Hold These Truths that the DNA evidence is not available and that the Arab Palestinian is genetically similar to the Arab Jew.

The Baptist Church of In Gaza City is located between the Library of Culture and Light and the Islamic Center on Omar Mukhter Boulevard. There I met and interviewed three Christian Arab members who consider themselves Baptists. Some of them have already been bombed by the Israelis. One, who asked that I not use his name, (Mr. J.) had to find a new school for his two boys because the Israelis had bombed their school into rubble a few days before I arrived. They used American-made F-16s and 500-pound American Smart Bombs.

Dr. Land and his allies would, of course, approve of this raid, because they believe the Israelis are of Jacobs seed and the Arabs are of Ishmaels. But they have no shred of evidence for either belief, except in the footnotes of the Oxford Bible and its several prosperous imitators. 

Does Dr. Land have a special "dispensation" to protect Mr. J s children, when the rest of the Arabs have to hit the "highway?" Does he really believe Israelis from Russia should occupy Mr. Js land that his family has owned for hundreds of years?

SHERRY'S WAR - How Judeo-Christians mix and match scripture verses and use of extra text out of context to promote the Pop Church's "chosen people" and end times scenario. Sherry, and many well-meaning, professed Christians have justified war against Arab people without a scrap of scriptural support and with little knowledge of the conflict. "Sherry's War" offers insight into current Christian sub-culture and why many have justified or ignored entirely the brutal assassinations of Islamic peoples simply because they are not Israelis or Christian. A must read for every pastor, deacon, priest and cleric seeking the true nature of Judeo-Christianity.
