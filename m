Dou you know a nice thing?  We (as in the Linux Community) don't have to
compete with anyone.  Sure, we're usually trying to be better than
anyone else, but unlike companies under maret pressure we can wait until
something is ready.

Again, if you think you want your work in Linux cooperate with the Linux
Developers, and as you have seen in this thread there's a pretty broad
consensus that we want things working at the VFS (and actually working
of course)
