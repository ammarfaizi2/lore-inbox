Hi,

I compiled kernel 2.4.18 for my friend running athlon
KM133 via686a audio and he told me that he got some
problem with X, it sounds to me that he got video
problem. I am not sure if this problem fixed in
2.4.19preX or I should do something to work around it.
For now he has to use 2.4.17. 

Please CC me as I am not subscribed.

Thanks,
