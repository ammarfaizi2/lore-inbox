that symbols must be EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL...  Could you point that out?

The 3 or 4 lines of code that I wrote as an original expression before
the patch was submitted.

No, just a declaration: the code in question was released under GPL
Version 2.

Yes, perhaps I should have said "original" instead of "novel".  The patch
is not "original" as it was predated by equivalent (machine translatable)
original expressions.
