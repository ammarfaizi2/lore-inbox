  "them", not "him".
But the ISP's are using softwares which enable them to shoot themselves
on their feet/head quite nicely, we don't need to do any additional effort
there.

And for that matter, for some reason (maybe because most of the world is
running with sendmail ?) most of the time we see failures, there is
a sendmail which is failing to work as it is supposed to.
