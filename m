You need to build an initrd for that to work.  That is actually handled by 
the scripts in the initrd, so without those...

One workaround to get the ramdisk without having to use modules goes like 
this:

Do a make modules_install anyway.  That sets up the directory layout in 
/lib/modules, without which mkinitrd fails.  Remove any modules that get 
installed (2.4 makefiles will probably build and install modules even if 
CONFIG_MODULES is not set).

Then build the kernel and do a make install, and the /sbin/installkernel 
script will do the right thing.

Not tested, but given my understanding of how RH8 boots, should work.

Or else just pass the device.
