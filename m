Hee hee.  The Other Shoe Drops.  This ought to be written down as
  Some-and-Such's Law: All Open Source Debates Will Continue Until Someone
  Tells Someone Else to Shut Up and Code It.  ;)

Actually, I'm highly, highly tempted.  Only problem is that I have a
  ton of other projects that require my attention.  If someone wants to
  fight the CAP server and collaboration battles, I will.  Otherwise,
  it'll have to wait until after I finish the projects I currently have
  on the table.  :/

Or maybe if someone will get my professors off my back (and fill my brain
  with the material so that I don't need to learn QM or E&M)  ;)   Aaah,
  my good friend Jackson....

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive? http://swpat.ffii.org/players/microsoft
