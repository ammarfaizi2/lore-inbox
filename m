My post was intended to make people realize how ti fit into the existing
structure, I am not saying that the structure is fundmentally broken and
needs to be scrapped.

the fundamental existing process has been far more sucessful then the more
formal procedures that are allocated, people just need to realize what is
going on and not expect things to happen that won't.
