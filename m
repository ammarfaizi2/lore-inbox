Filesystems shouldn't be overloading vm_operations on ordinary files, or so
I've been instructed.

Judging by the CodingStyle doc - which you like throwing at me - it should be
split into a separate inline function. I could come up with a better name, I
suppose to keep Willy happy too - perhaps make_pte_writable(); it's just that
I wanted to name it to show its derivation.
