Honestly I haven't had time to read it over and compare and contrast
with the IBM paper. From the sound of things though, I suspect both your
patch and the IBM code implement the same thing: an infrastructure
allowing "governors" to control dynamic scaling. The 405LP code also
includes such a governor of course. The ideas may be almost identical;
I'm not sure anyone's compared at this point. Do you have the time? ;)
