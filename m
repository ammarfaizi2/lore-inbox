Hi Martin,

I'm having problems booting a 2.5.23 kernel on my test box (SMP). It hangs on
trying to recalibrate the IDE interface. I've attached the output captured
from the serial console. I've also attached the config file.

Note that trying the following doesn't help:

	(*) Turning on and off "Use PCI DMA by default when available".
	(*) Specifying "hda=dma" on the kernel command line
	(*) Specifying "hda=935,128,63" on the kernel command line

Can you suggest a fix please?

David
