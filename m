This is a lot less draconian/elitist than banning ISPs. People
seldom have a choice between multiple ISPs that offer affordable
high-speed connections. Consider yourself lucky if both DSL and
cable modem service are available and affordable in your area.

Banning Outlook isn't so bad. Assuming you are stuck with Windows,
you still have many choices. Netscape/Mozilla and Eudora would be
the obvious choices. I think you can get pine. Emacs has been
ported to Windows, so you have the rmail/gnus stuff. Surely you
can tolerate at least one of these many choices.
