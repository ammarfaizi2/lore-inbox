Yes, but how could I know if the bug is in XFree86? in kernel? in the
nvidia driver module? and no, I can't even hope to try to reproduce bugs
without nvidia module, because no X =3D> no bugs. If you tell me what I
need to add to kernel configuration to get some info while something
happens, I'll probably try to reproduce bugs when test10 is out with
vanilla kernel.

And yes, I'm intrested in the performance of other's computers too, but
if this is new then it's new, and I can't by my self know where the bug
(maybe) is.

Regards,
Markus
