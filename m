Sorry, probably missed you out.

The key you signed this e-mail with (6eeaf716) is available on
wwwkeys.pgp.net, but I cannot find your other key (99ed3565), and this
was the key listed as missing in my original post.

Spam is something that affects us all. Use procmail and/or spamassassin.
Probably works better anyway, because sooner or later your address will
end up in some e-mail...
