Please elaborate what do you mean "stoped to work"?
Only silent output, DMA not working, or what?

Also, more hardware detail is needed - which machine and which codec?

This kind of problem is likely due to a broken BIOS.  The current code
parses the default pin configuration set up via BIOS while the older
version used  the fixed pin assignment (depending on the codec chip,
though).
In most cases, it can be recovered by specifying a proper model module
option.  See ALSA-Configuration.txt for details.
