You're right to point out the pitfalls that others have found in such paths
before - it's informative, and it's interesting. Personally I think I'd rather 
walk down that path, trying to avoid known pitfalls, than try your new
path, but I'll be delighted to see how your concept works out in practice. 
Good luck to you.

I still think (see my previous email) that we're actually heading to more or
less the same place from different directions, which was actually my main
point.

Time will tell ;-)

Martin.
