No need whatsoever, he managed that fine all by himself. It's rare to see  
such a concentrated amount of stupidity-by-being-too-lazy-to-do-trivial- 
research on a technical mailing list.

Of course, whoever thinks Bradley made some profound point must be asked  
the same question - what made it impossible for you to do a trivial amount  
of research so you would not utter so incredibly embarassing stupidity?
