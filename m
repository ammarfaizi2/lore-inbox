Subject: moving the BitBucket GPL discussion to a context with
   potential for _progress_
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org



[PLEASE ... DO NOT followup without trimming the addressees.]

	David Lang (on lkml, in the context of a partly interesing
	revision control system discussion):

        hey guys, the suggestion to move to another list for this
        discussion was to reduce traffic on the kernel list, not add a
        bunch of arch discussions to the bitkeeper discussions.


First, please tolerate _some_ (hopefully very _short_ term)
cross-posting as a tactic to move the discussion to the
arch-users@lists.fifthvision.net list.  Honestly, I think a few
redundant declarations on lkml can help with the medium-to-longer-term
movement of traffic off of lkml.  (Not that your plea is inconsistent
with that.)

Second, I personally (taking a risk here) think it's reasonable to use
arch-users for more than just the narrow arch topic -- for the whole
lkml-vs.-bk issue, for example.  arch-users are already learning from
these lkml threads.  If you're *really* off-topic on arch-users, but
have made what you think is an enriching post, just put "OT:" in the
subject line (but, hey, make it a _high quality_ post, whatever that
means).

Third, in the arch world, I think we're really open-minded and
interested about revision control in general -- we're thinking a lot
about design issues -- not slavishly devoted to just a narrow
conception of arch.  Projects that compete with arch -- developers of
competing systems -- let's (M. Grubb, forgive me for not getting prior
permission :-), gather on arch-users for rational discourse.

I'll leave you with the enclosed, from arch-users.  We _are_ conscious
of de-noisifying lkml (and not needlessly noisifying any other list or
mbox).

Subject: [arch-users] the "zen" of lkml

Here, let me try to say nothing at all:

*) On the one hand, if several of us say essentially the same
   thing on lkml, but in different terms, that greatly increases
   the chances of achieving communication.


*) On the other hand, if several of us say essentially the same
   thing on lkml, but in different terms, that greatly increases
   the chances of dragging out an unwelcome thread.


I don't know what that means but it sounds important so keep it in
mind.
