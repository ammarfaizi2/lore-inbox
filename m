I can write the firmware on a CD and use an XP machine in several 
places, but then I have no place to stick the floppy after I write it...

Guess I can try writing the floppy as a 1.44 bootable image on a CD, but 
that is really ugly. A lot of people say they have given up Windows, but 
the hardware vendors haven't.

Thanks for the pointer in any case, it looks as if my P4P800-E mobo will 
need the same flash, I'll stick a floppy in that one when I assemble it.
