Hi all,

I have been advised by Russell King on arm linux mailing list to ask my 
question here.

I've been trying to contact device@lanana.org to get some minors and dev 
name
attribuated more than a week ago now. I think I stricly followed the 
email format requested
by LANANA folks (Torben Mathiasen is all alone to maintain the list, 
right ?).

I understand that the process could take a while but as I do not get any 
answer at all
(even an automatic one) I was wondering whether LANANA is still active 
or not ?
Maybe my request was simply rejected ?

I would apreciate being taught how to get minors and dev names 
attribuated in the case
of LANANA is not active anymore.

I have seen in the LKML FAQ that Documentation/devices.txt is maintained by
H.Peter Anvin. Is  this FAQ  still  up-to-date  ? Or is there something 
I am missing ?

Thanks !
