I have the last 2.5.x kernels experienced a high load while idle. 1.00
mostly. I have dual cpu, and it isn't really bothering me. But I do not
experience this with 2.4.x kernels. I do not remember when this started,
but since noone else complains, I just want to ask how can I find out
what is making my load so high?

Regards,
Stian
