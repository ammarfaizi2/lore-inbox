What happened to your peyote-based cure for arthritis? I can't seem to 
find either timpanogas.org or utah-nac.org at the moment.

Now, far be it for this old Coyote to sense something amiss in a person 
who's associated with both SCO and a controlled substance. Yes, I'm 
aware of recent Utah Court rulings; they only apply to members of the 
Native American Church.

Not that SCO would mind "tainting" Linux by associating its developers 
with an illegal substance...

Gosh darn, there I go again, getting all conspiratorial...
