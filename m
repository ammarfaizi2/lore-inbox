well VIA powered up their public site (www.viaarena.com) or whatever and
on the instant I put query of where all the datasheets have vanished.
(I managed at one point to download quite thoughout documentation about
VT82C598MVP but it has since vanished from their site)

They even replied to my post
"http://forums.viaarena.com/messageview.cfm?catid=6&threadid=103"

                    Hi Epa, 

                    The list of datasheets currently available is here.
Some are not full versions, some are. If you want/need a datasheet, please
complete the request form on that page.

So I completed the request form and never heard from them again.
Too familiar? I thought so.
