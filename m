God, I can't believe this epidemic of bitching about gas prices has
invaded LKML of all places.

Take the fucking bus, ride a bike, or just fucking move closer to work.
What ever gave all you people the idea that driving 50 miles each way to
work was sustainable in the first place?  I can't believe how many
otherwise rational people have a gigantic blind spot for this.
