Pending approval by Jeff Dike we should probably remove this from "ready to 
merge" to "sitting on the floor but still warm".  The current UML patch for 
2.5 only works with versions 2.5.3-pre2 and below.  I am working on getting 
it up to speed with 2.5, but I'm new to this and its slow work.  If I can get 
it up to speed I'll try and keep it prepared for merging as my academic 
schedule permits.
