I don't know if Pine lets you -w the called Pico. I only use Pico (and ed
and sam). -w still wordwraps at about 500 characters also, which breaks
some of the more demented GNU autoautomakemake stuff, which is a good
thing.

The quintessential Linux editor is probably the microemacs on kernel.org,
which is probably the one Torvalds used to use from Minix to the mid-90s. 
The Amiga 1000 came with that. I couldn't believe it. Fortunately the
Amiga also had Matt Dillon's dme, which came with his C compiler. Nysche.
He doesn't feel like translating Intuition to X though. Bummer.
