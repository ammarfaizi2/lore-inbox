   I don't know about vmware (probably applies too) but more than one
   person at Veritas can be justly offended by your implication that
   Veritas employees have not contributed anything useful to the Linux
   kernel.

If such a misconception exists (incorrect or not), it would be helped
if the majority of people who do Linux kernel work and are working at
these companies didn't use foo@yahoo.com (or other anonymous) email
addresses in their postings here.

The Vger postmasters knows who you cowards really are, because we see
the final destination when your email bounces :-))))
