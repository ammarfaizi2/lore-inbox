Hello,

I wan't to install Linux on a Raid0-Partition, which is created with a
Raid-Controller. The chipset is CMD680. This chipset is allready known
from linux, but it seems there is no way to get an hardware array
working. Maybe I'm to dumb to do it. I don't know, how to write a driver
or a patch.

Hope that there is a way to get it work.

Sorry for my bad english.

You guys are doing a great job!

Mike Greubel
