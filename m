Hi all,

Does anybody in this list know why the IP1000 driver is not
included in the kernel? Has the author submitted it in the
past for inclusion?

The card in question is:

Sundance Technology Inc IC Plus IP1000

and the driver can be found in sundance web, sources 
included. I tried to contact the author but my email
bounced.

There's no LICENSE in the source, just copyrigth
sentences in the .c files, so i'm not sure under
which license it's distributed :-?.

regards,
