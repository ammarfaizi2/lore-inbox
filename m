It's many months old and there are several versions around.
A similar one is YAHA. And it doesn't just take the addresses
from the Outlook addressbook - it scans the OE cache too, so
if your address appears on a webpage (say a list archive) that
an infected users visits your address is added to the list as well.

The mindless jerks who wrote Outlook and the KLEZ and YAHA viruses will
be the first against the wall when the revolution comes. Well,
just after the mindless jerks of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation,
ofcourse.
