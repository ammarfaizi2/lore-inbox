What you me "we" here? Linus owns the trademark, he makes the decisions. I
can give him the name of a lawyer who did patent and trademark for GE for
decades, but I can't give him any advice. This is not a gut feel decision,
and "cower" sure sounds gut feel to me. That's probably not the optimal
consideration in this case. Failing to defend can mean losing a challenge
as well as doing nothing, the only advice I have on that is "consult a
good lawyer."
