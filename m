On my machine, the current 2.5.70 bk tree has a serious problem.
Using RH8.0 it will not complete the normal user graphical login.
Machine is alive, and can access it via console and other non-graphical login.

One of the gnome processes or ssh-agent gets hung?

  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  755 ?        00:00:00 gnome-session
  790 ?        00:00:00 ssh-agent
  793 ?        00:00:00 gconfd-2
  795 ?        00:00:00 bonobo-activati
  797 ?        00:00:00 metacity
  800 ?        00:00:00 gnome-settings-

2.5.70 is okay; it might be a recent change that broke part of the
networking or IPC.
