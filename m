FROM: GREY KOFI 
ADMIN.SECRETARY STANDARD SECURITIES. 
ACCRA, GHANA. 
DEAR SIR, 

I do hope this letter will not come to you as a 
surprise. It was borne out of my desire to share a 
mutual business relationship with you . 
My name is GREY KOFI. A 47 years Ghanaian national, 
married with a wife and four children. I work as an 
administrative secretary 
in Standard Securities and Services Limited 
in Accra-Ghana. 
I got the information concerning you from the Ghana 
Chambers of Commerce and Industries after due 
consultation with my opinion adviser, I decided to 
contact you believing that by the grace of God, you 
will accept to be my partner in this business. 
I joined the services of this company in 1991 as 
office assistant and have been working with this company for 
nine years, within this period, I have worked with 
states and government functionaries who have been 
using Standard Securities to move huge sums of money 
U.S Dollars, Pounds Sterling, Foreign 
Tiakh(Cash)to their foreign partners. 
They bring in these consignments of money cash and 
secretly declare the contents as jewelry, Gold, 
Diamond, Precious stones, Family Treasure, Documents, 
etc. General Sanni Abacha of Nigeria(dead), Mobutu 
Sese Sekou of zaire (dead) Foday Sankoh of Sierra 
Leone,Babangida of Nigeria etc. All these people have 
hundreds of consignments deposited with Standard 
securities. Their foreign partners friends and 
relatives are claiming most of these consignments, but 
a lot of them are lying here unclaimed for as much 
as fifteen years. 
Nobody has ever come for them because in most cases, 
the documents! of deposits are never available to any 
body except the depositors but most of them are dead. 
Some time last year, Standard Security management 
changed the procedure of claims of consignments.
As 
soon as one is able to supply answers all the test questions 
 as contained in the secret files of any 
consignment, They consignment will be released to you upon demand 
from our safe storage. 
More than one hundred and twenty consignments belonging 

to Gen.Abacha, and Mobutu have been claimed in the past 
months. 
This is why I am soliciting for your co-operation and 
assistance. Gen. Abacha has 85 consignments deposited 
with several different names and codes. 35 have been 
claimed in the past 6 months. Since he died, the 
first son 
also died in a plane crash and the second son is facing 
trial 
for murderand embezzlement. The family members 
are under 
restricted arrest without communication.And can no longer 
tourch or ask of this consignments as the eyes of their goverment 
is on them and their consignment with us has overstayed their grace period
I have finished every arrangement for you to come and 
claim consignment NO: 1201 containing US$ 9,000,000.00 
and consignment NO: 1200 containing US$ 12,000,000.00. 
My duty is to supply you with all the information and 
documents by fax or email which you will use to deal directly 
with the management. The procedure is simple; You will 
apply officially to the Director of Operations of 
Standard Securities for the release of consignments 
NO; 1200 and NO.1201. 
They will demand some documents and Secret Codes. 
Reach me, I will supply you with every detailed 
information and you will fax it to them. As soon as 
they confirm it correct, they will invite you for 
collection. If you do not want to come to Accra, you 
can arrange with them to transfer the consignment 
to anywhere but united States of America on agreement. 
Nobody should ever know that I am involved in this deal 
except the Lawyer who will write an Agreement for us. 
I will suggest upon conclusion, 30% goes to you and 
70% for me. At the successful completion of the deal, 
you will arrange for me and family to come over to 
your country. I am assuring you that this business 
have been arranged for years now. It is very secure and 
risk free. 
Reach me on kofigrey@yahoo.com for further explanation and directives on
the 
procedure, 

God bless you. 

Yours Sincerely, 

GREY KOFI
