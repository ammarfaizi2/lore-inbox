Problem with that edition is quite old. Yes, it's good and the general
guidelines still apply, but the details are obsoleted by the newer
kernels. When I asked the O'Reilly at LWE NY, they told me that the
second edition (which covers 2.4) will be released in May this year.

Another good place to start is of course http://www.kernelnewbies.org/
