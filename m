I also found that last Friday.  At that point, they had a downloadable
demo for Palm IIIx without source (plus sections on the download page
for Palm Vx and source code, both with the comment "coming soon").

I asked them for source code at their only listed email
feedback@linuxda.com.  I got a pretty quick response from
support@linuxda.com that it will be coming soon and I should revisit
their web page to find out.  To that I responded with an email
explaining the situation they got into and asked to upload the source
before I would tell this list, leaving them some slack because of the
weekend.

I have still not received any email response.  On their web site, they
added a demo for Palm Vx but still no source code.

They have a small statement hidden under "OWNERSHIP OF MATERIALS" saying
that contained open source software is distributed under their own
respective licenses.  That's of course way too buried and a
contradiction.


Oh, and for all you conspiracy theorists out there:

"Empower Technologies Inc., an innovative company based out of Redmond,
Washington."

Redmond and innovation.  Now if that's not suspicious...
