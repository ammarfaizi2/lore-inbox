I would like to be able to do more to help the community, and in particular
you Dave as feature freeze for 2.6 approaches and it becomes critical to 
track things down, but unless a Linux company out there can sponsor me, 
I just won't be able to dedicate more time than I am already dedicating to 
this.

Doing a good job at tracking a gazillion items and bugging people about 
patches and status is just incredibly time consuming.
