Look for a webpage of someone with the laptop you like.
I have a Dell Latitude C600, and found a webpage with
kernel config, and in detail description for every component
and how to get it working / whether it is possible.

I had problems with:
 - acpi (too old / bios no longer updated, but APM might work fine)
 - winmodem (ibm has drivers, dell has not AFAIK)
 - grafik: advanced features like using tv-out and stuff. to be honest
   i found no good docs on that at all, neither generic nor specific.
 - the maestro3 driver caused a problem in the irda driver.

everyone else: please write such webpages, they realy help!

Regards, Andreas
