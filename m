ARAB BANK DU BENIN,(A.B).
BENIN REPUBLIC COTONUO-WEST AFRICA.
TELEPHONE-00229-88-93-70.

Dear friend,

I know this mail will come to you surprisely most especially as we have not 
seen each other neither met  before.

I am  a staff of Arab bank du benin, I got your contact through an internet 
business dossier. I therefore,  decide to contact you on this business 
opportunity.

I am the Chief Inspector of th bank. In the bank's treasury, there is an 
abandoned sum of $6m US dollars (six Million  US dollars), and this huge sum 
of money  belongs to one of our foreign customers who died on a plance crash 
with all the entire family on board. Mr Edmund Miller is from mississippi  
and he died on 31st october 1999  as a result of the plane crash.

Though as one of the senior Managenet staff of the bank, I was shocked about 
the  information as regards to  his death. Since his death, the bank has 
been expecting his next of kin to come  and claim his money as stipulated in 
the bank's policy. It expressely stated  that on event of the death of any 
customer, no fund will be  released to the next of kin unless the person 
applies for it as  a next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in 
our banking guidelines.

But unfortunately and pathetic,  the next of kin or suposed next of kin or 
relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind 
for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to contact you for this 
businness proposal and work out for the bank to release the money to you as 
the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don`t want this money to go 
into the Bank treasury as an unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Beninois cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me. There after, 
I will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages 
indicated
.

To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you if the business 
proposal is accepted by you, an urgent attetion is required as the fund have 
stayed long in the bank. Secondly, the bank will ask us to reactivate the 
account first to be current before the bank can transfer it to  your 
account.

We should  also, understand that we will make some expences before getting 
this fund. You must apply first to the bank as a relation or next of kin of 
the deceased indicating your bank name, your private telephone and fax 
numbers for easy and effective communication and  most importantly, location 
where  the money will be remitted.

Please note, as a banker   I will ensure that  i guide and protect you till 
we get the fund.  And I want you to know that this informmation is given to 
you with uthmost secret.

Please for more clarification, I shall endeavour to give you the bank 
website and that of the  deceased customer for you to verify.


On receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the 
application.  Please be confident and rest assured that the transaction is 
hitch free.

I hope to receiving a reply from you  as soon as you receive the mail.

Thanks,

BAWA SANI
