I should have put a smiley face there. Obviously, "unable to read"
isn't literally true, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to write
devfs in the first place (or Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt, for
that matter), since I wouldn't have been able to read the kernel
sources. I do find the coding style unpleasant, though.

So, I *do* read core kernel code, and can understand it, despite the
appalling coding style.

Hopefully this answers your serious questions, and the matter can be
put at rest.
