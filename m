 DEAR SIR,
 RE: TRANSFER OF $35 MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT
 I, on behalf of my colleagues from different government of Nigeria owned
 establishment, decided to solicit your assistance as regards the transfer
 of the above mentioned amount into your bank account. These funds arose
 from the over invoicing of various contracts awarded in my cooperation
 to certain foreign contractors.
 We as holders of various sensitive position in our various parastatals
 were mandated by the federal government to scrutinize all payments made
 to certain foreign contractors, and we discovered during the scrutiny
 (process) that the sum of $35 million as lying in a suspense account
 although the foreign contractors were fully paid their contractentitlements
 after executing the said contracts.
 We all agreed that the over invoiced amount be transferred (for our own
 use) into a bank account provided by a partner. This is because we are
 government workers and the code of conduct does not allow us to operate
 a foreign account. In this regard we are therefore seeking your assistance
 so that this fund can be speedily processed and fully remitted into your
 nominated bank account. On successful remittance of the fund into your
 account, you will be compensated with 30% of the amount for assistance
 and services. If you accept this proposal, send to me an Email
 1. Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.

 With this information, we are going to put in application anddocumentation,
 making This transaction very legitimate and not  to go against any know
 international law in this way the funds will be transferred by telegraphic transfer to your account for us all.
 Contact me immediately  for further explanation and procedures. Please
 treat with utmost urgency and strict confidentiality.
