I applaud Intel for starting to plug this major hole. This looks
promising.

I took a look at the website and see the GPL driver and the closed
firmware.

Is it is really *firmware*, in that it loads and executes purely within
the Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 itself and not in the linux kernel on the
main CPU? If so, bravo!

Does a similar effort exist for the upcoming Sonoma 802.11a/b/g
component? Will Linux support be available for Sonoma at launch?
