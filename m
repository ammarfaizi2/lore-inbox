I'm interested, more so to be part of a team which as a group is 
responsible for linux-libc-headers. This way if one or two persons 
don't have much time available, the others can share the load.

If there is no-one else willing to maintain linux-libc-headers, I'll be 
more than happy to take it over and try get more developers interested.


Kind Regards
