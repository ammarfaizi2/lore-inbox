Except that we're talking about *hardware* companies here, not
*software* companies. *Hardware* companies make money by selling
*hardware*, not the software that drives it: in fact, they always
distribute the 'software' they write (the drivers) for free (gratis).

So while what you say is perfectly sensible for *software* developers,
it has absolutely nothing to do with the closed source drivers
*hardware* companies distribute.

This all being said, I think that the only thing that can shake
companies such as nVidia and ATI is a project such as the Open
Graphics Card

to succeed.
