Nor has an official product been released.  Reviewing hardware
and software in open development model before it is officially
stamped "final release" is unfair to say the least.  I follow the
agenda list and it is a nice piece of hardware and the software
is coming along quite nicely.  I've heard mostly good stuff about
it so far, although it is not a consumer level product yet - it
is a developers product, for people ready to fire up emacs and
start coding.
