Well pass it to them that I will be happy to fix their problems when it is
a Microsoft problem, but a double or triple the rate.  He needs to get
clue and see that the support contract he will be paying for will exceed

I have no problems with people needed to learn lessons the hardware way
and if you send me his contact information, I will address it for you.
This will explain that he is needed support and that costs money;
regardless, of the OS and hardware.
