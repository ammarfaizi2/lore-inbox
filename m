I am sorry for my last messages.I had made a silly mistake.
I thought I had UHCI Alternate Driver (JE) support compiled in the kernel
but I had compiled it as a module.Now everything works just fine for me.
Too bad for my IntelliEye Mouse because I would like to buy the new
Cordless Optical MouseMan from Logitech... :-)
I am sorry...
