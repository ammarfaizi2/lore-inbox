This is my year-old workstation that I've build from good parts (Asus
A8N-SLI premium, OCZ memory), not overclocked, not overheated (it is
in a Antec P180 case with 12 cm fans -> CPU max is 43'C when not used
for my hour-long simulations).  I will leave it do memtest for a
couple hours.

The compiler is "gcc version 4.1.2 20061028 (prerelease) (Debian
4.1.1-19)" and the .config is attached.
