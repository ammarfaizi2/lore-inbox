Ah, then every ISP in the world belongs on the ORBS list since they all
will indiscriminantly forward their users' mail to other people.  Of
course if someone uses them to deliver spam they usually don't get to keep
their account long, but it's our own fault for using a relay which has
been used to send spam right?

Let's see, ORBS takes out the ISP route, DUL takes out the direct one.  Is
it any wonder people are hostile toward those two lists?
