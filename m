No actually I haven't, (by choice) the FS is now read-only too as it's
"only" /boot.

Actually I didn't believe it at first, so I recovered the files from
backup before I risked a reboot; but when they compared the same as the
backup I tried it anyway. I've also checked all the other filesystems
and done a fresh (verified!) L0 backup. :)

Anyway I might have balanced out a bit on the luck front; I had one of
those 'Oh shit' moments with a 'doze system a couple of days ago.
I thought I was wiping the start of a virtual (vmware) disk ...
