IMHO it's totally impossible at the moment to predict what will happen
to DRM in the future. It can turn the "good" or "bad" way, but nobody
can _yet_ say, which way it'll go. When it's forseeable, it'll be
to late to act against it, if it goes the "bad" one.

Maybe this is only a local problem to germany (I don't think so :) ),
but almost all people I know don't want to know what their computer
does and how it does it. They only want to "write their e-mails"
or only want to "surf in the internet". They don't care about if
they do it with, or without DRM. IMHO exactly this is the danger of the
whole thing. Most people will accept it, although they are a little bit
snipped in their rights and possibilities.
And they'll accept even more and more and more... .
Another point is, that I haven't found anybody in my environment,
that even knows the words DRM or TCPA. Exactly these persons will
accept it, whether it's "good" or "bad".

But on the other side I think the same way, as you, that DRM has
to go into the kernel.
IMHO that's a little bit sad, because we have no really choice,
because over the time all OSs will include it and than linux can't
survive as an outsider in the same form it "survives" today.
