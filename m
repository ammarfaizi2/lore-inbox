After having looked at the issue yearstoday, well I have a rather
trivial question: Can someone recommend me a good call graph generator
for the kernel code? It would be actually helpfull. (No please no
trash in perl or therelike...) Is there already any public
analyzed for the parse tree dumps which can be generated by
GCC 3.xx out there maybe?
