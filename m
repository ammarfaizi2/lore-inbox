See the discussion on this a couple of weeks back.

It is quite correct for the kernel to request that the filesystem set
ctime/mtime on successful calls to open(O_TRUNC).
  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/toc.htm

It is _incorrect_ for it to request that ctime/mtime be set (or that the
suid/sgid mode bit be cleared) if a truncate()/ftruncate() call results
in no size change.
  http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/toc.htm

So the current do_truncate() does have to be changed. Adding a check for
IS_NOCMTIME would be wrong, though.

Cheers,
  Trond
