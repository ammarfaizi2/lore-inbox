I personally have made more than my fair share of off-topic posts.  Some 
of them have been filtered, which really doesn't bother me, because,

Sometimes, I get carried away, but I do keep in mind that off-topic 
posts can be very rude.  I remind myself of this out of respect for 
others on the list.
