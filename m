Nikita, how about phrasing this as:

    `Dear and esteemed potential Reiser4 user, I apologize that we put a 
tarball on our website and let it get so obsolete, thereby wasting your 
time.  I am deleting it now, and will soon put a new one up.  In the 
meantime, can you use bitkeeper if that is convenient for you?  Here is 
the URL with the instructions for doing that.....'

It is the usual American business english used in such cases.;-)
