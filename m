Ok, I've tested part 2 (at91_serial: Fix roundoff error in
at91_console_get_options), and it works on my AT91RM9200-EK board. In
fact, the latest git code does _not_ work -- I see the same garbage as
on ATSTK1000, and this patch fixes it.

Part 3 probably has real problems, and I'm not sure how to fix it. I'll
try some kind of "break timeout" so that any problems will at least be
transient. The current break code works on neither STK1000 nor
AT91RM9200-EK, so even a not-quite-100%-correct fix should be
acceptable, no?

I'm queuing up some patches now that I'll send off as soon as I get them
tested on both ARM and AVR32. This includes the big rename patch I've
been talking about.
