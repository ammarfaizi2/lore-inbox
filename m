Hi all,
	sorry for the offtopic msg.

Can someone point me to a 4 ports fast/eth card solution for linux?

I found some cards based on the DEC 21*4* chips but when
I asked for more details I got a strange answer from the reseller
like that this card is able to work only half-duplex and the chip has
only one mac-address for the 4 eth cards (really strange).

Thanks a lot
Fabbione
