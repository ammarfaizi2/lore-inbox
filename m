Exactly right.

Bann you from the list would go a long way, true; but I oppose such
measures as a matter of principle. Better try to convince the people
out-of-line to do their own soul searching. Hasn't worked so far, sadly.

There was a security problem, I think all agree on that. LKML says any
security problem has to be fixed ASAP, especially if it is well known and
easy to exploit. You say backward compatibility is more important. The
people in charge of the kernel are the ones who decide what to do, in this
case they overwhelmingly decided against you. Though luck.

[Yes, I fully expect you to tell me this is not useful. Perhaps it isn't.
 But continuing to pour gas on the flames (as you are so fond doing)
 doesn't help either.]
