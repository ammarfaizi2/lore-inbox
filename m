They did not and do not show in court anything (and didn't showed
anything that passed the simple checks in other places) though they were
askes several times by the judge.
So AFAICT and IMHO (and IANAL) there is no reason to believe they have
anything (except false accusations, rumors, FUD, creative selection of
truth, and lies).
So even from cursory viewpoint one should primarily see the pure facts
and afterwards (with separate quality) believe in words.
