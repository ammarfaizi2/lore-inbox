> We don't give away our software for free,

	Yes, you do. You can receive a copy of the Linux kernel without paying any
fee or agreeing to any license. You do in fact give away the software for
free.

> we give it away under the
> terms of the GPL,

	That is true. However, the GPL can only grant additional rights, it cannot
take any away.

> you must abide by the terms of the GPL to use it.

	No, that's not true. The law permits the normal expected use simply by
acquiring a copy of the work lawfully. Otherwise, you could buy a book and
then discover that you still had to pay a royalty to read it. Or you could
put a poem on a billboard and sue anyone who read it.

> that is the law, you can wish it wasn't but it is.

	You might try *reading* the law sometime.
