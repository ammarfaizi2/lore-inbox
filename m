Mine is longer, I have more hair, less tummy...

please, stop your childish nonsense.

A fork has sense if latter the code are going to merge
(like gcc/egcs, xfree/xwin, linux/ac/mm/aa/osdl...)
or the proyect are going to take another goal.

But to have two proyects, same code(more or less),
same goal. And it's worse for to be a base crical
package. Its's waste time/resources and to do a little
different every distribution.

-thank you-
