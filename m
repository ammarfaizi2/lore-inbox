		The question is why the utterly beautiful generator was dropped?

		Its good side  was in its inability  to get an invalid kernel
 		 configuration.

		One of the obvious problems is that it was python-based, and thus being slow and
		requiring python to be installed.
		So what if it was written in C?

		Is it possible for it to get in before 2.6?
