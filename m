Yes they can, however, they will be a few issues. Currently the nightly 
and the benchmark summaries are html and posting html is not allowed. 
Converting them to text with URLs unhides the nice way hyperlinks buries 
a long URL and shows a short hyperlink name, thus producing long lines 
that wrap and distort the formatting.  Are the summaries still 
worthwhile without the URLs to the data? For the toplevel summary, 
probably not, and I'm fairly sure this was what you were requesting.

Let me think about how the summaries could be changed to accomodate your 
request. One less link to traverse would be bring the data closer to the 
viewer's eyes and thats a good thing. :)

Thanks for the feedback,

Mark
