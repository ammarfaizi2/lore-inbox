  Folks,

These lists are run in "open for all posters, all topics ok" manner,
mainly because doing closed lists is way larger pain in the rear than
occasional through-leaked spam, or occasional bickering, but ...

.. when most of the list traffic is flame war, I am sorely tempted to 
stomp in with some TABOO-filters..
