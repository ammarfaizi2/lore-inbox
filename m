How bizzarre - I've never seen that
with the nvidia drivers - I gave away
an ATI card to a windoze user since
the ATI DRI would hard lock the box.

(I know, help is on the way, but I had
an immediate need!)

Since switching to a GeForce 2, there
have been no problems whatsoever.

When you say "that only happens" if
you "load the nvidia drivers", do you
mean to say that you only see that
freeze if you run X windows? Or, that
you see it only if you enable DRI?

Lots of things beside nvidia to blame,
if we are on a witchhunt....
