hi,

i was just comipiling 2.4.19 (from kernel.org).
If I decide to include irc-tracking(netfilter) into the kernel I get error when I do "make modules_install".(symbol missing or similar)
When compiled as module everything goes fine ... 
Probably this is some typo...

see ya
raptor

PS. I selected ftp-tracking also to go the kernel.. no problem for it (but it may be is tried after the irc-tracking!!).Aaa and I'm runing Mandrake 8.2 
I have also two paches for FarSync-WAN card and HTB3(qos), but dont think they are the problem...
