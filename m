Hi!

I'm having bad problems with gaim... When I run gaim, my machine tends
to freeze hard (no blinking leds). I'm running vesafb -> that should
rule out X problems. Machine is rather strange pre-production athlon64
noteook, but I'm running 32-bit (on 32-bit kernel), and I can run gaim
under 2.4.X kernel.

[Ugh, I was running with kgdb, but I recall same problem before, too.]

Does anyone have similar problem?
