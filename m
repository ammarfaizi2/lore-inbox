On the face of it, the Ottawa Linux Symposium has some
explaining to do. This following quote is from:
http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2006/cfp.php

"Step 2 Committee Review"

"The programme committee will review your proposal per
 the guidelines above. Notification of acceptance or
 rejection will be sent by February 15th, 2006."

Luben, it looks like you failed at Step 2.5 (hidden):
political correctness. Perhaps OLS approved another
paper from a different author on a similar subject?

For reference here is the OLS review committee who, it
would seem, "approved" Luben's paper:
  Jeff Garzik, Red Hat Software
  Gerrit Huizenga, IBM
  Andrew Hutton, Steamballoon Incorporated
  Dave Jones, Red Hat Software
  Ben LaHaise, Intel Corporation
  Matt Mackall, Selenic Consulting
  Patrick Mochel, Intel Corporation
  Craig Ross, Linux Symposium
