Just out of a need to know things :)

What compiler do Alan Cox and Linus use to create the 2.4 series
kernels?

I am currently using RedHat's compiler gcc-2.96-85 and have been told
not to do so because it "breaks things" .

So far it has not broken anything, but then again i am compiling kernels
for use on my RedHat Distributions.

The question would be .. how hard is it going to be for me to upgrade to
gcc 3 +  and  will i get any benefit from it?  WillI loose any
advantages that i currently do have?

Or can i still get what i need from compiling 2.4.12 or 2.4.13 with the
compiler I have now?

Thank you 

Madhav Diwan
