Dear Friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because,
I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Moni Millat a merchant
in Iraq, in the war I have been dengerouslly wonded.

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have
only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.
 
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared
for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, 
I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused
on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just

wanting to have or make all the money in the world. 

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I 
would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that
 God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few 
close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided 
to give alms to charity 
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on
earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations
in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia.
 
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my 
accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity 
organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money
to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not 
to be contended with what I have left for them. 

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit 
of fourty million dollars $40,000,000,00 that I have with a 
finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect 
this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.
I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.Thank you for you 
understand .you can also reply to my private maill address
monimillat@gawab.com

God be with you. 

Moni Millat
