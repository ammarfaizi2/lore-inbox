        Hi all.  2.4.0-test11 is crashing during bootup while
detecting my raid5 array.  According to the EIP printed (assuming
I did it right), that's in the function xor_block().
        2.4.0-test10 works fine with the same .config.  One of the
things in the change file for test11 is "make raid 5 work in himem
configs".  Maybe that broke non himem configs?
        My .config is attached.  If anyone needs anymore information,
let me know.
