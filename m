I'd beg to differ with you on that. The way I've heard it is that writing
viruses is not legal in the US. Some of you aren't here so you have your
own laws but then you aren't bound by the DMCA. I recall that was the
impetus for this thread in the first place.

I'll just have to beg off and say that I've understood it that
'educational' are as illegal as say, something you meant to release into
the wide world.
