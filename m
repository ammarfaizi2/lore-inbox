Hello Everyone,

I have a crazy idea, it popped into my mind while reading one of the many short
History of Linux articles. I would like to document the complete history of
Linux. In my opinion it would be best to have everything: opinions, quotes,
original newsgroup postings. I have many ideas but would rather hear yours so
please email them to me. My email address is owen@1320web.com. Also it would be
greatly appreciated if you could forward this to your local LUGs, other mailing
lists and what not.

Thanks In Advance,
Owen Stampflee
