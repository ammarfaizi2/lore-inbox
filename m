Yep.  Same here.  Latest and greatest...

Your mail to 'linux-lvm' with the subject

    Re: [linux-lvm] *** ANNOUNCEMENT *** LVM 0.9.1 Beta 7 available at
www.sistina.com

Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.

Now, I held my breath until the following day...

Your request to the linux-lvm mailing list

    Posting of your message titled "Re: [linux-lvm] *** ANNOUNCEMENT
*** LVM 0.9.1 Beta 7 available at www.sistina.com"

has been rejected by the list moderator.  The moderator gave the
following reason for rejecting your request:

"Non-members are not allowed to post messages to this list."
---8<---

Since there is such a long delay between the two mails, it's obvious
that there is human intervention involved.  And when an on-topic mail
is rejected by the moderator, well... go figure.

And this isn't the first time this has happened to me and several
others.  By far...
