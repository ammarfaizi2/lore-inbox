Now we actually isolate a point on which perhaps we disagree.

If there are things which _need_ to be done, but which no individual
customer is willing to pay for in Free Software, one of the following
things will happen:

 1. They'll revert to proprietary software.
 2. They'll club together with other users of the software and fund it.
 3. The contractors (us) will 'tax' them enough on the stuff they _are_ 
	willing to pay for to do it in the background.

I see plenty of evidence that #2 and #3 are actually happening in real
life. I've also seen a lot of #1 of course, but I suspect its frequency
will be decreasing over the coming years.

I certainly wouldn't assert that #1 will die out altogether, but neither
will the non-existence of #2 and #3 cause the Free Software bubble to
burst.

That's possibly a better example than your previous one of GCC, but
without disrespect to your achievements I still suspect it would have
happened, and indeed will happen, eventually.
