saw it too with gdm on Gentoo, I tried to track it down but could not come up 
with a solution... I'm now back to rc2-mm4

what I saw was this:
I have a radeon 9000:
0000:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV250 If 
[Radeon 9000] (rev 01)
0000:01:00.1 Display controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon RV250 [Radeon 
9000] (Secondary) (rev 01)

with rc3-mm1 X is complaining that it cannot find a device section for 
PCI:1:0:1 even when I have created a device section for it...

I had another problem with rc3-mm4: during boot ntp-client runs but it fails 
saying that the service is incorrect and that the server cannot be found.

this is with the same .config as for rc2-mm4 (regenerated by `make oldconfig`)
