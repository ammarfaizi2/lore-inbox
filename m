Sorry for the distraction...

To celebrate the 10 years since Linus posted the first announcement
about his "hobby", svlug and sbay.org are hosting a Picnic/BBQ on
Saturday, Aug. 25th in Sunnyvale, CA, USA.

I'm posting because many of you may be in the Bay Area that weekend
for Linux World or IDC (both the following week) and we don't want you
to miss out.  Everyone is welcome to attend.  Their will be free food
and drinks* for everyone who RSVPs.

T-shirts are being sold to fund the event.  Email me at
drew@linux10.org if you'd like to purchase one.

(see:  http://linux10.org/images/frontshirt.jpg ).

If you are in the area that weekend, please rsvp as soon as possible
at:

http://linux10.org/rsvp/  

and if you need transportation, check out the ride-board at:

http://linux10.org/ride_board/

Any questions?  Please email me off-list at drew@linux10.org.

Hope to see some of you there,
