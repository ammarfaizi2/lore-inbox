Doesn't the copyright-holder of the work have the final decision wether or
not a non-GPL-modification may be inserted? I think the only change that
should be done then is a notice that this and that is non-GPL but permitted
by the copyright-holder...

Ofcourse, If you aren't the copyright-holder of the work (in his totality),
you need to contact the copyright-holder in order to receive (written)
permission...

Just a thought.
