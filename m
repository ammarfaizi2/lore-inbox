Is it possible for Linux to kill a Microsoft (or any) mouse via the USB 
port? I hadn't seriously considered that problem... I don't have the 
proper test equipment to check the voltages on the USBs to see if 
something is amiss.

And here I was going to write it off as "mouse suicide", the result of a 
Microsoft mouse becoming depressed because it was attached to a Linux 
system.

(Note: For real humor, I should post a story to Slashdot about how Linux 
kills Microsoft mice, with misleading anecdotes and undiscovered 
evidence. But, despite my somewhat off-kilter mood today, I will 
restrain myself.)
