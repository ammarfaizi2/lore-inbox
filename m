Hello,

are there any plans to wrap DCOM ability into the Linux kernel "someday"? 
Or will you wait until .net might be widely acepted and don't go into DCOM
anyhow? 

Like it or not, but you need DCOM if you want to connect to DCOM organized
networks, like OPC and others.

I know about the Sourceforge freedce project, but that is still hanging and
I expect more capabilities and user comfort if a stronger group of
developers will take care and implement DCOM directly into the kernel like
Windoze somehow does.

There is a commercial DCOM solution available by Software AG, but that's far
beyond any GPL, but heavily expensive!

(This is just a question to get an idea about your planning, no complaining
at all!). 

Thank You.
Siegfried Wessler
