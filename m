	Well yes, little typo, but the projcet is alive and well at:

http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/libnet/
"Libnet is a collection of routines to help with the construction and
handling of network packets. It provides a portable framework for
low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet
features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
functionality."

Download at: http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/dist/libnet.tar.gz

If you stil can't get it, mail me privately.
