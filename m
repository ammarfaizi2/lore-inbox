Hi again,



some old brain-cells got excited with the "good-ol-days" and other names have
surfaced like "Superbrain","Sirius" and "Apricot".Sirius was Victor in the
USA.  If you go done the so-called IBM compatible route then the nearly
compatible  nightmares  will arise and haunt you, your lucky if the scars
have faded!!

I learnt my computing on a PDP8/E with papertape punch/reader, RALF, Fortran
II, then later 2.4Mb removable cartridges (RK05 I think).  toggling in the
bootstrap improved your concentration. Much later you could
get a single chip(?) version of this in a wee knee sized box.

One summer job was working on a PDP15 analog computer alongside an 11/20 with
DECTAPE, trying to compute missile firing angles. [A simple version of Pres
Bush's starwars shield].
