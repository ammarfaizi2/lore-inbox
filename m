Jepp Lee your are right.

Well, the lawyers sometimes like cancer..nobody wants them nobody need 
them, but they still there. *hard ironic* Couldn't we tie all togehter, 
to make the world better? To make more hardware loving Linux? And peace 
on earth *ironic off - taken from Miss Hardware Support election live 
from Germany*

But omitting a costumer in some decisions could break there neck..

If we would have such company we would may do something like that, but 
hey..saying my Hardware is Linux friendly is much cooler :-)
And mh some goverments and schools using AMD and NForce Chipsets..this 
is a lost market..they are blind?
In my old school we had 200 + 100 computers with NForce2..and they 
wanted to move to Linux OS..but can't..sharing my knowledge stuck at the 
point of driver support from NVidia for Linux so the problem was on the 
root (hardware). Now they changed to Intel and what happen no NVidia 
anymore - isn't the worth would NVidia say right?

Greets & Best regards
Michael
