Well, I was sort of hoping there might be something better/easier than working 
on the binary driver (which btw is illegal.. oh well :).

Like I said I know very little about kernel hacking, this is really my first 
experience with it ever. I know simple wrapper C, I'm new at low level 
programming.

I have heard of IDA Pro, its a disassembler to COBOL, right?

If I go down the emulator idea, how do I do that?... could you give me a good 
starting point to continue from or link me to a good guide?...
