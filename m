The dmcrypt swap can only be unlocked by the user with a passphrase,
which is analogous to how you unlock your ssh private key stored
on the disk using a passphrase.

So I don't see the problem.

This version looks to me like a custom implementation of dmcrypt that
lives inside swsusp which ends up being either less secure than simply
using dmcrypt due to the lack of a passphrase, or it's going to involve
more hacks to get a passphrase from the user at resume time.
