	Hi.

	I've done some test on an production(!) machine, that runs Debian
Woody and 2.4.22. It's a dual PIII1.2Ghz, 6Gb RAM. It serves about 40
x-terminals, and some features of 2.6.0 will help us a lot.

	I've done a small kernel, only with one driver: network card. No
modules support, so I hope I wouldn't need to install any software on my
woody. In the end of mail is my .config

	I had strange problems with network support. My network config is:

[root@kama:~] # ifconfig -a

	This was got on 2.4.22, but seems equal to the output on 2.6.0.

	On the main network, 143.107.44.0/23 (eth0), I pingged only some
hosts. Very strange. Ping 143.107.45.56, 45.2, but no 143.107.45.12 45.37, that are
on the some network.
	I've found something strange on the arp table. The command
/usr/sbin/arp -a only show MACs from the eth1 network. The eth0 addresses that
I've pingged doesn't appear on the arp table. Everything is working fine with 2.4.22.

	I hope this report could be useful.

	My lspci out (2.4.22):
