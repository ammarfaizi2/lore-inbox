For nearly 10 years I've read many posts by RMS and the replies that
follow. RMS's posts seem calm, rational and clearly presented. For the
most part, the replies are emotional, high strung, and mean spirited
personal attacks.

Note that I'm not a card carrying member of the RMS fan club, nor do I
agree with everything he says.  I'm just an observer noting the striking 
difference in the tone between RMS's posts and the responses.
