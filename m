All too common.  You should begin by kindly pointing out what their
obligations are, and if they fail to comply, switch to a harsher tone,
and post your correspondence in a public place.  I'm not certain that
lkml is the proper place for this, but it may be the only place we
have.  If all else fails, slashdot them.  That will probably also
fail, but at least you can enjoy watching other people call them
names.

That's a bit ironic, considering that Debian are among those that take
the "freedom" thing most seriously.  Maybe you can get some ideas from
the debian-legal list.
