What's wrong with small business? Just because a model doesn't work for 
large companies doesn't invalidate the model. And I'm not convinced that 
the model fails on a larger scale.

My business is growing; I've doubled revenues in the last year, and am 
building alliances with other small shops to handle larger tasks. The 
key, for me at least, is creating a baseline product that provides a 
foundation on which I build applications for clients. I'm working on two 
more baselines at the moment, while building a coalition to tackle 
larger jobs.

I'm not interested in playing with "the big boys", nor do I have a 
desire to "put Microsoft out of business.".

I much prefer to play in the spaces that the big boys have no interest 
in. I can employ several people, have a very comfortable life, and work 
on projects that are far more interesting and important than replacing 
Microsoft. It is possible to build a quality life (and perhaps a 
society) from an economic model that is not founded on corporate 
megalomania.
