I have had no luck with ps/2 mouse on an Asus P5A-B mobo with newer
kernel versions, I have tried 2.4.12 and 2.4.13 with no luck. It works
fine with 2.2.19, though.

With 2.4.12 & 13 I get "Detected PS/2 Mouse Port." in dmesg only when
the mouse is not plugged in. Plug it in, no message of ps/2.

If anyone has any suggestions I would love to be able to use 2.4 kernel,
hopefully it is something stupid I have missed.
