Hi!

I'm afraid they have only one with intel RISC on board for hardware raid,
which amkes these card rather exensive for me wanting multilple channels,
nota higher quality of service.
It's like I do not want GB Ethernet, I only wanta single card with 4 Fast
Ethernet ports. Just for storage: a single ATA-4/5 host adapter PCI card
with as many channels as possible...
