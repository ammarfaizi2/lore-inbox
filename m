Hi there, guys.

I was wondering, has anyone out there made a port of
exec-shield-2.4.22-G4 for 2.4.22-rmap15k ? If so, is
it available anywhere?

I'm about to upgrade a couple of boxes, and I'd really
love to be able to use them together, but exec-shield
applied on top of rmap gives a couple of rejects I'm
not sure how to resolve by hand.

Thanks for any pointers you might have.


Regards,


//kj
