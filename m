Speaking for myself, I find the issue interesting, and this interest is not 
idle.

I would not take Larry's huffing and puffing as an indication of general 
sentiment.  He's pretty much going to have a kneejerk reaction in favor of 
fencing off the commons any time the issue comes up, that should be clear 
enough by now.

As for Larry's argumentation style, it is consists mostly of rhetoric and ad 
hominem attacks.  Considering that, I thought that you presented your points 
well and did not rise to take the flamebait overly quickly.

Advantage Karim.
