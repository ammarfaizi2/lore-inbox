>From Mr Alex Kargbo Alie

Dear SIR,

I am Mr. Alex Kargbo Alie and my sister is Miss Jan Kargbo Alie, we are the children of late Chief Kargbo Alie  from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of thirty  Million Dollars ($30,000.000.00) now
in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my father made them to under stand that the boxes
belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:

My late father Chief Kargbo Alie, a native of Kailahun District in the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his
family thats talking about my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with the CERTIFICATE OFDEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid of U.N evacuation team.

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries
were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my
uncle's involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year  . Now
my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees and orphans.

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the
Security Firm To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.

1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security
 Firm as our beneficiary

2. to transfer this money (USD$30M) in your name to your country
