Alejandro,

I too am reading this book and I can recommend the 3rd edition - it's 
very well written (maybe not as much as Robert Love's Kernel Development 
book though ;)). The O'Reilly site contains the book examples for the 
3rd edition so perhaps you could just download those examples and where 
the book refferences examples go to the new versions and look at the 
PDFs someone else mentioned if there's 2.6 specific things in there you 
don't understand.

But getting your hands on a 3rd edition book will be beneficial I'd say.

Anyway, back to reading that book for me!
