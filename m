	My point was that nowadays most manufacturers, as a matter of course, do not 
provide full details on how the hardware is programmed, and there appears to 
be no significant market for high-performance 3D graphics with an open 
specification.

	I do not like owning a space heater with nifty DVI outputs, and that is a 
fact I take into account when I make a purchasing decision for graphics cards 
I will be using with Linux.

	But I realize that ultimately, companies respond to markets, and not idealism 
and know that ACME Hardware will publish the specs for their rocket-shoes when 
the piece of the Linux rocket-shoe pie becomes lucrative enough. And because I 
do, I try to change the market and educate consumers -- not browbeat companies 
or turn the piece into a crumble by limiting what consumers can do.
