If there's a misunderstanding of the potential here, of the commercial
potential, or the user-demand for these patches (which now touch
absolutely no existing *.{c,S,h} files, then I'm willing to communicate
those things to whomever needs it.

This is not a toy.  The goal is not to continue modifying the kernel
or make anybody's life hard.  The contrary is true - I don't want
any modifications.  These are extremely simple patches to fix one
pair of broken instructions in PVI mode.

Coming from an x86 company, I'm betting Linus will get this
in a nano-second.  Let's not speak for him.
