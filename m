Actually, if it were so important it WOULD have been done. I suspect 
that the issue is not lack of a good solution, but lack of a good

including make the inodes seem to go away, so the count is "right" for 
what the user sees.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
