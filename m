Its not a "stealing" issue. Its about whether its worthwhile, dollar-wise, 
to finance innovation. With free source, its not, because you have to give 
away  your investment and then anyone can use it equally. Secondly, the 
"open-source" community openly shuns binary distributions (A. Cox never 
misses an opportunity), so there is no avenue for commercial innovation 
that is "worthwhile".
