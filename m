Hey everyone, I was thinking about it, and I'll bet you guys are getting 
quite a few bug reports on 2.6.x, and hardly any compliments in comparison.

Just for the crap of it, I'm emailing in to say that I migrated from 
2.4.23 to 2.6.1 last night, and, while it wasn't the smoothest 
transition ever, I succeeded, and 2.6.1 has made my desktop speedier 
then when running any windows or previous version of linux.

Great job folks - another excellent chapter in the linux saga. :-P

(The ehci-hcd module still locks the kernel immediately tho.) :(
