Sally new draft:
ftp://ftp.normos.org/ietf/internet-drafts/draft-floyd-tcp-reset-00.txt

builds a strong case against the RST issue and maybe used to point

But you are right, it will be stronger and wiser to wait until this is
standardized before paying a visit to the site owners.
Any one wishing to volunteer, please still send your emails in --
we should be ready in a few days from now,
