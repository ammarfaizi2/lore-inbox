Dear Friend,
Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad 
necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing 
the sum of USD41,000.000 forty one million  dollars)inherited from my 
father's business reserve.
I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. 
He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was 
victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was 
assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding 
the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the 
insecurity of both our lives and property then decided to deposit the 
above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money 
has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was 
burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's 
loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to 
offer 15% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds 
overseas or 25% share for possible help on investing in any reliable 
venture.
there are however some minimal cost involved in securing the release of 
this deposit from the present holding company.i do not intend to 
overburden you with these cost.but you must know beforehand that we will be 
sharing whatever cost involved in retrieving this deposit and putting it 
to beneficial use.
if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for 
detailed information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat 
with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone 
and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly 
appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
patkice luco.
