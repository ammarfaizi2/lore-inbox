Greetings;

A question and a comment.

Q: Where have the 'nv' drivers gone in the make xconfig display? 
I just bought a Chaintech Gforce 5200 and cannot find the driver
in the menu so I can make the module.

Comment: While apparently stable, it appears that its slowing
down the stuff that normally runs at a nice=19, such as
setiathome.  This box normally does about 7.5 units a day, and
has only been doing about 5 to 6 the last few days.

-- 
Cheers, Gene
