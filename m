As much as SCO disturbs me, these kinds of underhanded attacks against 
them disgust me.  They stoop to SCO's level, or worse.  SCO can and will 
be dealt with properly through the use of FACTS.

Besides, DoS attacks against SCO will only be blamed on the Linux 
community.  So the developer of that virus is either a complete idiot or 
is acting to intentionally hurt our image.
