Hmm, I've one such troll announcing into my inbox, sending stuff like
below. I hope he's the only one.

So stop spreading nonsense about "NO COMPROMISES" and
stop comparing
me to Mickey$oft. Thanks.

---------------------

Such a CUNT!!! Microsoft do very well engineered
software, something Linux can't sadly achive in ages
if still emply LOOSERS LIKE U.

When a Microsoft engineer see a people like u, simply
laugh!!!

U MORON. U ARE SUCH A STUPID CUNT, NOW ALL THE LIST
KNOW ABOUT U, WE ALL LAUGHT!

If swsusp1 panics system, that's a bug. I'm not
accepting that one.

Refusing to suspend (I'd call it "fail to suspend") is
bad but is not
a bug. Do we understand each other now?

U know, I used to call u your name this days: STUPID,
IDIOT, MORON, but that's not enough.

Your last sentence related with your CRAPPY, LURID,
DANGEROUS swsusp1 qualify u as what u are.

A WORST GEEK, A LOOSER, A STUPID CUNT: U WONT EVER
ADMIT YOUR PROGRAM CRASH AND THAT IS A BUG :-((((
