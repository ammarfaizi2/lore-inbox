Are you sure?  Based on reading the GNU page the stance seems to be that the
"OS" should be called GNU/Linux.  I don't see anything that says the kernel
should be renamed, only that when referring to the system as a whole it
would be better to be called GNU/Linux.  That's what makes this discussion
offtopic, it's not the kernel's name that GNU is complaining about and this
is the kernel list.

Later,
Tom
