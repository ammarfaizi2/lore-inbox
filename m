Okay, once more, same question. Mail above says that "You

etc.". Probably not me. But lets say Halle Berry. Is she allowed to
create CVS2ARCH tool?

The mail above seems to suggest she is... Is my impression right? "Is
Halle Berry allowed to write CVS2ARCH tool, using documented
interfaces, with free version of bitkeeper?"
