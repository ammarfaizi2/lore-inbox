Indeed. It may even be an idea to take what I started doing at
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/Linux-2.5.html, merging the two
and Guillaume running with this if you have time, because these days,
between hacking and merging patches, I'm kept pretty busy, so updates
to that file are getting less frequent.
