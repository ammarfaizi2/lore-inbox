People sometimes ignore your messages repeatedly, right? 
And Linus is _human too_. Why _demand_ him to answer?

But we can _ask nicely_. :-) I'd put it this way:

Hi Linus!

I want to inform you that lots of folks here
would like to know what do you think about kbuild25:
* "I'll merge it soon"  or
* "I'll merge it later, not now"  or
* "I won't merge it because ....."  or
* other?
