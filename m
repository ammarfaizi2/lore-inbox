	Seem that the runix.ro is dead for good, but the beauty of GPL is that
we still a FAST mirror:

ftp://web1.redwave.net/pub/mips/

with the most important pieces, and that was mirrored after:

 http://www.stampede.org/~lethal/mips/
 ( the binary stuff is in ./notdocs but there are also a lot of MIPS
interesing things)

not to mention that there is a live site at:

http://playstation2-linux.com/

where you can meet people with same interests.

P.S. On ftp://web1.redwave.net/pub/ there is also a mirror for Linux
Mandrake for all arch and hopefully soon a mirror for kernel !!!
