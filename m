For how long did you run the test?

It is known that often a 24-hour memtest is not enough to find real world
memory failures.

Also it is known that gcc (yeah you`ll wonder) is much better at finding them,
so there`s the question: do you compile stuff often, and if so, whether
gcc bails out with "internal error" messages sometimes?

Also, if i were you i would do the following:

bash-2.05b$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=test bs=1048576 count=1024
bash-2.05b$ bzip2 test
bash-2.05b$ bunzip2 test.bz2

And if you have a memory failure bzip2 checksumming would show that up on the
bunzip2 stage.
