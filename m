Oh, they too.  They too.  My first sentence was wrong, I'm just
trying to say that increasingly harder punishment against
_dead easy_ crime won't work.  And that people actually are
responsible for taking simple precautions.

I am not that extreme.  But if someone leaves their car with the engine
running all day they are stupid and shouldn't be surprised when
it is stolen.
Someone who leave a unattended company car with the engine running 
deserve to get fired when it is stolen.  This is neglect.

Of course the thief is a criminal too, and the worst one.  But
not taking any precautions is neglecting responsibility.

You can run your internet server on windows.  Nothing inherently
wrong in that.  But then you'd better put a good firewall in front 
of it.  And you'll run the latest virus checkers.  And you'll
turn _off_ particularly unsafe "features".  Windows servers can
be safe, but many aren't.

Not doing this is like storing your money in a heap on the street.
A thief taking your pile is still a thief but there is less
punishment because he didn't break in or threaten anybody.
