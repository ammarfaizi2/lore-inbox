Subject: [GIT PATCH] Remove devfs from 2.6.15 - try 2
Message-ID: <20060113194551.GA18262@kroah.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0

Ok, it's been a week and a half, and I have not heard a single peep out
of anyone about the email titled "Subject: devfs going away, last chance
to complain"

So here's the patches again, updated to your latest git tree.

They are the same "delete devfs" patches that I submitted for 2.6.12 and
2.6.13 and 2.6.14.  It rips out all of devfs from the kernel and ends up
saving a lot of space.  Since 2.6.13 came out, I have seen no complaints
about the fact that devfs was not able to be enabled anymore, and in
fact, a lot of different subsystems have already been deleting devfs
support for a while now, with apparently no complaints (due to the lack
of users.)

Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/devfs-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/devfs-2.6.git/

I've posted all of these patches before, but if people really want to look at them, they can be found at:
	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-05-devfs/

Also, if people _really_ are in love with the idea of an in-kernel
devfs, I have posted a patch that does this in about 300 lines of code,
called ndevfs.  It is available in the archives if anyone wants to use
that instead (it is quite easy to maintain that patch outside of the
kernel tree, due to it only needing 3 hooks into the main kernel tree.)

thanks,

greg k-h
