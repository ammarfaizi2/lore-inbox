The machine that is being built is an old AST Advantage with a pentium
75 chip.
I realize that this is an ``Ancient'' machine, but I'm using it for a
dmz machine behind my firewall.  

I used the same .config file for each instance of the kernel compile
with the following:

gzip -cd patch-2.4.?.gz | patch -p0
cd linux
make mrproper
cp ../AST.config .config
make xconfig
make dep
make bzImage

copy kernel to the old box via scp
copy System.map to the old box
reboot the old box and see what happens

Here is the .config file:

This configuration works with 2.4.4, but later versions it hangs as

1.1.3 kernel :-)

Any help would be greatly appreciated
