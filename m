Capture and dual head are almost totally unsupported without using a
proprietary, binary only driver chunk which will soundly place your system as
'unsupported' as far as this list is concerned due to the difficulty of
debugging a system when sourceless software bangs the hardware.

If this situation is not ideals for you, I suggest you address the issue
with Matrox. 

That said, it is a dandy general 2d/3d card.
