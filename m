Such a control element doesn't have to be IFACE_MIXER if you want to
hide.  You can use IFACE_CARD, for example, for a card-specific
element but not belonging to the mixer component.

That's true.  OTOH, invoking a command at each time isn't always a
good solution, depending on the event-frequency and heaviness.
