I agree, but the terms of use of their licensed or re-licensed product can
be revoked, and their product may be the enitre kit.  Pieces are parts, 
the sum is the whole, and where this rime is going ... blah blah ...

Their customers may be bound to some contract law we have never seen.
The more interesting part is looking into the money trail of who is the
financial backing and how much was contributed.  This is where I stop.

Naming names will get somebody toasting warm and I like it cool and quiet
now.
