Cleaning windows can be a hassle - getting them streak-free and perfectly clean can be 
almost impossible without the right cleaner.

If you would like to receive more information about how to make your automotive and home
glass and mirrors so clean they become almost invisible, please REPLY to this email and
enter "glass cleaner" in the SUBJECT line - make sure it's the SUBJECT line otherwise our
system will not recognize your request!

If you are not interested in these products please accept our apologies for this intrusion. To stop
