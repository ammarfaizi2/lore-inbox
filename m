mmhh, java will not be death untill a lot of commecial software will use
it for graphical interfaces.
Infact it is simpler and cheaper for them to use java, and so we have to
deal with this bad future, where a dead language will be keept alive by

That said, should we care about this? In my opinion, NO. and why we
should? when there are no good technical reasons, political reasons should
please disappear.
