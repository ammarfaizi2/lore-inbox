That tool is called copyright.  The author releases the work
and in exchange for that a TEMPORARY government protected
monopoly on commercial replication of that work is granted.

The main problem nowadays seems to be that:

1) the "temporary" has been extended by politicians into
   an effectively infinite time

2) the copyright holder has much more rights than those
   granted by copyright legislation (due to eg. DMCA and
   a on of other bought laws)

3) the work could be binary, it would be nice if the source
   code would also have to be released into the public domain
   after the copyright has expired
