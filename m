There are different levels of evil. I never heard Nvidia complaining about

You can _USE_ Linux without being a kernel developer. You talk about _YOUR_ 
business problems and not about problems related to this community.

So why are you complaining ? You have done this for 7 years, do it for another 
7. The Linux community is not responsible for _YOUR_ problems with SUSE or 
complain at the appropriate SUSE mailing list.

Stop trolling!
