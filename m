Also, one may wish to invest in the purchase of 'How to Lie with
Statistics'[1] by Darrel Huff (ISBN 0-393-31072-8). An easy yet
powerful little read.

[1] this is not meant to imply that anyone here is lieing, attempting to
lie, thinking of lieing, wishing they were lieing or having anything to
do with lieing, purposeful or otherwise.
