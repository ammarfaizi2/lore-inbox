	At our office, we actually had a sysadmin suggest that the reason
we had problems with viruses propagating was because they couldn't put
everyone on Exchange (some of us use Unix/Linux) and that was causing the
problems.  Of course...  Operating systems which are immune to these things
are to blame for the epidemics on the ones that are suceptible.  That
makes sense.  Grrrr....  Of course the availablity of quality drivers with
sources are the reason for crappy closed source drivers...  I can see his
reasoning (isn't that scary).  <;-/=/

	Actually, it does make a perverted sort of sense.  If we didn't
have systems that didn't have these problems, nobody would think that
there was anything wrong.  They would just think that "of course, this
is what you expect from suppliers".  They would have no yardstick to
measure against, so rebooting a computer once a day or having a blue
screen would just be part of the normal experience.  So we DO contribute
to his problems!  We provide a standard which he can not live up to or
even pursue given the manpower and talent he may have (or not have).
How is he suppose to innovate when the Open Source community is setting
such a high standard for him?  :->=>

	Well...  Yeah...  Of course, Andre.  Can you see how that stiffles
his innovation.
