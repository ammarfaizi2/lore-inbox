I may be missing the point here, (In case you're more than welcome to
correct me), but ... Why? Can't a software license restrict the usage
of the software? In which ways do you think the sentence "Don't use in
DRM'ed hardware" differs from sentences like  "Not allowed in country
X",  "Don't use for commercial purposes",  and other alikes ? I think
that saying in which hardware your software can or cannot run is a
pretty valid license term (without messing with the question about it
being the right thing to do here).

Besides that, I pretty much agree with the rest of your mail.
