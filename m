No, that is a legal requirement, not a weakness due to molding, but I get your 
point.

BTW, to my mind, the killer app in a business environment is the automatic 
file versioning feature in longhorn.  This protects people against fat finger 
mistakes, and geez, any business has its fair share of fat head, fat finger 
and dumb blond types.  This is the only feature from VMS that I am longing 
for...
