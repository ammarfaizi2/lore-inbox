Last time I've seen it invoked was probably a couple of weeks ago.

ISTR that you had an entry on AFW - it would more or less fit there.

Stuff generating random quotes (aka. sigmonsters) is pretty common,
indeed, but fitting said quotes into McQ is a part of fun. I suspect
that strong dislike to excessive sigs goes back to the beginning of
Endless September - like it or not, "why would I give a fuck for
conventions" attitude correlates with particulary obnoxious breed
of lusers. Same as with HTML postings, or quoted-printable crap.

Seeing that from folks who should know better... Ugh.

And no, I really don't care for the contents - if anything, I find
both sides of holy war around g*n* c**t**l moderately amusing, but
for all I care it could be 6-7 lines of PARRY vs. ELIZA dialog (or
vi macros, or just a line noise).

BTW, there's one more jarring thing about use of sigs on l-k - you are
getting _two_ sigs that way (look at the unsubscribe instructions).
