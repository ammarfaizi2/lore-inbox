Sorry, prior art exists. When iomega (the ZIP people) first shipped, they
brought out a unit to demo. They pulled the media out, tossed it against
the far wall, kicked it back, wiped it and ran from it. Then lifted the
front of the case about two inches and dropped it. 

In those days the "hard drives" were the same size, 10MB (sic), and the
heads would crash if a mouse farted in the next room. Bought a bunch, and
had very few problems.

I would be inclined to allow this for Windows drives instead. They contain
no useful data.
