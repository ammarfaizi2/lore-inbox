I have been doing some research on running 2 independent displays off of 1 
machine (ie 2 keyboards, 2 mice, 2 vid cards, 2 monitors).. there are some 
hacks out there now that "sort of" work.... but nothing stable and official.. 
it's all hacks....   I have read that support for this is planned for 
2.5/2.6, and would like to know what progress has been done.  I am willing to 
help where I can.  I am a good C/C++ programmer, but have not done any kernel 
work so far.
