please send me your modified version again. full file would be best, not 
patch.

i can't reproduce any problems here, so far, so i'm stabbing in the 
dark. if you can give more detailed information to reproduce, that would 
be nice: hardware versions, version of KDE, kde settings, (mine doesn't 
play a startup sound and artsd works fine for everything else i try), 
artsd settings. if i can reproduce, i can analyze on my own machine, if 
not, outlook is hazy ;-)
