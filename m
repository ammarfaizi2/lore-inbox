Hello ,

I had done a 2.4.16 kernel related compilation
and used it. When i did "init 0" for the first time
and then again tried get a GNU/Linux system related to 2.4.16
it might have showed related to severe filesystem corruption
problems.And at one time related to that atleast i  could not even
use GNU/Linux.It had atleast a i810  chipset and a Pentium
Processor.


I have in my     house 2 machines which is not i810 and i
did not find any problems related to  typical filesystem corruption.


May be a typical bug related to filesystem corruption
is not completely fixed in 2.4.16.
