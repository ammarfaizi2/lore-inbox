Would it not be simple and effective to filter out mail produced by
Outlook?
It sounds to me the equivalent of RBL & co.
RBL filter out mail from open relay used to spam us.
NoOutlook filter out mail from poor software/OS used to propagate viruses.

I guess that 100% of incomming viruses in lkml come from a Outlook mailer.
And for the last two ones I'm sure.
