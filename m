Not posible. You can't firewall all the mail ; and you can't delete
it after (There's always someone reading a post sec after it's sent to people)

Better thread organization is indeed something good. Linux has like
·&$%=%)=& differents mailing lists. It'd be much nicer to have
kernel-sound@domain.com, kernel-smp@domain.com...
A project could ask a mailing list (even space for web and patches;
if someone plans to support it). Just because one can imagine a
kernel-sound@domain.com list. But whatever the alsa mailing list is;
it's harder to remember. You can forward kernel-sound@domain.com to 
the true malinign list if you want.

Mixing always 2.4 and 2.5 stuff it isn't a good idea either

The everything-in-linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org just doesn't work as well as
one would want. Yes, you've [RFC], [PATCHES], [BENCHMARK] to filter.
But what the hell is the [RFC] mail about? net? vm?

*nobody* reads all the mails (well, there's Alan Cox, but he isn't human)
Some good posts indeed are lost between the noise. We have marc.theaimsgroup.com.
But do you really think it's enought? BK has given us some degree of
organization (you can search who and when touched something, what files were 
touched in the patch, etc). The bugzilla database tries to give us
some degree of organization in the bugs field, just because the 
all-in-linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org approach is a *true hell* in that sense.

What we need to address that? Resources. No, that's not the first thing. We need
that people think that we need it, and we need that people *wants* it. 

After that we need resources: Which is a difficult point. But it's more
important that some of the nice features that have been merged in 2.5 IMHO
(as it's a long-term benefit)
