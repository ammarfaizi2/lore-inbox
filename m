They are bad if it's hardware-related. The big one is manufactured in Hungary, 
the other one in Thaiwan.

The error occured again.

I post the new errors. Maybe you can see any structure in it.

Sep 15 16:16:23 adlib kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,5)): 
ext2_free_blocks: bit already cleared for block (5412-5427)

e2fsck reported the following on that device (hda5):

Only syslog related files are concerned.

syslog is configured that it will accept logs from other machines. Maybe there's 
a possibility that these strange errors were caused by the network-card or 
-driver ? I own an eepro100. Just a thought...

These errors occured since 2.4.5 that's why I think it's software-related.

I'll try to use 'hdparm -d1 -X33 /dev/hda' and other modes to see if it occurs 
again. But testing could take some time. It appears ~~ every second day.
