for kernel device == major. It is assumed that complete major is handled by 
single driver. In exception cases when there are different drivers either you 
have one acting like dispatcher (input case) or one that simply requests more 
specific driver (misc case). But again, mousedev is using range of minors and 
there is currently no established way to construct aliases for that. Short of 
defining

alias char-major-13-32 mousedev
alias char-major-13-33 mousedev
...
alias char-major-13-63 mousedev

looks rather weird.

yes with the caveats above.

that is what coldplug is for. Hotplug comes with initscript that (if enabled) 
looks for devices already connected and emulates "connect" event for them. I 
use it between other things to load mousedev for PS/2 mouse that is always 
connected ... but I am running 2.6 in the first place (it won't work on 2.4) 
and modified hotplug package that supports input handlers. So when it finds 
any driver for input devices it automatically loads input handler for events 
generated by those devices.

of course not. It works differently. When you plug in USB mouse (or when 
hotplug initscript emulates plugging in USB mouse) hotplug calls USB agent. 
USB agent checks USB device ID and finds which modules to load. It is 
possible that it finds several modules. One of them is hardcoded - it is 
mousedev. Another one is hid that declares itself as driver for USB mouse. 
That simple.

yes you should build it in. Or ensure it is loaded together with hid.
