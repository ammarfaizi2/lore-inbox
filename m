Because cdrecord (and recently -prodvd) work. And they are "somewhat free".
There are not much dvd-dl writing programs around that do it without crashing
freezing or foobaring the disc. You are right, I could go to Nero or Nero4Linux
("the best of burning from Windows now for Linux"), but I don't.

The last time I checked, prodvd was free for non-commercial purposes and - as
far as I can *guess* - is free for commercial purposes as long as they give
notice that it is being used. Unless commercials disguise using the
non-commercial key.
