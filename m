And that's the only working way - the programming languages can actually
do it because it defines the syntax and semantics of the contents
anyways.
With this marker you are interferign with (at least) *all* text files.
And thus with *all* tools which "handle" those text files.

And there are always tools out there which simply do not understand the
generic marker and can not ignore it since these bytes are part of the
file. And thus tools (and people) will kill those markers (for whatever
reason and if it's simple ignorance) anyway.

Or another example: (Try to) start a perl/shell/... script (without
paranmeter on the first line) which was edited on Win* and binary copied
to a Unix system. Or at least guess what will happen ....
