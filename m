> Both 2.4.8 and 2.4.9 have this problem (these are the ones I tried).

  just to clarify: does 2.4.7 hangs?
  (for me it doesnt, but everything >= 2.4.8 does)

  also as i already said, the sound isn`t clear:
  there are little clicks here and there...

  but i have an infinite trace(*). you - don`t.

  (*) - in fact there are 3 traces.
    first - quite short (1-1.5 screen)
    second - 3-4 screens, and
    third - infinite...
