Subject: Kernel 2.6.10 Can't Open Initial Console on FC3

The newly compiled kernel gets through everything OK including mounting the root file system as read-only EXT3.  However, it freezes on the very last line, which says:

     Warning: unable to open an initial console

If I switch back over to the kernel that came with the distribution, everything boots fine, so I'm assuming the problem lies in the way I configured the kernel.

I ran "find / -name genromfs" which found nothing.

I feel like an idiot for posting this.  I'm probably missing something obvious.

I have:
* Pentium 3
* 256 MB RAM
* PCI ATI Rage 128 Graphics Card
* PS/2 Mouse
* PS/2 Keyboard
* Fedora Core 3

Thanks in advance.

# inittab       This file describes how the INIT process should set up
#               the system in a certain run-level.
#
# Author:       Miquel van Smoorenburg, <miquels@drinkel.nl.mugnet.org>
#               Modified for RHS Linux by Marc Ewing and Donnie Barnes
#

# Default runlevel. The runlevels used by RHS are:
#   0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#   1 - Single user mode
#   2 - Multiuser, without NFS (The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
#   3 - Full multiuser mode
#   4 - unused
#   5 - X11
#   6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
