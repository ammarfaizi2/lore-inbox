Hiszonyi,
That's a bit of hardware.  It's also a mechanicalmoving part.   It's the
type of thing that everyone would like to eliminate.  The lack of a fan
on an Apple iMac is one of its attractions.

Going back to your system  you could fit additional redundant fans.   The
failure of a processor fan is in my opinion unlikely to be a fire hazard
although running the chip at an elevated temperature could shorten its life.
If your system has a chip temperature sensor, then monitor use that.   If your
environment is dusty I would be more concerned about the power supply fan as
the mains voltages in there can cause arcing and therefore the dust could
ignite.

When you posted your initial message I thought you were thinking of software.
Windows products are I believe full of bugs basically because the source is
not available for scrutiny.
