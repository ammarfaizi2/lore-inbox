Greetings;

I just booted to a 2.6.6-mm2 kernel, and discoverd I had no sound.  So 
I logged back out of x, and found I had no keyboard!  ssh'd in from 
the firewall and rebooted it.

Both sound, and the backswitch from x were working perfectly up to and 
including 2.6.6.

1400 mhz Athlon, half a gig of memory, FC1 all yum updates.

Ideas?

Cheers, Gene
