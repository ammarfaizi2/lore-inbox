I wondered about that too.  From Documentation/cris:

What is CRIS ?
-------------- 
CRIS is an acronym for 'Code Reduced Instruction Set'. It is the CPU 
architecture in Axis Communication AB's range of embeddedn etwork 
CPU's, called ETRAX. The latest CPU is called

ETRAX 100LX, where LX stands for 'Linux' because the chip was designed 
to be a good host for the Linux operating system. 

Interesting, huh?
