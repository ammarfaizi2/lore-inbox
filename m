It's been a while since I've tried an -ac kernel...

On my Dell I8000, when running 2.48-ac5 pulling the AC plug out (or
plugging it back) causes the box to hang for a while prior to shutting
itself off.

I first reported this in 2.4.5-ac13 but didn't have the time to poke
around.

This does not happen with the Linus tree.

Does anybody have any ideas about things to try?

Attached is my config.
