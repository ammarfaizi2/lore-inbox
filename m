Hi,

you use a lot of words for saying something self contradictory. It's
very simple; based on your mail, there's no reason the VMI gateway page
can't be (also) GPL licensed (you're more than free obviously to dual,
tripple or quadruple license it). Once your gateway thing is gpl
licensed, your entire proposal is moot in the sense that there is no
issue on the license front. See: it can be very easy. Much easier than
trying to get a license exception (which is very unlikely you'll get)...


Now you can argue for hours about if such an interface is desirable or
not, but I didn't think your email was about that.

Greetings,
    Arjan van de Ven
