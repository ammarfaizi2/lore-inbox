I have never been in any doubt as to the specific claims I have
made. I continually have been talking about hard realtime from
start to finish, and it appears that everyone now agrees with me
that for hard-RT, a nanokernel solution is better or at least
not obviously worse at this stage.

Ingo actually of course has been completely rational and honest
the whole time - he actually emailed me to basically say "there
will be pros and cons of both, and until things develop further
I'm not completely sure".

Which I was pretty satisfied with. Then along came the lynch mob.
