You *chose* GNU/Linux to parallel Unix? I assume you mean that you
influenced GNU into using a Unix base with the eventual goal of having
some sort of GNU Unix base (the Hurd?). The words you selected above

Development costs resources. GNU has benefitted substantially from
resources offered for free by people that have other (usually non-GPL
or non-open source) means of putting food on the table. Respect this.
