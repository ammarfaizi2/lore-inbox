SAP is doing exactly what Scott is doing on a little larger base. They
have a product with a bazillion of levers and controls and they sell
you services to adapt their product on your needs. Things you could do
yourself if you have five years' time to read all the manuals.

So your argument simply doesn't hold. SAP is not exactly a "small
custom shop".
