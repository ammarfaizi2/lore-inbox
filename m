lease.openlogging.org is unreachable today.

So I guess I need to set up a cron job to renew my lease every
minute/hour/day/whatever so I can actually download new kernel
releases when they come out?  I can't even examine the code I
downloaded yesterday without that lease...  Now that's what I call
having my source code held hostage!
