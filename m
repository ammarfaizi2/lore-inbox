Subject: userland starvation with 2.4.25-rc2

I have this machine with 8GB main memory, two CPUs, two internal IDE
disks (on AMD 8111), and two external SCSI disks (on AIC79xx).  The
kernel is 2.4.25-rc2 built for ia32, with no aditional patches.  The
filesystem on the IDE disk is ext2 and the file system on the SCSI disks
is XFS.  I am trying to load the SCSI disk by doing in parallel:

1) bonnie++ -f
2) find /scsivol -type f | xargs cat > /dev/null
3) untar millions of files from tarball on IDE disk to SCSI disk
4) copy postgresql databases (data, xlogs on SCSI) using pg_dump | psql

The odd behavior I am observing is that userland can be virtually
starved for minutes at a stretch.  I have plotted the I/O and CPU load
time series here, if you care to see it graphically:

http://saturn5.com/~jwb/prime-starve.png

The upper graph is the CPU load, the lower graph is the I/O load.  As
you can see, at certain points the kernel will take all available CPU,
and I/O will slow to nearly a halt.  The longest period seen in this
graph is 140 seconds, during which certain interactive user processes
made progress (iostat -k 10, watch df -ha) while others did not (top,
watch "dmesg | tail").  Obviously very little of the I/O made progress.

I wonder if there is a /proc tweak I can make to avoid this behavior?
