The status of a central bug tracking database is not a
measure of Linux's maturity.  It is a measure of the
(perceived) maturity of acceptable bug tracking databases.

There are two ways to have developers use a bug-tracking
system.  Have an authority with power over them compel
them or make the database so useful to them that they have
to be fools not to use it.  Since unlike proprietary
development there is no such authority we will have to wait
until a database becomes sufficiently useful.

Sorry, but i get tired of people claiming Linux (or some
other project) isn't sufficiently mature because one aspect
didn't work as they would have liked.
