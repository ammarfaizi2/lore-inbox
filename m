 Hi Linus,

 I must commend you on the timing of your decision to step down
 as "Benevolent Dictator(TM)."  However I'm extremely disappointed
 by your nominations for your successor.  I think the time for 
 *benevolence* is over.  If we are to usher in a new era of Linux
 kernel development we must consider a broader, darker range of
 candidates.

 I'd like to nominate Senator Hollings!  He's the obvious choice
 since he clearly intends to usurp the role of Grand Software 
 Source Code Dictator for *all* software and firmware (open or closed).
 Indeed, regardless of whether you select him and even if he declines
 the title I think that we should all immediately add him to our MUAs 
 for automatic copies of all source code submissions, patches and 
 related discussions (for his legislative approval, of course).  
 (Of course we should also appoint a special "technical advisor" to 
 assist the Respected Mr. Hollings, William Gates III should be 
 considered; surely chairman Bill could see "the way out" of any
 conundrum offered by the development community).
