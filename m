A long time ago someone announced an application that looped through every
combination of RWX on memory protection 10 times to test architectures
against each other. Even after extensive googling I can't find this
application. Anyone who remembers where it may be located? It wouldn't be
too hard to make a new one if I can't find it.

Thanks
