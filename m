Subject: 2.6.0-test4 parallel seek & read problem

Hello everyone!

I have run into some strange behavior with kernel 2.6.0-test4.

I'm doing a lot of parallel random seeks and reads in a 128 Gigabyte
file. The file is located on a JFS partition on a 3ware Storage
Controller containing four IDE disks with an average seek time of
8.5 ms. The 3ware controller is configured as RAID0 with stripe size 1MB.

The operating system is Debian GNU/Linux, version testing.

Running on this system is a program listening for connections.  When a
connection is accepted, a thread is created. This thread will get a
free file descriptor from a pool of already opened file desriptors.
The thread will do a random seek on the fd, and a small read, around 3 Kb.
This data is then sent to the client and the connection is closed.

My program is linked agains libpthread.a from the libc6-dev package,
version 2.3.1-16, in Debian.

If I'm running kernel 2.4.21 or 2.4.22, I can connect to the program
500 times per second.  Using iostat-4.1.5 to monitor the system I see
500 reads/second issued to the disk.  So far so fine.

If I change to 2.6.0-test4 I can only connect to the program around 75
times per second.  During this time iostat reports around 120
reads/second issued to the disk.

If I change the elevator to 'deadline' or 'noop' I can connect to the
program around 300 times/second.  Iostat reports around 520
reads/second issued to the disk.

I also have a modified version of my program using nonblocking network
code, and aio.  This time I'm using the same fd for all aio
requests. The file is opened with the flag O_DIRECT, bypassing the
buffer cache. This time I'm able to reach close to 500 requests/second.

2.6.0-test1-ac3, and 2.6.0-test3-mm1 are behaving the same as 2.6.0-test4.

Someone have any idea what is going on?  Seems like something is not
what it should be.  My hope is to be able to reach the same amounts of
connections/second as with the 2.4 kernels.

I can't provide the source to the program, because it is owned by
someone else, but I hope someone can point me in the right direction
for further investigation of this problem.

Below are the output of dmesg and the kernel config file for 2.6.0-test4.

Best regards

/Magnus
