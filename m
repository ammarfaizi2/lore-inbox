Achim-

Uh, what exactly do you think you have here?  The I860 was a
completely new architecture that Intel dropped over 5 years
ago.  I've got one running Unix SVR4 in my basement but you
can't buy an I860 motherboard today.

(For the record the 860 was a great architecture for the time
and I'm still bitter that Intel dropped it but that's a different
story.)
