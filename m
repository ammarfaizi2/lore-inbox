Please do not force users to report X times the same bug in different place=
s.=20

This will only lead to lost information since people won't drag the whole=20
problem history each time. OTOH at least the initial stage of bug submissio=
ns=20
should be cc'd to the relevant lists, so that interested people can get on =
the=20
problems. This is what apache does (with big fat warnings to not reply to t=
he=20
mail but fire bugzilla instead) and it seems to work well.

Regards,
