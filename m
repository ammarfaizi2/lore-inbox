Hi CaT.

Show me where? The person I originally replied to was implying that we
should ignore people with more than one CD drive, and in reply I said
that such was not acceptable.

My situation lets me fall into BOTH camps of this argument:

 1. At home, I have both a DVD drive and a CD-RW in my main computer,
    and the other computers are all connected to it over a network.

 2. For me, "At work" means in my customer's premises, and I often
    find myself having to sort out scrambled Linux systems on just
    about any hardware combination you care to name.

In the latter category, I've gone all the way from demangling a 386sx/25
with 6M of RAM running Red Hat 4.2 and supposedly set up as a network
print server to demangling a quad P4 with 1G of RAM basically running
Red Hat 7.0 and acting as a stand-alone CAD workstation.

Precicely my point in making the original post.

Precicely.

My main reason for using Linux is simply that it's stable on just about
any hardware I throw it at, but the points you make aren't far behind.

Best wishes from Riley.
