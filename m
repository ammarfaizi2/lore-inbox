for crying out loud, earlier this week we had a post from some of the
network maintainers chastising someone becouse they only sent the patch to
the kernel list and not to the network list becouse many of the developers
don't read the kernel list.

if core kernel developers are telling people they don't read L-K then a
new person sending in a patch and not reading L-K all the time is very
reasonable. you can't have it both ways.

as for the -ac being the most important secondary tree, that's a matter of
opinion, in many cases it is, but in many cases a lot of stuff shows up in
it that never will make it to the main tree as well.
