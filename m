I can compile ac-5 fine but when trying to boot I get the following
error:

kernel BUG at ide-cd.c:790!
invalid operand: 0000

I am running 2.4.19pre3 without a problem.  I didn't have a way (as far
as I know) to get the full panic output but I can copy by hand and post
here if needed.

Have a good one,
Steve
