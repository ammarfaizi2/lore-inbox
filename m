Sure, but if there is a secret that must be protected, then it
isn't open source! 

By definition: open source is something I can give to absolutely anybody
with no reservations.  I.e. no need to protect anything. 

So your law means you can give someone code with the restriction that
they protect the trade secret within, but such code is not open source.
It may be less restrictive than many other commercial/proprietary licences,
(i.e. you can give it away for free, for example) but it is not _open_
with such restrictions. 

The linux source for example, can be given to anybody with no
reservations other than that the GPL is respected.  (The GPL does not
limit redistribution though.)
