This is the latest release of the -tiny kernel tree. The aim of this
tree is to collect patches that reduce kernel disk and memory
footprint as well as tools for working on small systems. Target users
are things like embedded systems, small or legacy desktop folks, and
handhelds.

This release is primarily a resync with 2.6.4 and contains various
compile fixes and other cleanups.

The patch can be found at:
