Under the GPL, nobody has to give any particular person copies of the
binaries.  They are free to sell binaries for whatever price they like.

But if you distribute binaries, you must either include or offer source
code.  Do they do this?  What software do they include that FSF holds
copyright on?   Where can I check this?

Do they include a copy of the GPL with the software?
