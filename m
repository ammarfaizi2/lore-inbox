Hmm, yeah, I see what you mean, but for me, proved stable is a couple of years of being in a major distribution, with people actually using it.

Now that major distributions no longer ship development kernels, (Slackware used to - I have slackware CDs with 1.3.x trees on them, for example), this is a less valid point.

..and yet there are still complaints that it doesn't work every day on the list.

Still marked as experimental, though.  Not stable yet.
