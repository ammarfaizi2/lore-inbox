As I am not on the list I would appreciate a direct response.

I have done some tests and my conclusion of the tests below is that there 
is an odd slowdown when compiling kernels, but not anything measurable when 
runnig Livid OMS. As Alan says my VIA MVP3 chipset is older and shouldn't have
the previosuly mentioned problems.

I remember talks about 2.4 being more RAM hungry than 2.2, but with 320MB I
believe I should be safe. No?

I therefore still wonder: Because of the slowdown I can see, is there anything
                          I can do to test, try out or tweak to get deeper into
                          a possible problem or are my benchmarks not 
                          significant enough?

Thanks for any pointer, hint or whatever you may throw at me :-)

All tests have been executed right after boot and nothing else is running 
(except a userlogin and vi to collect the info).

2.4.4-ac8 doing "time make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install" :

Three tests right after one another:

real    11m22.448s
user    10m39.480s
sys     0m42.700s

real    11m21.624s
user    10m38.900s

real    11m23.740s
user    10m39.650s
sys     0m41.500s

After those compiles the following info is available:

Then starting X to run Livid OMS the FramePerSecond numbers flicker between:
17 - 25fps

======================== 2.2.16 ===========================
The same for compiling the exact same 2.4.4-ac8 kernel while running 2.2.16

Three tests right after one another:

real    8m26.279s
user    7m8.630s
sys     0m39.260s

real    8m22.442s
user    7m7.850s
sys     0m38.280s

real    8m18.830s
user    7m5.980s
sys     0m37.780s

Then starting X to run Livid OMS the FramePerSecond numbers flicker between:
17 - 28fps

It seems to be a little higher than with 2.4, but as I am already biased and I
don't have any hard numbers I can't back it up.

Then the following info is available:

This is the /usr/src/linux/.config file for the 2.4.4-ac8 kernel. I didn't 
remove any lines as that would perhaps remove chances of discovering a mistake
