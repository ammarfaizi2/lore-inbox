   So, you'd be happy so long as bugz sent mail to the netdev mailing
   lists instead of to you?

The best power I have to scale is the delete key in my email
reader, when I delete an email it's gone and that's it.

bugme bugs don't have this attribute, they are like emails that
persist forever until someone does something about them, and this is
the big problem I have with it.
