My company has released a PCI NVRAM memory card but we haven't developed a 
Linux driver for it yet.  We want the driver to be open to developers to 
build upon.  Is there a specific path we should follow with this being our 
goal?  In researching Linux driver development I have come across "GPL" or 
"LGPL".  Where do you recommend we go to find out more about this 
development process?

Thanks and my apologies for using a technical forum for this question, but 
wanted to go to the right source.


Mike
