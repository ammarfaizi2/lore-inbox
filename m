Hello

IOnice only works with CFQ, have you checked that you are using the CFQ 
IO scheduler?
# cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler   #put the name of YOUR harddisk

In case it's not the default IO scheduler, you can change it with:
# echo cfq > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler


My two cents...
See you,
Eric
