SV> Only partially correct.  Linux will certainly be illegal under SSSCA.
could something be illegal if you created 10 years before the law :??
or it could be illegal if you continue developing it :?
do you realy thing linux will be declare illegal and Linus will be
under this law if IBM, SGI, HP, COMPAQ and so many other computer
giants are developing for linux and linux is so popular, i dont think
that nobody could stop it
"It would seem to me that your
insane interpretation of that insane law would mean that unix and it's

if i read well SGI(irix) HP(HP-UX) SUN (SOLARIS & SUNos)
COMPAQ(True64, VMS) would crash
because unix is ilegal.... i dont think so
