Hi All,

I tried loading a simple char driver on kernel 2.6 but it is giving invalid
module parameter.

This module is working very fine on kernel 2.4 . The kernel version I am
using is linux-2.6.5-7.97-smp.

I know that the insmod procedure has changed but dont know how to do it.

If anybody know the procedure , kindly tell this to me.





Thanks & regards ,
sujeet kumar
