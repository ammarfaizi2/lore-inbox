	All of these right conflicts are resolved by property rights. Yes, you can
keep and bear arms on your property, but you can't let a bullet fly onto the
circle K. Yes, you can smoke in your house or someplace under your control,
but I can designate my house smoke free if I want to.

	The author's right to profit from his creation is about as absolute a
property right as you can imagine. The author could, if he wished, refrain
from disclosing his creation to others at all if he wished. Because greater
rights include lesser rights, he can disclose them under restrictive terms
rather than not disclosing them at all.

	This, of course, doesn't ensure that he'll actually profit. That depends on
the actual value of his ideas.

	But his right to not disclose the idea if he doesn't choose to is as
absolute a right as one can imagine. And that greater rights include lesser
rights is nearly as absolute.

	But authors could already do this simply by distributing their works only
under contract. You could even have standardized contracts and sign before
you, for example, enter a movie theater or buy a CD.
