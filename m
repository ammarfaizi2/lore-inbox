Interesting.  Stuff that makes linux look good is good, but please
make it optional.  (Perhaps a kernel parameter, boot=pretty)
Simple users can have their pretty boot, but some of us think
the text console is cool too.  Much like having one of those
cars with a plexiglass hood so anybody may admire the
fancy engine.
