I'd suggest deep studies of Zen/Chan-buddhism, Taoism, logic,
discrete mathematics, c-programming, haskell or ml (functional
programming), algorithm-theory & analysis and a course or two
in operating-system theory.

At least, that's what I've studied. One could argue it didn't help
a lot, but...

The best thing of all to study is source-code, though. Learn from those
who already mastered the art of programming. I've head that Plan 9 is
available as source-code. Get it and learn from the best.
