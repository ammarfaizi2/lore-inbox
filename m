We'd like to run an editorial this coming Saturday about the
journaling filesystems available for Linux.  We'd like an author who
isn't a developer on any of them so he/she can give an object analysis
of the pros and cons of each and share thoughts on his/her opinions
about which should be eventually be supported by the kernel.

If you would like to do this or have a recommendation of someone who
would be good for it, please let me know privately.

Thanks,
Jeff
