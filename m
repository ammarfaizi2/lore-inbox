Hi,

	I have linux running my laptop Sony VAIO PCG-FR285M. A few weeks ago I 
compiled in to kernel CPU frequency scalling. I configured a few rules for 
cpufreqd and since then I see strange behaviour of the clock in this machine. 
First it was running slower than normal watch... i thought it has something 
to do with the hardware. But later on I observed that when the machine is off 
its clock runs perfectly fine. Now when the time zone has changed (I live in 
Poland) the clock started to run faster than normal watch. Now when I power 
off the machine time runs fine... I mean it was off for about a week and 
surprise... the time was still late but the same amount of time when I 
powered the machine off. So i guess it is not hardware related. What might be 
causing this? Anyway I am not shure if it is a coincidence that this happened 
when I compiled in CPU frequency scalling stuff and it is kernel related or 
whether it is caused by some buggy user level software because I emerge 
system && emerge world once or twice a week. I might add that when the clock 
runs odd the machine is not powered from battery. It runs AC power supply so 
the CPU uses its full frequency (2.4GHz). (I didn't test what is going on 
with battery).

BTW. The clock was getting late approx. 1h a day.

Here is some more info:
