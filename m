I'm not Linus, but i think he does not want nothing of this at all. He cares about 
the kernel. The kernel does not know about politics, the kernel knows about 
HARDWARE.

Why people continue bitching about this? It's just a tool. Maybe we should 
just start flaming Coca-Cola because it does not open source the formula of the 
soft drink.
