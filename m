If SuSE is such a problem for you, then don't support their distro.

The GPL explicitly allows them to do what they are doing with their 
kernels.  There is nothing unethical about them shipping patched kernels 
and calling them "Linux".

The problem is not with SuSE.  The problem is with your expectations.
