Not so. More people would mess up the firmware upgrade and destroy drives
which were working (for them) without error than would be helped. Two old
adages apply here, "first, do no harm," and "if it ain't broken don't fix
it." I never upgrade firmware unless I have a problem or need a new
capability, new firmware can have new bugs.

With that I *totally* agree, tech support should be on top of this.
