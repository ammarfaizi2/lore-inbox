The PDF at the link behind "Strafandrohung" is the scanned version of a 
court decision.

The judge said SCO is no longer allowed to publically state that Linux 
illegally includes IP owned by SCO and/or that Linux user might be sued 
by SCO.

The decision of the judge only affects what SCO is allowed to publically 
state at the moment. This has no influence on any lawsuits now or in the 
future.
