I'm now booted to 2.6.16.11, and here, from my buildit script, is the 
list of patches used, most of them simply saved to /usr/src from this 
list:
VEROLD="linux-2.6.16.9"
# This is the src file to be used
VERSRC="linux-2.6.16"
# These are the patchfile(s) to be used
VERP1="../patch-2.6.16.3"
VERP2="../patch-2.6.16.3-2.6.16.4"
VERP3="../patch-2.6.16.5"
VERP4="../patch-2.6.16.6"
VERP5="../patch-2.6.16.7"
VERP6="../patch-2.6.16.8"
VERP7="../patch-2.6.16.9"
VERP8="../patch-2.6.16.10"
VERP9="../patch-2.6.16.11"

They are applied in the above sequence further down in the script, and 
they are all error free in application, and now in running that kernel 
too.
[root@coyote src]# uname -r
2.6.16.11

Anyplace you are using a bz2, replace it with the .gz version and see if 
you still have the problem.  I'm not betting one way or the other, but 
it sure tastes like it to me.
