Yes. I know and understand what you said! ;-) I only added that it
might not be a hardware bug - but a miss-programming or interpreting
of the hardware, introduced in one of the last 2.4.1x kernel! I never
got this in the past and now I get it on ALL machnines!

Or was this debug-message introduced in a 2.4.x kernel and this
situation was simply ignored?
