"test"?  I know exactly whats going to happen, and unless folks like
hotmail.com and others get their act together I'll certainly end up
removing *@*hotmail.com from the lists by the end of that day.

That is the whole point of this experiment.

Alan plans on doing similar things to ftp.linux.org.uk and other
machines he maintains.

The behavior of these sites is simply intolerable, and I think
this is a wonderful way to get our point across.  I cannot see it
being argued that these entities have not been given enough notice
of the problem.  If they cannot be bothered to get fixed an issue like
this after nearly half a year, I cannot be bothered to feel bad for
them when all users at their site lose access to the lists.
