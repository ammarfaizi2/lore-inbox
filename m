Long ago it happened every once in a while that I added a key type.
In such a case one got new kernel keyboard headers, had to recompile
loadkeys with the new headers, use that new loadkeys to regenerate
defkeymap.c, and then recompile the kernel.

This shows why defkeymap.c is not generated in the kernel build
but distributed.
