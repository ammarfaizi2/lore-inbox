Work for me. I've run a profitable small open source company, I've worked
for Red Hat.

Think about it this way. There is no reason to suppose that the concept
of the Innovators Dilemma does not ultimately apply to nations. If you
accept that premise - and there is a lot of evidence for it, then the
western european nations get more and more specialist and "up market" and
eventually run out of anything to sell but lawyers. At which point we get
the great depression mark 2.

Hans Reiser's team of Russian wizards is simply a couple of years ahead of
everyone else moving all real software development to the czech republic
and india, the phone support to the philipines and the hardware to 
taiwanese and chinese bulk build to order.
