Hi all

I think I'm about to make a stupid question, but still can contain...

Is gcc 3.2 supported to build linux kernel ???, any known problems ???

I have a "crc error" in the first step of the booting process, just
after lilo screen goes off.

I attach my config file, It's the first time i try to build a kernel
with gcc 3.2, I havent had big problems before ( gcc 2.9X ) on mandrake
and redhat.

Thanks for any comments
Max
