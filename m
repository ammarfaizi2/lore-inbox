Hello,

Has anyone ever seen info on or worked on either of these 2 unrelated
pieces of hardware?

- Compaq fingerprint scanner - Compaq P/N: 294321-001, Spares P/N:
294427-001.  - Or, anyone have docs on this?

- 3COM 3C916B 10/100TX Network in a Dell Cdock Docking Station.


Any info would be appreciated.


Thanks!

Ian
