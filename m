Uh... use their ISP relay service anyway???
I take my laptop all over, to lot's of my clients locations, and if I
could relay through their servers, then I had better give them some good
advice.. Some places I just pick an available IP and it might not be in
the allowed relay list.  And this happens when I am in M$ or Linux..
And sometimes, I even go to locations where they can't tell me their
ISP's SMTP mailer.. Not to mention, I shouln't have to reset my
configuration for each location I happen to be at..
The point is, if it is a pain, then people will be less likely to
contribute..

My point was that.. the LKML shouldn't make it tough for legimate
posters.. And if someone's purpose is to spam the list, they can get
around DULS easy enough..
