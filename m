Yes, and most of them are for Linux.  Just go to Freshmeat and browse through
the email client section.  You'll see lots of in-development email clients, and
most of them have "filtering" on the to-do list.

In fact, I was unable to find an full-featured GUI email client for Linux, so
I'm using Polarbar, which is an all-Java client.
