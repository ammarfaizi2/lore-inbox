One of us is not getting it, maybe it's me.  To build something like
you describe is pretty easy IF AND ONLY IF all you are asking for is an
update mechanism.  As soon as you want revision history, diffs, rollbacks,
modifiable files, etc., you have to go to real BK.  Is that OK?  All you
want is a "keep me up to date" mechanism?  No diffs, no history, it's a
replacement for tarballs and patches?
