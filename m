A kernel compiled with a different gcc went very well. I found it strange
that the gcc I previously used (which I always use for compiling) gave that
error, so I recompiled it with that compiler and rebooted... which went
alright.

I can only guess what has mishappened. My /boot was full, but I hardly think
this was the problem. 

Oh well, it goes well now, no need to complain, do I? ;-)
