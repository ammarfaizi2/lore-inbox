   compaq laptops?  desktops?  or alphas?

Absolutely no idea.  This was one I inherited from Alan's list.  If Alan
or someone else doesn't speak up on this one, I'll remove it from the
list....  (at a guess, it might be the docking station bug that's
already been fixed, but without more information I'm only guessing).

   I thought this was complete a long time ago?

Could be.  Jeremy?
