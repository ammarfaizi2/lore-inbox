  I am not quite sure, but I suspect this is symptomatic of quirks of
  the Majordomo.   If in request message headers the  From:, Sender:,
  and Reply-To: headers DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ADDRESS in them, then 
  the Majordomo will essentially show the middle-finger.

  I have a tool to quickly remove somebody's address from the lists,
  and I have used that.  I don't have a tool to add somebody.
  That must be done via Majordomo requests.
