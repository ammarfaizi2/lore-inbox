  You shouldn't buy software from crappy "on_last_legs"

Lets stop there eh? AL <self snipped>QAEDA ? ANY GOV.T

Say M$ bought company that has "we can change this license 
at any time
for this version of software" written in its license, M$ 
changes it and BOOM! Software now costs another $400,000
to use... 

My DRM would not allow this... Good Eh?

Also GPL sources wouldn't work in proprietary work(s).
