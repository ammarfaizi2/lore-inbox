There are several distinct approaches which have been enumerated in
other mails.

Since this point has not been addressed, I'd like to focus on the major
difference in philosophy.

SDE places all policy in the hands of the policy developer in a seperate
policy program.  udev places the policies in the main processing loop of
the system, effectively implementing whatever policy is desired by the
udev maintainers.

Without seperating policies from the core executive of device naming
system, the core of udev suffers from the same issues as placing policy
in the kernel suffers.   Lack of maintainability, lack of user-defined
functionality, bloat, etc.

No but this is definately a good idea.
