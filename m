Subject: Admin: don't cross-post to the LVM list!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

  Hi, all. Please do not cross-post messages on the LVM list to other
(open) Linux lists. I just did a reply and got a nastygram saying my
message pending moderator approval. That's a nasty trap, as people who
respond to a cross-post should not be bounced.

So, please don't crosspost when sending to a closed list.

				Regards,
