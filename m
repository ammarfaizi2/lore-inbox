Apparently yes - the Compaq manual says that new tapes shed a 
lot, and that cleaning has to be more frequent with them.  They
recommend (this is from memory) cleaning the tape drive after
just 6 hours use of a new tape, then less frequently thereafter.

I figured after reading the manual that a weekly clean should
normally suffice.
