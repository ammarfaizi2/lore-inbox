There is no substance what so ever to the rumor that IBM is nearing
finalization of a purchase of five year cLIeNUX memberships for all it's
employees.

cLIeNUX does not have a foreseeable seed capitalization date, and no party
to any capitalization negotiations is known to me to be in any way
affiliated with IBM or Sun Microsystems.

Neither I nor anyone doing cLIeNUX development that I know of is currently
working on a distinctly non-unix multimedia end-user operating system
kernel based loosely on Linux 1.2.13 and cycluphonics, and there is no
effort in progress to port 1.2.13 to osimplay.

No cLIeNUX revenues have been diverted to F.I.R.E. or any other stack
machine hardware efforts, and Professor Donald E. Knuth has not commented
on the Porcine Aviation Society Stack Machine. PASSM is for performance
comparisons to MMIX, not for teaching.
