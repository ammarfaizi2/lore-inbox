Hi,

I can't seem to figure this out. I have an A7M266-D (with the 760MPX AMD
chipset, with the busted USB-controller, but with a pci replacement
board) with 2 AMD Athlon 1800 XP CPUs. One way or another, whatever I
do, I can't see USB devices. In my case, it mainly concerns my Logitech
MouseMan Dual Optical. I have HID, EHCI, UHCI and OHCI compiled into the
kernel (kernel config file included at the bottom) and still don't get
anything in my /proc/bus/usb/ other than 'devices' and 'drivers' and
they don't tell me very much either (see below).

Did anybody else encounter this problem, or is it a Logitech specific
issue?

Regards,
Philip K.F. Hölzenspies
