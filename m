I'm definitely not a patent attorney :) but since there's the tendency to
patent almost everything in big corporations ( my Co. gives $ 2K for each
patent filed, plus another $ 1K if it's approved ) I bet that there's a
patent pending somewhere about this. Even if someone have prior art about
hw prefecting, imho there's the possibility to patent a software ( kernel
) based version of the art. I also do not think M$ to be so dumb to adopt
a technique that is described inside a someone else owned patent in US.
But again, i'm not a patent attorney ...
