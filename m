	Oh yes, Dell that mainstay of high-performance
computing... and of clustering BTW!  ;-)

	The day Dell 4-way 32-bits CISC machine clusters start menacing
32-way 64-bits RISC machines I'll see your point.

	Until then, it is simply a case of Dell not managing to make a
dent on a financially attractive, but technically too difficult for
them, market.

	Or perhaps the Hurd will, if damage and confusion are too
widespread here.  But I hope not.
