I've posted another patch.  Te previous patch for some reason had
some fixes to NTFS included as well.  Corrected.  This patch is 
located at ftp.timpanogas.org:/nwfs/nwfs-2.4.15-pre5-4.gz and incorporates 
the NetWare File System (NWFS) into Linux kernel 2.4.15-pre5.

This patch is submitted to Linus for consideration of inclusion into
the Linux kernel.
