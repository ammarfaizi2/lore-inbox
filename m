How much raw speed do you think I can manage to get out of a really cool
n-way server from Compaq? I beleive we'll go for a Compaq server, as
that's what's been decided some time ago.

I read something by Linus about linux scalability, and I beleive he said
that 'linux [2.4] scales good up to 4 cpus, but not that good futher on
[to 8?]'. Can anyone fill in the holes here?

thanks
