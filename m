Maybe he works at a company with a good enough business model to realise
that people who can't or won't use tools for pet high horse reasons are
ineffeciencies that are best "downsized" either in ego or personnel
count.

"If you aren't going to spend the time to do the code right"

Well DAC960 isn't his code. DAC960 hardware is also opaque. Its
unfortunate you can't seperate the right and wrong way to use a debugger
and what you learn from it. It's a tool nothing more. Its what you do
with the data you get from it that matters. A debugger is a great way to
make pigs apparently fly, but that isnt its only use
