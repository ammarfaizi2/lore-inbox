The collateral effects caused by email-based virus scanner software
creating bounces to faked email addresses is getting to be more of a
problem to control than the viruses themselves.

I've recently been getting mails from sites "helpfully" informing me
that someone tried to send me a virus - they're not helpful at all.

I suggest that anyone receiving such things complain to the originating
site - if the virus is known to use faked sender addresses, it is
irresponsible for any site to generate a bounce.

When there are enough complaints to mail server admins, hopefully the
philosophy will change.

Any further discussion of this topic should be done off list.
