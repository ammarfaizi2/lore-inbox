If you are currently suffering under on going debacle related to the
removal of pwc/x support from the kernel you might direct your energies
to the Orange Micro iBot2 webcam:

There is a linux driver and the camera 

   is USB 2.0
   claims to have a 640x480 pixel CMOS sensor.
   claims to do full uncompressed raw capture

http://www.orangemicro.com/ibot2.html

There is however a shortage of them at the moment.  This is supposed
to change around September 3rd.
