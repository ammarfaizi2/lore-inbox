Graphics card companies don't realize they are hardware companies not
software companies and that it is hardware they make their money from?
Oh and they have too many lawyers?

It seems to me that 2D graphics are a done deal, with no new inovation
taking place.  Releasing programing specs for that part should be a no
brainer.  If the nifty 3D routines are so important to keep secret from
the other guys then well keep those.  Release the 2D programing specs!
