Well: shame on me... I didn't apply it correctly ;-(
Sorry for my %*%&ç stupidity!!!

Now I have a real usable 2.5 (I can only use one hand for the next 3
weeks, and having to run after my mouse because I use sunmouse was
really unconfortable...).

An hudge thank, I would really enjoy your patch being included in
2.5.46!!!
