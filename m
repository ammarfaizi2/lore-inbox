My Apple usb keyboard / hub and attached logitech keyboard does not work
with this kernel. An identical setup on test5 and test4-mm3 works fine.
Whenever the hotplug script from linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net runs at
startup I get the message "Disabled interrupt #5" and the light on my
mouse goes out and the keyboard is dead.=20
