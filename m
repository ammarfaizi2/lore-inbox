I find OE-QuoteFix and Outlook-QuoteFix do a nice job of making
Outlook Express and Outlook, respectively, more standards compliant in
this regard. In addition to fixing up the message quoting syntax to what
Matt described, they also cleanly handle line wraps. In short, they make
life much easier for those of us tied to Windows boxes at the office.
