So why did you trim the part of my quote that said that production
systems should always be backed up anyway?

It's not exactly much work to put a different disk in a machine.  With
a notebook, it might be 30-45 minutes work dismantling it, but on a
typical desktop, about 2 minutes, and on a rackmount server, probably
60 seconds.
