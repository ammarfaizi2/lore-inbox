Though OSDL may be funded by a group of large companies, in practice 
they're vendor neutral for this sort of thing. I suspect any requests 
to Tim to remove all hardware categories that wasn't from vendor X, 
or anything equally ridiculous would just result in a hefty poke in 
the eye ;-) Also, I think it's polite to give them the recognition they
deserve for hosting the site, and providing the machine in runs on.

I believe we have a common goal here ... to get 2.6 to be released in
a timely fashion, and to be as stable as possible.
