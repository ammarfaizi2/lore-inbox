i hate to bother you but i feel certain there is a
problem with the intel gigabit ehernet driver in the
2.6 kernel, i have an Intel Corp. 82544GC Gigabit
Ethernet Controller and run gentoo this driver works
fine with in 2.4 sources but i have tried multiple 2.6
sources and it just fails to bring the ethernet up. it
did used to work in older development releases but
when they went into the 2.6test phase.
i am sure it is present in kernels 2.6test6 to 2.6 but
cant remember the last one it worked with sorry
 if i can provide any config files etc i will gladly
send them and if this is a problem on my end i am very
sorry for wasting your time but i have spent over a
month trying to find a fix

thanks for all your fine work
Ewan Paton
