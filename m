I think this is undisputed.

This is where you are wrong IMMHO. All that is needed for you
to distribute the hexdump blob under the GPL is a declaration
from the copyright holder saying "this, to me, is the
preferred form for modification of the firmware and hence the
source code under the GPL."

After a *lot* of discussion, it was deliberated on d-l that
this is not that tricky at all, and that the "mere
aggregation" clause applies to the combination, for various
reasons, with a great degree of safety.  (Safer than that,
only after court) :-)

Now, if the firmware was specifically designed to work with
the linux driver, than it *is* a derivative work on the kernel
as a whole and the source code should be provided upon
redistribution as per GPL section 3 etc.

*BUT* this does not preclude Broadcom from stating: "our
engineers generated by hand the hex codes that make our
hardware work."

No-one is saying that the linker "merely aggregates" object
code for the driver; what *is* being said is: in the case of
firmware, especially if the firmware is neither a derivative
work on the kernel (see above) nor the firmware includes part
of the kernel (duh), it is *fairly* *safe* to consider the
intermixing of firmware bytes with kernel binary image bytes
in an ELF object file as mere aggregation.

Disagreed.
