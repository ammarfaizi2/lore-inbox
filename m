The many, many people who do need new kernel functionalities, but need
to control all their existing hardware and simply won't trash a
perfectly good PC just because it's the trendy thing to do, since:

they can find a ton of more meaningful uses of the same money (dance
classes, extra days of vacation, clothes, theater...)

they simply don't have that money

See the project in my signature, or the "Unbloating the kernel" thread
here for the big picture.

Ciao,
