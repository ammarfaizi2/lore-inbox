The FAQ blesses the idea of people setting up incremental download services, 
condems the idea of asking Linus to change his procedures to support this.  
It has nothing to say about the idea of leveraging the cml2 code base to let 
apt-get configure and build kernels better, which was the point of my post.
  
Presumably you want this question added to the FAQ? ;-)
