Not really. I struck triple indirection off the list because I decided not to
go that far yet. I haven't yet persuaded emacs to automatically update counting
words in this situation:-)

Ramfs with on-disc caching, perhaps? :-)

I'd have to provide cache file pinning to prevent them being automatically
recycled, but I want to do that anyway for other reasons.

It'd also be nice to be able to use it as emergency swap, but I think that
might be a little tricky, though if you pin a file, give it a maximum size, and
swap it on you could probably do that.
