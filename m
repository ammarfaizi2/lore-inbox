I get the following error repeatably; it seems to be related to SMP
which I do not have.

PS

If i add the lines

#undef __LINUX_SMP_H
#include <linux/smp.h>

immediately before the #include <linux/kernel_stat.h>
then it compiles, but a similar think happens later in kernel/status.c
(I think on wrong machine now) and if I fix that it happens again in
fs/partition or the like so it seems time to give up!
