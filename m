Hi,
So far, has I can understand. Seems to me that my computer which have a
Pentium D (Dual Core) on VIA chipset, also have unsynchronized TSC and
with the patch of hrtimers on
( http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.18/ ) 
Kernel found and use a new clocksource, the acpi_pm. And works stable
but I don't deny that could be a little slower.

Just to point out. This could be more a problem of chipsets than CPUs
(AMD or Intel). AMD just begin first using x86_64 archs :)

Last Note: 
I still have other minor problem, seems (to me) related with SATA
drives. Kernel 2.4.19-rc3 have big changes on SATA and I like to test it
but can't apply hrtimers patch (I don't understand half seems in kernel
other half not). 
In rc3 with jiffies clocksource even with boot parameter "notsc" I have
unsynchronized issues and many "Lost timer tickets", but I can say that
is a regression because computer never work well.

Thanks,
