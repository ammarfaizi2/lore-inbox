	I'm very ignorant when it comes to Ethernet, but I'd like to
	know which cards have this feature, as I'm planning on buying
	a new one for my small home LAN (if they aren't expensive
	enough). And, of course, cards whose Linux drivers are able to
	use this feature...

	Any comments are more than welcome.


	Thanks in advance, Roger...
