I went to New Mexico for Christmas to see my 100 year old Cherokee 
Grandmother.
After reading all the junk on the internet about me people have written 
about me and this
whole mess with Linux, she offered two very wise comments:

1. "When people say or write things about you, its a reflection on them, 
and not you."

2. (looking at me intensely) "The cure for stupidity is silence."

So I have to say, if you feel those who write applications for Linux are 
freeloaders
(I take this to mean a freeloader is someone who doesn't give you their 
IP but
uses the Linux platform to sell vertical apps), then you are saying you 
don't
care about supporting vendors who commercialize Linux (expect those who
give you back IP or money).

I think I got this right. Did I miss anything?

You don't have to respond. Remember the cure for stupidity is silence.

[Jeff sitting in char also not caring but trying to cure his stupidity 
by being silent]

Jeff :-)
