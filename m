Hello,

Is the Compaq Smart Array 5XXX driver 2.5.x ready?  Before I get to
far into debugging this computer I figure I would ask.  It boots fine
in 2.4.x kernels but when I try 2.5.70 it freezes at the Uncompressing
Linux line.  I thought maybe I didn't the console set up right for 2.5
but as far as I can tell it is and even if it wasn't it should still 
continue
booting and eventually be pingable.  My first thought was of the
RAID controller.  This is on a HP Proliant ML530.  Any suggestions?
Config attached.

Steve
