And all of us count that way.  Oh yes, the English unit is *so*
attuned to nature... this is why we have different measures for dry
volume, wet volume... avoirdupois versus troy weight... oh yes, energy
is measures in BTUs and power in horsepower... what is the conversion
factor between them (it has the dimension of time?)

Bullsh*t.  They seem more natural to you because you're more used to
them.  Anyone who hasn't grown up on the system think that Fahrenheit
is the ultimate in lunacy.
