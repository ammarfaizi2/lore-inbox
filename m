You miss my point.  Sure he's entitled to them.  But why should he
*have to have them*?  They're extra state which, in the presence
of a proper autoconfigurator, he doesn't need.

Militias, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves and
include all men capable of bearing arms. [...] To preserve liberty it is
essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be
taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.
        -- Senator Richard Henry Lee, 1788, on "militia" in the 2nd Amendment
