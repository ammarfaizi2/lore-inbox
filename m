	Including the source with the product would be insufficient to meet the GPL
requirements. They would have to offer the source (or a written offer to
obtain the source for no more than the cost of physically copying it) to
everyone who downloaded their software from their web site. The GPL is quite
clear that the source code offer must be made to anyone to whom the object
code is distributed. (The program must be accompanied by the offer.)
