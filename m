I'm not a big fan of fanatics and I see your point.  My perspective is
probably skewed from the whole BK experience.  These guys may be a 
waste of time but I don't see why they should be shut down.  I happen
to agree that there is a problem which needs solving.  If they want to
solve it, or better yet, if they simply act as a catalyst and someone
else solves it, that's cool by me.
