And beating ones head against the Linus-wall tends to end up with you
having a sore head in the end.

Either Kai will fix everything and not use kbuild-2.5 from keith (which
would be a shame) or eventually decide to use Keiths work.  And little
to nothing apart from time will give us one of the two solutions.

And FWIW, I like kbuild-2.5.
