Neil,

The following patches implement hardware accelerated raid5 for the Intel
XscaleÂ® series of I/O Processors.  The MD changes allow stripe
operations to run outside the spin lock in a work queue.  Hardware
acceleration is achieved by using a dma-engine-aware work queue routine
instead of the default software only routine.

Since the last release of the raid5 changes many bug fixes and other
improvements have been made as a result of stress testing.  See the per
patch change logs for more information about what was fixed.  This
release is the first release of the full dma implementation.

The patches touch 3 areas, the md-raid5 driver, the generic dmaengine
interface, and a platform device driver for IOPs.  The raid5 changes
follow your comments concerning making the acceleration implementation
similar to how the stripe cache handles I/O requests.  The dmaengine
changes are the second release of this code.  They expand the interface
to handle more than memcpy operations, and add a generic raid5-dma
client.  The iop-adma driver supports dma memcpy, xor, xor zero sum, and
memset across all IOP architectures (32x, 33x, and 13xx).

Concerning the context switching performance concerns raised at the
previous release, I have observed the following.  For the hardware
accelerated case it appears that performance is always better with the
work queue than without since it allows multiple stripes to be operated
on simultaneously.  I expect the same for an SMP platform, but so far my
testing has been limited to IOPs.  For a single-processor
non-accelerated configuration I have not observed performance
degradation with work queue support enabled, but in the Kconfig option
help text I recommend disabling it (CONFIG_MD_RAID456_WORKQUEUE).

Please consider the patches for -mm.

-Dan
