I will look into this -- I don't see any reason not to.

That may be a bit more challenging, but again, I'll look into it. The 
goal, of course, was not to waste your (or anyone's) work...

Snipped from http://scan.coverity.com:

"In collaboration with Stanford University, Coverity is establishing a 
new baseline for software quality and security in open source based on 
the analysis of over 30 of the most critical and widely used open source 
projects in the world. Under a contract with the Department of Homeland 
Security, we apply the latest innovation in automated defect detection 
to uncover some of the most critical types of bugs found in software.

We are making the results of our automated analysis available to the 
maintainers within the open source community. Additional projects will 
be added over time. Through this process, our hope is that the benefits 
of the open source model are further accelerated with faster and easier 
remediation of defects in open source."

I feared my original email was a bit too long as it stood...apologies if 
anyone felt misled.
