Dear Sir/Madam,

I represent GLOBAL IMPORT/EXPORT COMPANY based in the UK. 
My company exports cocoa and other goods/services for world 
trade. What we really require is someone who can represent 
this company in Europe and America We have been having 
problems with clients in these regions because they are 
politely refusing to pay for shipments on one excuse or the 
other so we need a representative that can assist us in 
clearing our money in their respective countries. 

Most of our customers pay out in cheques and we do not have 
an account in your country that will clear this money. 

It is upon this note that we seek your assistance as our 
representative in your country.

Be informed that as our representative, you will receive 
10% of whatever amount you clear for the company and the 
balance will be paid into an account we will avail to you. 
The second thing required of you would be for you to 
establish a relationship on behalf of our company with 
other cocoa industries in your country so that we can have 
new ideas and directions.

This job is rather easy and does not require a lot of 
expertise.

If you are interested in this business offer, please email 
me on this email address below: { 
james_grisham@zwallet.com }


Very Respectfully,


Mr. James Grisham, 
President,
GLOBAL Import/Export co.
Goods for Import/Export
Freight Fwdg. Svcs.
