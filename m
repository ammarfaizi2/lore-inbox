Actually EFF does have some good IP lawyers on staff and Robin Gross - a 
former EFF employee (robin@ipjustice.org) is also very up on this. And 
the prices is right too if you don't want to spend the big bucks. I 
would rather get legal advice from lawyer who care about GPL than 
lawyers who just want to run up a big fee and screw you in the end.

It might be worth looking into doing it right before some other SCO type 
decides they can get rich by busting Linux.
