Hello,
I try to compile the current kernel 2.4.17 on my AMIGA with PPC card (APU=
S). But this is not working as it can be seen in the attached file error.=
txt. With 2.4.16 it is the same. There is something wrong with the machin=
e-specific bootinfo-stuff as I would say. Well, I hope somebody can help =
me in this case. Do I something wrong? Tell me, if more information is ne=
eded!
Bye,
Andreas
