    News flash: it's a well documented fact that there was nobody at Sun who
    before or since has spent as much time as I have trying to free up Sun's
    code.  

Please tell your earlier self that I appreciate his work, and that I
am glad that that the opposition expressed in your previous message
did not deter him from doing it.
