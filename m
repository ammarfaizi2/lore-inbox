I've had someone point out that the perl script mangles non-UTF-8
filenames, and there is no correct behaviour for that case.

In fact the _real_ bug is that it mangles perfectly fine UTF-8 filenames.

It's a Perl quirk, but the behaviour is like that for compatibility
with non-UTF-8 filesystems.  I wanted to show how just using UTF-8 for
filenames isn't _yet_ as straightforward as it should be.
