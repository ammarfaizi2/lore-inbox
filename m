Note: a handful of computers, not a handful of computer.

Miniaturization is a Good Thing[tm], IMHO. I've worked on Computers for 
quite a while, and I was quite happy watching them shrink. Remember the 
Honeywell DDP-110, or which was it? The first computer which I managed to 
hide in a single corner of a room. With the incredible amount of 12 kB of 
storage. Were we happy...

Today, I can hide a computer in my pocket, playing mp3 files. No need to 
pull your cupboard behind you. Miniaturization is quite useful when it 
comes to carry things around.
