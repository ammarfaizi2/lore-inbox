and who are you, the thought police? Get off your high horse.

I'm sure he's well aware of the consequences of posting to this list, as 
I'm sure we all are. Hell, even *I* know all my mails to this list are 
going to be archived for eternity.

Look, if you want to be a productive member of our community, stop 
bitching about the way things *should* be, and submit some patches like 
everyone else. Code talks. Bullshit ... well, it doesn't do much but sit 
around stinking the place up.
