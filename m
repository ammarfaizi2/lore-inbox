True, and to second that with some facts, companies who were making this

because of Intel seemingly cancelling their projects.

Several companies in Austin, TX were chomping at the bit for people to
come work on Infiniband technology, but there has been nothing new

unless Intel, HP, IBM, someone with deep pockets and a marketing machine
can show it's viable for consumer use.
