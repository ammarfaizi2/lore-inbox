Well I'd have to agree that for stability I'd also go for 2.2.x.  2.4.x
isn't bad but 2.2.x is just rock stable right now.  Furthermore its been
hard to gain confidence in 2.4.x with all the bugs that have yet to be
worked out.  I'd use 2.2.x almost exclusively if it would just gain support
for the latest EIDE chipsets, a journaling filesystem, and the latest SMP
boards.  iptables and large file support would also be great.
