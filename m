Subject: Which kernel (Linus or ac)?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm presently running 2.4.8 on a machine. The VM on this is not terribly
good (swaps a lot with seemlingly plenty of physical memory).
I'm considering going to an -ac kernel, but I need recent iptables. Is the
iptables code up to date in -ac?
Also, which -ac do people recommend? I've beent trying to follow lkm, but
I'm somewhat confused at this point.

The box:

P200MMX 64MB

It's used as a firewall and a ssh login/through server for external connections.

Thx.
