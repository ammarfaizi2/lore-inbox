Off topic for lkml, I know. But since software
patents could have a huge impact on open source,
UK residents on this list should be aware that
the UK patent office is currently asking for
comments on changes to the patent law regarding
software and business patents.

>From their page:

"Should Patents be Granted for Computer Software or
Ways of Doing Business?"

"We want to know what you think about this so that
Government policy is evidence-based and relevant to
business, commerce, and consumers - in other words
to you. So, whether you are in the software industry,
financial services, are a software user, a consumer,
or are otherwise interested, we want to hear from you."
