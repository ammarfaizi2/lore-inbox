I've got the same problem here. I'm using a simple ext2 ramdisk here. I
also tried making a cpio archive for initramfs.

The kernel doesn't say anything. No "RAMDISK:", no "checking if image is
initramfs..." or something. I'm seeing that the kernel is looking for md
devices and directly after that he complains that he can't find device
fe01 (my ramdisk sets up lvm volumes via device-mapper) and panics.

I've looked through the changes and I'm puzzled, I really don't see the
problem. It looks like the initrd wasn't passed down to the kernel. I'm
using lilo. Do you have an idea where it would be wise to add some
debugging info?

I've attached my .config, unfortunately I can't give you a boot log. I
really need a nullmodem cable... :)
