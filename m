If someone distributes _on_their_own_ (site, CDs, whatever) copies
of Linux with their copyrighted code in it, or contributes copyrighted
code _that_they_own_, they are giving someone a license to use
against them.  That is actually one of the difficulties SCO is facing
right now in court; _they_ distributed copies of Linux _including_ any
code that they may claim is copyrighted.  Since they have the right to
license such code, any license that appears to be associated with it
when they distribute it becomes valid even if it was not before.  If you
distribute a copy of Linux under the GPL that contains code you
claim is violating your copyright, then I don't believe you have a leg
to stand on, legally.

I'm not sure what you mean here, could you rephrase it?

Same here!
