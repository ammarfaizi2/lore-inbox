Me, I've got the "men in black" song running through my head now.  And I 
don't particularly like it, either.

This reminds me of people going after metric speed limit signs with shotguns 
back in the late 70's.  I never understood this impulse before now.

Trust the ISO to change the BINARY nomenclature on something that has, until 
now, DEFAULTED to binary.  I get the feeling nobody at the ISO actually uses 
computers much.  Is it too late to sober them up?
