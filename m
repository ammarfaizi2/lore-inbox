I use external databases.

Trying to find interesting email among 'Hot Young Teen Girls', which
is at least honest, and among the less forthright emails trying to
masquarade as something else in order to get me to read them certainly
makes me angry regardless of how they are addressed.

Interesting philosophy.  You are saying that anyone may speak at you
and you have to at least read the subject line.  I wonder what your
corrollary for real life would be?

We are at absolutely opposite extremes.

Go see what my current company does:

I don't believe my statement implies that I don't.

I find it a matter of time.

I am glad for you.

Worldcontrol is from the book 'Colossus: The Forbin Project'.

That has always been a tough issue for me.  Your email, which was cc'ed
to l-k, will go into the various archives and forever be "findable" via
google groups and other archives.  If I reply offline from histories
perspective I will never have replied.

I have a particularly offensive and inflamatory piece addressed to Alan
Cox in my postpone box, but its somewhat off-topic and since I was out
sick for two weeks (in the hospital) I was really torn about restarting
the off-topic discussion.

On the other hand, when looking at the archives it looks like I didn't
respond to some criticisms, which in many people minds means they
are valid.
