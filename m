What did I say? I never implied that leasing software was illegal.
What I said was that software that expires after a certain time
has certain problems, the most basic of which is that a renter
who makes a good-faith effort to pay the rent, must be able to
retain ("enjoy") the use of the rented property. If software
expires and there is no leasor available for the renter to
make a good-faith effort to pay, the property must remain
usable until this problem is solved. If software is not capable
of remaining useful even after a leasor is no longer available
then the software cannot be leased (although it probably can be
sold because you can sell anything, including lemon cars as long
as the condition of the property is not hidden).

Furthermore, companies that sell public stock need to protect
the interest of their stockholders. If the viability of one
company is dependent upon the continuance of another company,
then, as they say in Houston; "We have a problem".
