OK, the obvious question:

If apache is 60% of the market and IIS is 25%
(and I have heard that apache on Linux is about
33% of the web server market) how do you see
that as windows/iis being more popular than the
linux/apache platform? and yet, windows/iis has
the lions share of vulnerabilities - your arguments
lie in tatters....

I think Unix's long history of multiuser, networked
operation gives it quite a bit more sophistication in
areas of security, as opposed to windows, a single
user system which has in the past few years
become widely networked.

I'm not saying Linux/Unix users should rest on their
laurels or be lulled into a sense of false security, but
come on, let's at least be realistic about the very real
advantages of Unix OSes over PC OSes in this area.
