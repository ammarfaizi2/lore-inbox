Two notes on that:
1) Please re-read my mail. I wrote "_external_ databases". I did not tell you
to _not_ filter _yourself_. 2) We are just on the brink of the "communication
century". Even if you don't like it, direct communication between people grows
immensly, whereas broadcasting the same information to many people is stepping
back. The reason is simple: people are beginning to dislike filtered (read 
censored) information quite a bit, they have simply been told lies too often.
SPAM is of nature broadcasted information, but anyway you would probably not
mind getting the complete same info as a mail _only_ addressed to you. Still
you would choose to delete it, because it may be of no special interest for
you, but you would most certainly not get that angry about it. What I basically
want to say: just live with it. I personally decided so, because I can very
well see the good point: no need to rely on censored (may be for political or
economical reasons) (tv-)broadcasted information about the world out there.
Today you can just talk to a lot of people around the world _personally_.

Well, I think this is good, you don't?

> Some people have spam filters, some don't.

In the end it's all a matter of who to trust more: yourself or others.

Just to give you a small glimpse: I get several hundred mails a day, my top day
in 2001 reached 832. Interestingly spam is no more than about 5%, and I use
_no_ filter at all (besides my brain :-).

And to end it: I don't want to have _any_ worldcontrol ;-)

Stephan

PS: If you want to go ahead in this talk, please keep it off LKML, it doesn't
look like common interest to me.
