* What is it?
--------------------------

Sysprof is a sampling system-wide CPU profiler for Linux.

Sysprof uses a Linux kernel module to profile the entire system, not
just an individual application. 

Of course, sysprof handles threads and shared libraries, and
applications do not have to be recompiled or instrumented. In fact
they don't even have to be restarted. 

Just insert the kernel module and start sysprof.


* Features:
----------------------

    - Profiles all running processes, not just a single application

    - Call graph support showing time spent in each branch of the call tree

    - Has a simple graphical interface

    - Profiles can be loaded and saved

    - Easy to use: Just insert the kernel module and start sysprof

    - Supports Fedora debuginfo packages


* Sysprof 1.0
--------------------------

This is the first release of sysprof with a 1.x version number. I am
very excited about that.

New features since Sysprof 0.91:

- support for x86-64, thanks to Mike Frysinger
- better reporting of time spent in the kernel

Please report bugs as well as success or failure stories to

* Where can I get it?
