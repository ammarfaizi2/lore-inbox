And which I haven't had a chance to check yet, the camera is still in the 
truck and I've been busier than a one legged man in an ass kicking 
contest today.  I did get 2.6.20-rc1 built and its whats running, but 
that is as far as I got, too many other honeydo's.  Tomorrow hopefully.  
If I don't wind up using a backhoe for a divining rod, looking for our 
sewer which is beginning to nag us occasionally.
