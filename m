[SNIPPED...]

I looked up domain in the dictionary and my eyes fell upon
diatribe, which I think describes the most common use of "domain".
Whatever happened to the word "group"? Why don't people just use
the word that was invented to represent commonality? Why do they
have to be "creative" and use words that are way out of context?
