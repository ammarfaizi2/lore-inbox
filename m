	I already run several sugarplum sites with teergrubes.  I also use
various blackhole lists and take other action against spammers, including
blocking entire rogue domains.  If that rogue domain happens to be a two
letter TLD, so be it.  If it gets bad enough, maybe they'll fix it.

	Actually, the most fun with the Chinese is to take advantage
of their "four horsemen of the Infocalypse".  Ours (in the US and many
other western countries) is "Drug Dealing", "Money Laundering",
"Pedophiles", and "Terrorists".  In China it's "Taiwan", "Tibet",
"Dissidents", and "Pornography".

	In discussing the Spam problem with some Chinese officials in
Beijing back in June of last year, they were really ho hum about the
whole thing till I mentioned that a lot of the spam being relayed out
of the Phillipeans through Chinese sites was promoting pornography.
That got some people sitting up real tight.  They didn't care that
their pipeline in and out of China was oversubscribed by an order
of magnitude and spammers were clogging it with trash, but they
damn well did care if that trash had anything to do with pornography.

	I've heard some people suggest that they mail message back to
spam sites in China thanking them for their mail and including some
propaganda on Taiwan or Tibet.  Maybe some Falun Gong literature would
be nice...

	Attack a social problem by turning another social problem loose... :-)
