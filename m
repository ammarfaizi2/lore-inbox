The license hasn't changed in almost a year, so perhaps you'd care to 
back up this "ever changing licenses" statement with some data?  Stop
spreading FUD, Alan, it's beneath you.  I could just as easily attack
Red Hat for getting patents, do you see me doing that?  

And just what rights have we removed?  Since the license hasn't changed,
it's sort of hard to say that the rights have changed.  More FUD.

And what format lockin?  It's an open format, GNU CSSC reads and writes
it just fine, and we've made a point over the years of telling them each
time we change something so that they can continue to read/write our
files.  More FUD.

No, I'm countering a pile of pathetic FUD from someone who has no
business spreading it.  I've taken a lot of crap in return for helping
the kernel effort and I'm sick of it.  I haven't noticed you, Alan,
taking a half decade off to code up an SCM system good enough for
Linus to use.  Without the benefit of having one to copy, by the way.
When you've done that you are welcome to critize how I went about it.
Until then, stop your whining.
