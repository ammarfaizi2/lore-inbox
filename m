I'm doing a project which port a component testing program in DOS which
use GPIB to linux
Does the Linux kernel support GPIB?


I find a linux gpib driver in the  linux lab project
http://www.llp.fu-berlin.de/

but the newest version is release at 1999 and i wonder if it still under
development..
Moreover,it is for kernel 1.2.x or 2.0.x and i wonder it will still work
on linux 2.4.x or not
