Actually, PIO modes (both read and write) have no error checking at
all built into them.

UDMA modes include a checksum on every transfer, for both reads and
writes.

Actually, if the drive is reporting the checksum error, it must be a
write (duh), and therefore the drive doesn't agree with how the card
is clocking the data, or something to that effect.

IDE controllers are pretty cheap, you might want to see if you can go
get a current generation card from promise, which will do the
Seagate's udma5 mode quite easily.  Shouldn't cost more than $35 at a
retail place like CompUSA, or $20 online.
