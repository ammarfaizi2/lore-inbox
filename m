Greetings;

This unfortunately is a one way message.  I've just gotten offline 
with verizon support, and one of their mail server machines was shut 
down early yesterday due to extreme latency issues, and they've NDI 
when it will be restored since parts availability on a holiday can be 
a problem, so I am not getting any mail *from* the list since about 
7:30 yesterday morning.

So basicly, I'm not ignoreing you, I'm just not getting 75% of the 
mailing lists I'm on.

When and if it functions again, I'll check the archives for any 
messages to me.

-- 
Cheers, Gene
