Hello all,

I've been seeing many Linux versions, with many features, some of them
just for the newest branches (2.4.x and 2.6.x), I would like to know
for which kind of system each kernel is recommended. On the distros
that we see inside the Net there is the 2.4.x series, normally I
update to 2.6.x (in case of my Slackware 10.2, even getting problems
with some devices). Is that floppy disks uses only 2.0.x and 2.2.x
Kernels? If applicable, where can I get (detailed) information about
these issues? I'm new on Kernel managing, started doing my own distros
at less than one month and would like to know it.

Thanks in advanced,
j4k3.
