You probably cannot "republish code under a different license" -
especially not if it was released under Author's rights (in german:
"Urheberrecht") which is not uncommon in continental Europe.
Anf getting rid of the GPL (which your "republish under some new
license" implies) requires IMO the explicit written agreement of all
concerned persons.

BTW the only possibility of getting rid of Author's right is to wait for
the death of the last author of a given text/music/source code and wait
than 70 years (as it stands now).

So you are simply forking a part of the Linux kernel thus making all of
the other code inthat project GPL and probably not gaining anything
else.
Have fun with your Linux kernel fork similar to all other forks ...
