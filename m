Subject: Any advantage to kernel 2.4 in low-end system?

Hello.

In reading about the cool new features of Linux v2.4, most of the
improvements/changes seem to relate to high-end systems.  Would users of low-end
systems (386/486, low memory, etc.) be advised to stay with kernel v2.2.x or is
v2.4.x the way to go for these systems as well?

Thank you.
