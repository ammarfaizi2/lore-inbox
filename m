I am talking about the former only. The latter has been discussed many times
and AFAICT is never going to happen. I suspect Linus will always take
patches from his inbox and will never say 'resubmit via linux-patches or I
don't take it'.

Maybe. Why filter the crap from linux-patches when you can subscribe to 
bk-commits and let Linus do it for you? :)
