ruby 2.4.X ?
does it exist?
there is nothing about ruby-2.4 on the linuxconsole web site, mailing list.
are there sources available anywhere?
does framebuffer console work in ruby-2.4

where can one get your latest work?
linuxconsole's cvs and bitkeeper have no changes since more then 4 months,
there where no diffs posted to the mailing list too.
