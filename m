Yeah this is the model. 
I doesnt show up until after the Kernel panic though.
Id love to get a more complete log. 
Is there any way I can save the log since it panics?
The best I can do right now is probably take photos of the screen
but if theres any way to make sure a log gets saved to the usb that would 
be best.
