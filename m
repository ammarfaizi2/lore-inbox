Why does everyone assume that Stallman is out to 'get revenge' on companies? 
Is his desire for freedom so hard to grasp and believe that all you can do is 
spin it into silly conspiracies?

Why do people not recognize that his GNU project has built significant things? 
Do you not realize that Linux is licensed GPLv2, which is also Stallman's 
license?

I'm not going to trumpet around in 'patriotic' support of Stallman for too 
long, but if you're going to go on a Stallman/GPL bashing tirade, try having 
some real reasons instead of moaning like a rock in the wind.

As for the implicit allegation that he's wrong for not accepting the 
"company's" way of doing thing, last I checked, most of this 'free software' 
stuff was started and written by people as a hobby, for themselves and their 
users -- not for companies. It just happens that Stallman's license allows 
business and industry to harmonize.
