This is correct. Its actually very important. A lot of GPL software is
created by a small company for another. It would be completely unfair
for that small company to be expected to ship stuff to everyone. Their
customer may choose to but then they must distribute sources and so in
turn.

Montavista feed a fair bit of stuff back into the kernel, especially at
the mips end of the universe.
