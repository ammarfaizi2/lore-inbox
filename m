Remote sessions have been there as long as the DISPLAY environment variable - I
think even X10.4, 2 decades and more ago, could do that.  I know that it worked
just fine 18 years ago with X11R1 (aah... building that from source on a 25mz
Sun3 took a little while). (Anybody know when the first instance of
pointing 'xmelt' at another user's machine for amusement was? :)

It's interesting that almost every attempt to devise something "better than X"
always seems to get as far as an Xterm-alike, an XClock-alike, a primitive
window manager, and 2 or 3 toy demo programs.  Then, unless you're Microsoft
or Apple, you discover that doing a complete window system is *hard*.....
