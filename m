As I stated before: there's many more people with lots of expertise *now*
                    and we appreciate that!

As our (former) list maintainer Ben Lutgens stated:
The rejetc answer contained information how to subscribe to the list which
is a seconds deal ;-)

Anyway: all LVM related lists at sistina.com are now completely open!

People already send hints to spam filters; thank you guys!

We take it like this and we take it serious that you got annoyed, no matter
what the actual reason is.

I think the facts that the sistina.com lists are open to everybody
now *and* that we will release policies to allow write access to our
CVS repository for major contributors *and* that we'll have a set of (small)
patches in the next couple of days to get vanilla updated will help a lot.

Thanks for the wake up call ;-) and all your support!
