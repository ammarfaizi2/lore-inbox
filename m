If Microsoft would start pissing off IBM and other major
companies which have big business interests in Linux by
invoking their patents, I can just imagine IBM coming down
on Microsoft with their own patents ...

"Hey you!  Stop flipping those bits!  Hold it right there!
 ... Don't you flip any more bits, read this patent first..."

(and I'm sure they must have patents on _setting_ bits as
well ;))

cheers,
