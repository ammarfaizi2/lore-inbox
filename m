Hi all,

I have an organization called the Linux Society, and I am helping the
Devil-Linux.org group (of sourceforge) develop their second generation firewall
CD boot linux.

We have been kicking around a custom ISO build kit using Webmin, and, kernal
compile configuration will have to be part of the equation.  I am wildly
guessing that I am in the right place for getting the modules !!

Quoting the sourceforge site: 

" Last updated 2001-Apr-15 by mec.
I suck at html ... that's why the page loads so fast! "

As I have not had time to play with the kit yet, I am hoping for some
generalized information which I can provide to my membership.

Do any of you have any rough notes or embryonic pages ??

I should mention that Devil-Linux is X phobic, requiring text applications
ultimately wrapped in www perl cgi scripts.

BTW, I should mention that my own embryonic support service will soon become my
degree project.

Thanks in advance,

John
