Hi,
are there any efforts or is there any progress in updating the CS46xx driver?
Is someone working on changing the DSP code to support multichannel output and S/PDIF output?
Is there someone out there who tries to reverse engineer the windows driver to enhance the ALSA driver?
Or has Cirrus released their specs for the DPS chip (I don't think so :( )?

If so I am willing to test and help this person(s) wherever I can.
I have a Terratec XFire 1024 with CS4624 chipset and want to use multichannel output without a soundserver and S/PDIF output (but this isn't as important as the multichannel output) without buying a new card

Thanks & Bye
