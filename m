I'm looking for some old code from March 2000 mentioned in the "Linux
loading Linux" thread from the LKML:

	http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0003.2/1339.html

Briefly, the module would load a new kernel image, ramdisk, command line
etc. by trying to put the system back into a post-firmware state and
launch the kernel.  It apparently lacked support for SMP systems.

The original link to the code is now a dead-end: 

	http://www.scyld.com/software/monte.html

and the original author is unreachable by the address listed.

If you've got a copy of the code stashed somewhere, or if you know of
more recent work in this area, I would appreciate a pointer.

Thanks,
Andy Pfiffer
