Hallo,

sorry if this is a silly question...
as far as I understood my smp-board seem not well designed - so I get APIC 
error messages nearly every 1-3 seconds. These mmessages do not help me 
because -so I was told - it is not possible to fix the problem.
Is it possible to eliminate these error messages. My logfiles grow enormously 
and are "trashed" with these messages...

I'm running Kernel 2.4.0ac2 successfully  hoping that "sudden death" will not 
come back...

kind regards
Norbert
