Gee, can all of us who have a business add there name to the thread
subject?  Look at all the advertising Nvidia is getting for free.
All they have to do is make a half step to the direction of more open
sourced, and they become the darling winner take all.

I positive Larry would love to have his product added.
Victor could enjoy the extra name caching in hits for it all.
Last time I checked I was bang 100K+ growth in website hit logs per day.

For all of the rants Nvidia Marketing must be in hog heaven!
