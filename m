First since it effects ATA it is my issue for the most part.
You have no stake or issue to pursue GPL violations if there are any.
Three, until you have copyright status, you have not right to invoke GPL
unless you are a customer of Dell, and are not bound by a contract to
Dell.  So get your facts first.

If there is a GPL issue with Dell and it involves my work, my lawyers will
contact Dell.

Cheers and have a good day.
