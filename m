Hello Michael,

Thanks for doing this. Could you tell me which criteria you have to
choose patches to go in? I see grsecurity in the to be merged queue
which is not likely to ever go into 2.4.x. It's more likely to be 
converted to the LSM framework (parts of it if still needed) and then 
integrated into 2.5.x.

Could you maybe out of consideration for AC use the newest 2.4.x
kernels, in this case 2.4.18pre1?

Happy New Year 2002 and best regards,
Roberto Nibali, ratz
