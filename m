I don't think one exists.

The thing is, there's an entirely non-legal reason to never do something 
like that, namely just the psychology of the thing. 

Licenses are important for legal reasons (because problems can arise), but 
I would say that licenses are even *more* important as to how developers 
see them.

And I know that I'm personally very much turned off by any license that 
grants any particular party any special powers. It doesn't matter _how_ 
much I respect or trust the party in question, I wouldn't want to use that 
license.

So any license wording that said that I have any special powers would, I'm 
sure, alienate a large portion of the people who matter - the developers.

So the thing is, we're _much_ better off with nobody that firmly "in 
charge", over the alternative. Everybody feels safer. Nobody needs to 
worry about me or anybody else suddenly going crazy. 

Remember: the perfect is the enemy of the good. Asking for things that are 
perfect "in theory" usually just results in things that are horrible "in 
practice".

So not having anybody in charge could _in_theory_ cause problems. But 
_in_practice_ it's a hell of a lot better than somebody that people need 
to worry about.
