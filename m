Hi Dean.

 > ...and DRM will dynamically recompile itself every 32 seconds...

...and thus will spend so much time recompiling itself that there
is no time to do anything else (since it will inevitably take 33
seconds to actually perform the compilation).

Personally, I see DRM as the best thing Microsoft could take under
their wings, as it's an almost sure-fire bet that any company that
whole-heartedly embraces it will soon go bust...

Best wishes from Riley.
