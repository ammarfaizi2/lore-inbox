A lawyer. The questions you are asking are inherently legal ones, and
any answer you get on this mailing list (which is a technical list,
not a legal one) is not going to be the *real* answer. The "ultimate
authority" you're asking for here is the court system, so if you're
concerned about legal liability for copyright infringement due to a
product you plan to distribute, you need to hire a lawyer.
