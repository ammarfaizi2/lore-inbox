The patent was for using the technique of using XOR for dragging/moving 
parts of a graphics image without erasing other parts.  Also, since the 
patent was granted in 1980, the inventors have had their 17 years of patent 
protection, and we're all free to use the technique - legally!

P.S.  Given that XOR is a basic boolean operation, I don't think the USPTO 
would ever be so dumb as to grant a patent on it.  But, then the PTO has 
shown a creative ability to grant patents to questionable ideas, so who can 
say what they would/could/will do?
