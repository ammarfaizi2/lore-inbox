I thought you were above deliberately tangling unrelated questions to try
and distract from my perfectly valid point.  

    "BitBucket: GPL-ed BitKeeper clone"
    "The goal of this project is to produce a system compatible with BitKeeper"

Let's try a little simple substitution since you seem to be needing coffee
this morning:

    "Red Cap: a proprietary Red Hat clone"
    "The goal of this system is to produce a system compatible with Red Hat"

Go run those statements by your lawyers, Alan, and then please report
what they said back here.
