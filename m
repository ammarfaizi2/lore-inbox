Yes I do realize that, but I think EVMS offers more in the long run than any 
of the others. I don't mean to speak ill of Christoph(he has done some very 
good work in the past, and I think he is very talented), In fact, I thought 
he handled the problems with EVMS very well at first(pointing out problems, 
etc.), but then as the thread went on you could tell he was just taking it 
more and more personally(for whatever reasons), and we all know that doesn't 
help getting things done, especially not with a deadline looming. I don't 
know as much as I should about all of this considering I am opening my mouth 
on the subject, but it seems that something needs to be done soon one way or 
another.
