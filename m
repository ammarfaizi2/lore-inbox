How did they offer this bounty?  Through the ubuntu announcements channels?

Like if, say, Linux International was to partner with TipJar.com to create
and maintain an organized open bounty system where stakeholders wanting
to see something could contribute to the pot for the feature and the first
implementor who passes the tests (including code readability!) gets the pot.

Write me off-list to become involved in this project or to direct me to
an already existing project so I don't waste more time on wheel reinvention?
