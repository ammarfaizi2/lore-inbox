In the last week I have started getting some of those reports,
irregularly, on a Compaq Proliant ML370 (ServerWorks chipset, 1x1G PIII,
1G RAM), though the machine is about 2 months old. I am running RedHat
6.2 with their latest kernel RPM - 2.2.19-6.2.7 It has been running that
kernel since the day it was installed.

Regards,
Steve
