No, John, it's quite obvious that it's _you_ who does not understand.
You've saved yourself some spam and pissed off a good deal of the
kernel list, including the ones who are in the best position to help
you. Was it a good trade?

When so many clueful folks disagree with you, perhaps you should
re-examine your actions and ask yourself if they are all wrong, and
you know better than all of them, or the inverse.
