Absolutely! For the CE space, the resources for this
should come from CE companies.  I've been thinking about
the practicalities and logistics of doing this in
the CE Linux Forum, or of encouraging member companies
to do this for their own products.  I wouldn't even
consider making a request that non-CE-related people
do this.
