Well given that I get emails for "embedded" space nagging me about
supporting their stuff yet they will not reveal the alterations to the GPL
code they borrowed, and moan when the discuss of paying for consulting on
opensource they have illegally closed.  Yeah, I have zero compasion for
the embedded folks.

Gee every considered embedding somthing with a little horsepower?

So again, if you want change?  Submit it.
If you want a consultant?  Pay for it.

Next running around calling people "hackers" is not the best way to win
friends.  Do you think you could sell your embedded cruft if you told your
customer base, "Gee, I am just a hacker.  Please buy my product."

Dead thread for me now.

Cheers,
