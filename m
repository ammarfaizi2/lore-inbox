I have to agree - besides, I actually think 2.6 sounds _cooler_. It
implies a more refined, developed and enhanced version of the current
kernel (which it is!), rather than a new and untested thing. There's so
much suspicion of "dot-oh's" these days, and some of the major features
for 2.6 didn't make it in this round, so indeed, no justification for
3.0....

Cheers
