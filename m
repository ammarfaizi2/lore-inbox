Hi,

has anything changed with C1 halt? I mean it seems that CPU Disconnect 
doesn't get called (Though I enabled it), as with 2.6.3-mm4 (yesterday 
and today going back) my idle temps are about 46-47°C. Now with 
2.6.4-mm1 they went up to 50-52°C.

Using same config. I attached mine for 2.6.3-mm4.

I guess it is some sort of ACPI issue? Aside from the temp rise, I 
haven't noticed any regression. I will try 2.6.4_rc1-mm1 later again, to 
  verify my observation. Anything else I could check?

bye,

Prakash
