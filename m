Err, here's a news flash.  Dell has just one server with more than
4 CPUS and it tops out at 8.  Everything else is clusters.  And they
call any machine that doesn't have a head a server, they have servers
starting $299.  Yeah, that's right, $299.

How much do you want to bet that more than 95% of their server revenue
comes from 4CPU or less boxes?  I wouldn't be surprised if it is more
like 99.5%.  And you can configure yourself a pretty nice quad xeon box
for $25K.  Yeah, there is some profit in there but nowhere near the huge
margins you are counting on to make your case.
