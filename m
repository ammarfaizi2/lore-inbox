Hi Adam,

There is a reason why I set the Mail-Followup-To header, so please include me
when replying to my mails.

That particular procmail filter is mine, and not public.  The request
for blcklisting is for exactly that one, public lkml as was written
rather clearly in my mail that you full-quoted in your response.

Sorry, Adam - if it was just that one thread I couldn;t care less, but
please check your inboxes for posts from Richard to lkml that actually
were technical instead of forcing his questionable ideas of "freedom"
to the linux devlopers.  He has so far posted only offtopic to this
list, and that's what pisses me off.  He doesn't try to contribute
to the fursther development of the kernel but instead tries to abuse
it as forum for his political opinion.

I don't like those flames either - but there's a small difference:
LArry actually takes part in technical discussions (although BK
advert^H^H^H^H^Hexplnation has taken a little overhand lately), he
has never started a thread just to tell anyone about his business
modell, and he doesn't try to force us into his nbusiness modell
(Or have you ever heard him complaining about RHJ not following
his oftware license?)

GPL violation only make sense if they affect code in the mainline kernel,
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is certainbly ontopic here as it's a part of the kernel
- FSF propaganda is not.

I explained it a few times, but people still don't want to get it.
This is fsckin' not about censorship but about banning people who
aren't capable by themselves to find the appropinquate forum.  No one
tries to hinder him posting his opinion to gnu-ethics, linuxtoday (*)
or slashdot.  I just think such a request is the last thing we can do
about people ignoring the technical list spirit again and again.

(*) not sure whether he wouldn't only post to gnulinuxtoday, though..
