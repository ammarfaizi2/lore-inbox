	Perhaps not the most appropriate place to but I know someone here will know:  
Has anyone found specs for the Sandisk WiFi + CF card?  We're trying to 
figure out if the electronics on our CF slot will support it.  I'm trying to 
determine if the CF card is run as an IDE interface, or a block memory 
interface, and which interface method is used to talk to the Prizm chipset.

	Sandisk has been remarkably unforthcoming about answering emails.
