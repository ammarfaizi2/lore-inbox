This BitKeeper subject resurfaces every week or so and probably accounts for 
5-10% of the linux-kernel mailing list traffic. While a terribly interesting 
topic to some - it really isn't about the kernel. Could someone be so kind as 
to create a linux-kernel-bitkeeper (or linux-kernel-revision-control) mailing 
list so that these discussions (which obviously are not going away) can have 
a proper home?

 cheers,
