You pay taxes to support the washington monument.  When's the last time you 
paid a tax to Linus?

He's the editor of a periodical publication.  A cross between an academic 
technical journal which people contribute to for professional reasons, and a 
hobbyist fanzine that people contribute to 'cause it's cool.  This is not a 
new thing, there are real-world precedents for this sort of relationship 
going back hundreds of years, to the invention of the printing press...

Linus's editorial decisions are as final and unappealable as any other 
editorial decision at a magazine or newspaper.  You can publish your article 
elsewhere, and if it doesn't have the same prestige as the Harvard Law Review 
or the New England Journal of Medicine, tough.  They said no.

And like ALL editors, his job isn't to write a significant portion of the 
articles in the publication, but to be a Sturgeon's Law filter throwing out 
99% of the submissions in the slush pile, correcting the spelling and grammar 
of the remaining few, and trying to stitch them together into a coherent 
whole.

Go track down somebody with a Journalism degree if you want to understand 
Linus's job.

If you get an article published in Time magazine, and you say that this gives 
you the right to print your own copies of Time and distribute them yourself, 
Time's lawyers are going to come after you.

The GPL gives you the ability to do this, but it doesn't obligate the 
publication's editor to listen to you.  If next month's issue contains a huge 
rebuttal to one of your articles, calling you a boogerhead, tough.  The 
editor doesn't owe you anything as a previous contributor, and certainly 
doesn't owe you anything as someone from whom he did NOT take a submission.

What Linus basically said was that if a significant number of distributions 
integrated it, he might take another look at the thing in the future.  But 
wasn't going into 2.5.

Now, thanks to people pestering him beyond the Annoyance Event Horizon, he's 
got his fingers in his ears.  Congratulations.  Hopefully, he'll calm down a 
bit in a few months, but there's no guarantee.  In the mean time, the most 
productive thing to do is drop the topic and work on the Red Hat, SuSE, and 
Debian guys.  (Mandrake feeds from Red Hat, and SuSE is now making kernels 
for Connectiva and TurboLinux.  Gentoo and Slackware might be good to bug as 
well...)

See if you can convince Alan Cox to pick up your patch.  That'll get you Red 
Hat, and the single largest concentration of roll-your-own kernel guys 
outside of Linus's own tree.
