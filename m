I honestly don't undestand how this myth got started, Dave.

>From my point of view, I have been busting my ass trying to *extract*
requirements from Linus and other people with a stake.  What guidance
I get is vague and contradictory.  My proposals to address it get ignored.
Everything I do right gets written off and teensy side issues get 
inflated into monsters.

It's utterly maddening to hear people accuse me of not listening when
I spend so damn much effort trying to do what they want for so little
reward...
