I'm assuming that you're questioning Jefferson's role.   Here are a couple of
quotations which show that Jefferson's idea predated the official 
implemenation.    I can do more digging if need be.

1791 - "Jefferson Report." Thomas Jefferson described England's weight and 
measures standards to Congress "on the supposition that the present measures 
are to be retained," and also outlined a decimal system of weights and 
measures of Jefferson's conception.

And:

As the scientists were experimenting in their laboratories, practical 
tradesmen were making themselves permanent standards. In 1793, during 
Napoleon's time, the French government adopted a new system of standards 
called the metric system, based on what they called the metre.
