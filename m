There is no via sound maintainer...  I used to do it, but have long
since lost Via hardware needed to adequately support it.  Further, ALSA
will go into 2.5.x sometime (hopefully), and they support Via audio...

I can answer questions but it's really not much more than what you see
in the datasheet.
