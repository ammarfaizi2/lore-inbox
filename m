So...let me see if I understand this correctly...

When the US President vacates office to make room for his successor, he
can then be prosecuted for "otherwise trafficing" in a "service" that
"has only limited commercial significance or purpose...other than to
circumvent a technological measure..." because AS A PART OF HIS JOB as
President, he received information from his advisors relating to matters
of national security, but is now legally barred from knowing that
information by this act?

That should be fun to watch...

Best wishes from Riley.
