Open source + Linux + DRM could be used to solve the Quake client-side 
cheating problem:

   http://catb.org/~esr/writings/quake-cheats.html

To join a game, you'd have to be able to prove you're running code that is 
secure all the way from boot to reboot, where everything from network driver 
to physics engine is known to be compiled from open source that all 
participants agree is good.  You could call this a "white hat" use of DRM.  
It's strictly voluntary and nothing mysterious takes over your computer - no 
spyware, no trojans.  Just Linux, drivers, and the game.

Granted, this is a pretty theoretical application.  Just because of the sheer 
amount of work needed to put all the pieces in in place, DRM will actually be 
used a lot more for what is really easy: trampling on fair use rights.  But 
it's not like fair use isn't already being trampled upon, without the aid of 
DRM.

The point of this is that, to be maximally effective, DRM wants to be coupled 
with open source: with just DRM and no open source, there's no way to achieve 
the same level of trust.  So there is a silver lining, even in this rotten, 
stinking cloud.

Regards,

Daniel
