Would you want to live in a world where 1 litre milk was either more or  
less than 1 litre water?

Why, then, do you think it was *ever* "good enough"?

I certainly never thought that 1 GB disk being a different number of  
usable bits than 1 GB RAM was ever "good enough". *I* considered that to  
be plain old fraud.

"Established practice" is that these prefixes are decimal. It has been  
established practice before the first electronic computer was even built.

I see it as an unequivocal improvement, even though I don't like the  
actual choice of prefix. But then, I never liked "Exa" or "Peta" either
