A/DeMuDi is based on  a sarge  snapshot (currently  17 July.. time  to
shift  forward!), plus some bits of  sid  (especially up to date audio
packages).

Which kernel tree are you using?

Have you built your kernel starting from the stock kernel-source-2.6.8
package along with the relevant debian patch?
