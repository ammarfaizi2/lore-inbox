I noticed 4 out of 5 LKML web archives listed in the FAQ
are down as of today.

They are listed in the LKML FAQ at http://www.tux.org/lkml/ :

1. http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/index.html
   this is the only on that works for me. It is missing most of
   todays messages. I guess is is not updated in real time.

2. http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/
   This one is inaccessible for several days.
   ( gives a connection timeout )

3. http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel
  The site says :
 Due to another 3Ware-driver-related system crash, marc.theaimsgroup.com and lists.kde.org are down.

4. http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/
   Inaccessible site.
   ( gives a connection timeout )

5. http://web.gnu.walfield.org/mail-archive/linux-kernel
   The site responds , but is empty. There are no messages archived.

Conspiracy theories ?
