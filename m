I'm not trying to make my patches IA64 specific, and my patch is quite
machine independent.  However, some of them, such as placing mem_map at
boot time or hotplug events, are machine dependent by nature.

I'm afraid that the memsection thing is overkill for systems whose
hotpluggable memory unit is large.  I understand there's need for
memsection, but I think that should be optional.

BTW, I think memory hotplugging on 32 bit archs are difficult because
of their narrow address space.  For example:
	1. A system boots with 1GB * 4 blocks of RAM.
	2. The second RAM block is removed.
	3. A 2GB block is inserted in the second slot.
Where does these RAM block appear in physical space, and where should
their mem_map be placed?
