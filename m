using 2.4.16 and RH7.2 with ext3 and wondering how to speed tings up...

i read somewhere.. can't recall where now..that making the change to only
journal what larger metadata?? speeds things up??

i guess idea is that journaling slows FS down 50% in some areas.

feel free to email me privately especially if its already been covered..i
did search at archives for meta and couldn't find sorry.........

thx
lee
