	Probably not, but it would be interesting to consider the 
possibilities: what if someone with good memory went and looked at the 
source code, picked it apart, memorized how it *worked* (and not actual
code), then told someone else how it worked and that person then implemented
it in another OS (say, Linux modules).  I've heard of this scheme being
used before to get around NDA's and other legalities.  It might be worth
a try.
