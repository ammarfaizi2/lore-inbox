The email you just sent to one of
our users was refused because
he/she does not want to receive
attachments/postcards.

This can be for a variety of reasons
but the most common ones are that
they are likely offended by pictures
sent to them in this manner or because
they are afraid of viruses. We suggest
you start off with text only messages
until you know the person well enough
to exchange pictures. If you did not
send an attachment then we suggest you
break up your email into smaller portions,
the limit is 5000 characters before the
mail gets refused in this manner.

  best regards,

   your friendly censor :)
