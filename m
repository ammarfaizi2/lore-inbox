you mean presto_permission(), and yes, so that can be removed

incomplete, not broken ...

	 - jfs_permission()
	  - can_get_xattr()
	   '- __jfs_getxattr()
	     - jfs_get_acl()
	      - jfs_acl_chmod()
	       '- jfs_setattr()
	       
	      - jfs_init_acl()
	       - jfs_create()
	       - jfs_mkdir()
	       - jfs_mknod()
	       '- jfs_symlink()
	       
	      '-= jfs_permission()
	      
	     '- jfs_getxattr()
	     
	  '- can_set_xattr()
	    '- __jfs_setxattr()
	      - jfs_removexattr()
	      - jfs_set_acl()
	       -= jfs_acl_chmod()
	       '-= jfs_init_acl()
	       
	      '- jfs_setxattr()


the xattr struff needs attention anyway, and many
of the functions calling jfs_permission() directly or
indirectly will have the check at a higher layer ...

	 - vfs_permission()
	  - hfs_permission()
	  - hfsplus_permission()
	  - nfs_permission()
	  -* permission()
	  - presto_permission()
	  '- proc_permission()

please elaborate ...

okay, but why not do it in permission(), and make
the few callers of vfs_permission use that one instead?

except for jfs_permission() and nfsd_permission()
(which is hell enough) there are no direct calls
of *_permission() ...

hmm, obviously you didn't read the patch at all, as that 
is exactly what I did, so please have a look at it ...

I don't see why, please enlighten me ...

hmm, well but how would moving the ro checks around
or adding them for the vfs mounts influence that?

I agree that this _is_ an issue but why should this _not_
happen with mount -o remount,ro /xy ?

best,
