This is getting funnier by the day!

Even the word 'normal' is a religious term.  It literally means to be a 
good Christian - a Gentleman.  Christian seminaries are 'Normal Schools' 
and have 'Normal Classes'.  Yes, there was a time when I was forced to 
attend 'Normal Class' - it didn't help - I became a heathen...

Maybe we should switch to Zen Buddist terminology instead, it is less 
violent.

For what it is worth, I grew up with the software term 'normalize'. 
'Canonize' seems a bit too strong for my tase.
