Just follow the money trail if you want to know what agreements are
in place. The OSDL funding process is open if you look a the membership
levels and the required funding. 
	http://groups.osdl.org/join/membership_levels
As a non-profit OSDL is under close scrutiny by IRS and the member companies.
There are non hidden agenda deals here.

Companies with direct sales to end-users are always making partner
arrangements; that is the nature of business. But like teenagers the
romances don't always last long, and someone usually gets dropped.
