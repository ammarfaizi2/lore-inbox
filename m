The nearest way to glory is to strive to be what you wish to be thought to be.

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
A life is like a tree -- if you don't make it straight when its young and green, you'll never do it when it's old and dry.There are four things every person has more of than they know sins, debt, years, and foes.
