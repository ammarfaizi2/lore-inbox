There is a driver for the 2.4 series kernel available to download... and 
googling, and searching various archives, I see that noone has done any ports 
for 2.6 series kernels. has anyone on list done it?
I dont know enough about kernel programming to attempt it :/
or, is this controller supported in another driver?
