I agree entirely that Linus, as creator of the license, is
privileged with respect to interpretation of the license.  I
disagree however with your suggestion that he is privileged with
respect to the copyright (eg the ability to sue or relicense),
especially since his own words (cited earlier) read like a
disclaimer of such privilege.

I basically support your position.
