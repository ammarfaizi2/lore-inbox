In my opinion, what is here is nothing more than information that most 
likely does not contain anything that would violate the BK license. The 
check-in comments could easily have been take from the bkbits site 
and put into HTML code, and there is a gzipped patch that could simply 
be gotten through use of BK. Larry, if I'm wrong about any of this, please
 feel free to tell me.
