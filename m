Hi, all interested people. If you guys are really interested in getting this
to work and make this happen, we might make a mailing list, so we don't
bother LKML and Linux-Thinkpad.

Feel free to contact IBM to ask them to please release the driver or spec
for this. Look at the links below.

It won't take you 3 minutes. :-)
