This is all very well, but is this not something that might change if
someone else were to come into control of the company? It isn't hard to
imagine some future BitMover CEO with a more Microsoft-like mentality
looking at the product and thinking, "This 'ease of getting data out'
has to go -- we need to make it less convenient for our customers to
defect."

It is a general problem with power that you have to worry not just about
whether those who currently wield it will abuse it, but also their
successors.
