Ok.

It is done by scripts using list of files generated by git-diff, but I
can reformat them to be in a way:
core files
poll/select
timer
any other
main Kconfig/Makefile

Kevent's makefile still contains all entries for files added later, is
it a big problem right now?
I can split patches manually, but it would be much better to do it when
decision about it's inclusion is made, and until review and feature
addiotion process is not completed generate patches as is...
