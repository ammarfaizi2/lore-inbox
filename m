If I use some GPL'd code and make calls from my software to the GPL'd
code, do I need to make *my* code available?  Or would I only have to
make available any changes to the GPL'd code?

Section 2.b of the GPL seems to indicate that I need to make the source
for my entire executable available if it incorporates any GPL'd source,
and that I cannot charge for the software, only for its distribution. 
Is this correct?

Thanks,
Chris
