I share some of your sentiment, but honestly, think about it.

Linus has to "keep up" with all the changees coming into his inbox as
well, and the more features, the more breakage that can happen when
Linus accepts a patch.

Really, Linus wants to push some of his maintanance overhead to distros,
who get paid to do it, but also to provide sexy bullet point items for
users, so they buy "Linux" stuff.

You try to find a better balance.
