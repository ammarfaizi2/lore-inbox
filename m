   Can you list what cards/systems use this driver?  I at least am totally
   unsure.

I can't tell you much more than the list of PCI device IDs and those
are contained in the driver sources.

The first two cards I have for testing are 3COM copper gigabit cards
but I have no idea what the official model numbers are for these as
they came with no packaging.
