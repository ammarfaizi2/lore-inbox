I rechecked the driver code and found that it should be irrelevant
with the spinlock period.

The driver checks the start time via do_gettimeofday(), then sleeps
50ms via msleep(50), wakes up, checks the current DMA position by
reading a register and then marks the end time vai do_gettimeofday()
again.  The clock speed is computed from the period time between two
time marks and from the DMA position.
Both the DMA-position-reading and do_gettimeofday call are protected
in the same spinlock, so there shouldn't be so much delay between
them.  And even if there were, the calculate rate would be bigger, not
smaller.

So, the problem is either:
- DMA position is reported wrongly, or
- do_gettimeofday() returns inaccurate time

A puzzling thing is that the period time measured is 50992 usecs, so
it looks correct.  Assume that the DMA register is correct, another
theory is that the whole time on the system goes faster at this stage,
and both jiffies and gettimeofday() are inaccurate.

Anyway, I feel that we can skip this check for ICH4 and later
machines.  I don't know of any devices with non-48k clock on recent
boards, and we can save a bit boot time by skipping this measurement.
