Greetings Bartlomiej,

It is time for you to step up to the plate!

As many people know, Bartlomiej is someone whom I trust with the driver
without reservations.  Since I am off working on several other issues, I
would request the Maintainership be dual duty split over all kernel
versions regardless.  I am hoping Bartlomiej will accept the shared task
and everyone will accept his input without question, this includes me too.

I will still be around and active; however, the task is so large now it
truly does require a team.  Please sign up to help Bart.

Cheers,

Andre Hedrick
