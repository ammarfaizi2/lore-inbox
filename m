Well, no one's using your patch except the entire Linux sound/music
community :-) the people around the linux-audio-user mailing list, the
users of the PlanetCCRMA distro, etc.
I suspect also that the video guys are also quite familiar with your
work, at least those who do a lot of analog video capture (and maybe
digital as well).
