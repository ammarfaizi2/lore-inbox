In the past I have only done patches against the 2.6.x kernels. I'm
thinking, however, of requesting space on kernel.org for patches against
-rcX and -mm kernels. You're the second person to ask. If I get asked
some more, I might do it :> (It's not that it's hard, just that it takes
time and today is my last day working on the code full time).

The best way to answer that is to point to
http://swsusp.sourceforge.net/features.html.
