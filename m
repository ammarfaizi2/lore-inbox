As interesting and informative as this is, maybe there needs to be a
mailing list (linux-politics-discuss?) or something to serve as an
appropriate outlet for these kinds of discussions (as well as bitkeeper
licensing issues, C++ modules, etc.). It's a bit difficult to
appreciate the relevance of this kind of "political" message to a list
dedicated to kernel programming and cold, hard code.

Congratulations on your new directions and position. I hope there will
soon be a place for which your informative announcements are more
appropriate than linux-kernel.
