FYI, I tried 2.9.10-rc3 kernel, same problem.

Can anyone guide me or give me some pointers how I can enable
login on serial ports - that would hopefully allow me to capture
more/longer kernal panic screens. Doing an rlogin doesn't help,
the kernel panic is still going to the root console (24 lines
visible).

Any other tips/pointers as to how to capture kernel panics or
what else I can do to help you guys to help me would be highly
appreciated. :*)

Kind Regards,
rudi
