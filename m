   All I am asking is that someone lets me know if they make major
   changes to my code so I can keep track of whats happening.

We have not made any major changes to your code, in lieu of this
not being code which is actually being submitted yet.

If it bothers you that publicly someone has published changes to your
driver which you disagree with, oh well... :-)

This "please check things out" phase is precisely what you are
asking of us, it is how we are saying "here is what we need to
do with your driver, please comment".

Later,
