I was thinking about a news in LWN.
I've made a search on it and finally found the news :

http://lwn.net/2000/0427/devel.phtml#devel
Browsers and Mail support

TradeClient 0.2beta released. Bynari International has announced the final
pre-release of its TradeClient email client and personal information
manager. Tradeclient is aimed at people accustomed to or currently using
Microsoft Exchange. TradeClient is released under the LGPL. Note that a
proprietary product, Bynari TradeXCH, is required in order to connect
Tradeclient to Microsoft Exchange.

Apparently the project is now open source and hosted by sourceforge:
http://tradeclient.sourceforge.net/

I'm not sure that it was not a PR "à la Microsoft".

Friendly,
Christophe
