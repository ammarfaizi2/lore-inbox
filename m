I used to run mm. I don't submit bug reports because i'm lazy
;-).
Now i don't run it because 2.6 doesn't look very usable and i
 don't want to test two development versions. Also sometimes is 
handy to have a stable version around when something goes wrong
(i.e. filesystem corruption after a crash or power failure).

I had my filesystem trashed with 2.6 so i'm more carefull now.
