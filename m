I've now updated the framebuffer driver list and hopefully listed each
current driver. It may not show the correct name so please suggest corrections.

For each driver its maintainer should be listed possibly with its
sourceforge.net user account in brackets. I'd like if only current
maintainers, who really take care of their drivers, are listed and none
who has done so in the past. Please any maintainer post a message to
linux-fbdev-devel or tell me where I can retrieve reliable information.

I'd like to form a QA team which task is mostly to take care of not
maintained drivers. If you want to volunteer just leave me a message.

O. Wyss
