No, I wasn't aware of that group.  Here are the ones I did know about:
	- IBM (intel and power processor based)
	- Intel
	- Fujitsu

It sounds like there are others out there too.

I also was just pointed at the mailing list at:
	http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=223
which is for Linux hotplug memory stuff and has been around for years.
I also wasn't aware of it (and neither were the IBM people who asked me
to create this new list.)

So everyone go and join the lhms-devel list instead, I'll go and
shutdown the linux-hotplug-memory list as it doesn't really need to be
created.

Sorry for the noise...
