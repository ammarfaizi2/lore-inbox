        Obviously, since as the number of CPUs grow, you begin
experiencing the bottleneck of shared resources (bus, memory, I/O,
etc.) multiplexing. For a large number of processors, the performance
becomes very far from linear, i.e. the gain obtained from an extra CPU
becomes very minute. That's why massively parallel computers tend to
use separate motherboards for each CPU.

        BTW, I have a question: Can the availability of dual-CPU
boards for intel and amd processors, rather then tri- or quadra-CPU
boards, be explained with the fact that the performance degrades
significantly for three or more CPUs? Or is there a technological
and/or comercial reason behind? I heard somewhere that the intel holds
some patents related with many-CPU boards...

        Cheers,
