This is my (slightly) late push of patches that I've had hanging around in
my ARM tree for a while.  Feel free to pick any of them up.

* 2.5.29-keyboard
  2.5.29-pci
+ 2.5.29-rdunzip
* 2.5.43-bug
+ 2.5.43-menuconfig
* 2.5.43-tick

The patches marked with '+' have been sent to Linus in addition to LKML.
Patches marked with '*' will be sent to Linus tomorrow; please comment
on them.  Two of them have been sent to the list twice before.

Thanks.
