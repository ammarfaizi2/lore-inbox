patch updated, thanks.

From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>

Add a chapter on typedefs, based on an email from Linus
to lkml on Feb. 3, 2006:
(Subject: Re: [RFC][PATCH 1/5] Virtualization/containers: startup)
with added lkml feedback, esp. David Woodhouse.

+
+Please don't use things like "vps_t".
+
+It's a _mistake_ to use typedef for structures and pointers. When you see a
+
+	vps_t a;
+
+in the source, what does it mean?
+
+In contrast, if it says
+
+	struct virtual_container *a;
+
+you can actually tell what "a" is.
+
+Lots of people think that typedefs "help readability". Not so. They are
+useful only for:
+
+ (a) totally opaque objects (where the typedef is actively used to _hide_
+     what the object is).
+
+     Example: "pte_t" etc. opaque objects that you can only access using
+     the proper accessor functions.
+
+     NOTE! Opaqueness and "accessor functions" are not good in themselves.
+     The reason we have them for things like pte_t etc. is that there
+     really is absolutely _zero_ portably accessible information there.
+
+ (b) Clear integer types, where the abstraction _helps_ avoid confusion
+     whether it is "int" or "long".
+
+     u8/u16/u32 are perfectly fine typedefs, although they fit into
+     category (d) better than here.
+
+     NOTE! Again - there needs to be a _reason_ for this. If something is
+     "unsigned long", then there's no reason to do
+
+	typedef unsigned long myflags_t;
+
+     but if there is a clear reason for why it under certain circumstances
+     might be an "unsigned int" and under other configurations might be
+     "unsigned long", then by all means go ahead and use a typedef.
+
+ (c) when you use sparse to literally create a _new_ type for
+     type-checking.
+
+ (d) New types which are identical to standard C99 types, in certain
+     exceptional circumstances.
+
+     Although it would only take a short amount of time for the eyes and
+     brain to become accustomed to the standard types like 'uint32_t',
+     some people object to their use anyway.
+
+     Therefore, the Linux-specific 'u8/u16/u32/u64' types and their
+     signed equivalents which are identical to standard types are
+     permitted -- although they are not mandatory in new code of your
+     own.
+
+     When editing existing code which already uses one or the other set
+     of types, you should conform to the existing choices in that code.
+
+ (e) Types safe for use in userspace.
+
+     In certain structures which are visible to userspace, we cannot
+     require C99 types and cannot use the 'u32' form above. Thus, we
+     use __u32 and similar types in all structures which are shared
+     with userspace.
+
+Maybe there are other cases too, but the rule should basically be to NEVER
+EVER use a typedef unless you can clearly match one of those rules.
+
+In general, a pointer, or a struct that has elements that can reasonably
+be directly accessed should _never_ be a typedef.
