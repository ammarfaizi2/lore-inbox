Actually, sparse taught me how life was before the internet.  I had to
ask someone else to get it for me, don't want to bother him on a
regular basis and am stuck with an old version.  Not that I've done
anything with it worth giving back, but I do feel the pain.

On the other hand, if it matters enough, people will find solutions.
Would be nice, if Larry coded up something central that all projects
could benefit from, but that is not necessary.  All projects that grow
important enough will have a solution someday.

BTW: Is there a non-bk way to get recent sparse code yet?
