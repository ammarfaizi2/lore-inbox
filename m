If you want to donate money to a project(s), I'm sure that a simple email 
to the maintainer(s) of that project would get you an address to send such 
a donation to. Myself, I feel that donation should be optional, besides 
the obvious practical difficulties with something like this (e.g., the 
task of keeping track of who has paid, not to mention the necessary 
restrictions on downloading at various sites, not to mention the fact that 
people will end up just getting source and posting it for everyone, not to 
mention...)
