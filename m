Curtis, I realize your point but can you be sure that your GUID will not
grant them any legal coverage for damages caused by this garbage?  I want
everyone to have the opportunity to rip the money out of these greedy 
dirt-bags back pockets, when they end up harming the public.

Curtis, this is not directed at you or your company.

Well I want it make it REAL-CLEAR, to the CPRM bone-heads!

If Linux-OS disables CPRM and it is RE-ENABLED by the "REAL-ROGUE-JAVA" or
"LICENSED-APPLICATION-ON-THE-NET" I will file a class action lawsuit
against the drive maker, the oem, and every dirty-rotten-!@#$% that
damages linux-os and my-reputation as an os-writer.

You can bet your sweet-bippy that I will have a party because of the
destructive damage to the OS and file-systems this pile of crap will
cause in the world of business!  This has just lit the fire under me to
complete and publish the full-taskfile parser and jammer to this crap.

Curtis, this has nothing to do with your proposal.  It has everything to
do with the greedy little !@#$%^&*() that are going to violate the 
ownership rights of products and the use of those products.

I have made arrangements to speak with both of California's Senators and
seeking the audience with the Senators that sponsored DMCA and will
question their lack of foresight on the issue.  If the MPAA and SDMI can
go dork with legal issues then so can the Penguin!  I will inform them
that I have a method to destroy the functionality of CPRM without
violating the DMCA.  I will publish it without repsect for any laws passed
against me.  If I can not publish in the USA, I will publish in another
country that doesn't honor copy protection and, just as there is no way to
stop the CPRM people, there is nothing that can be done to stop me.

I will create the perfect anal-retentive-host-driver.  These CPRM
designers will not play by the rules that if a host turns off a feature
that it is to stay off, thus I will now destroy the feature by not
allowing it to be accessed.  Only because they have decided to do gross,
anti-social, and dishonorable things like you have stated (violate the
will of the HOST) they will do, is the reason that lawlessness begets
lawlessness.

Oh, against better judgement, I have included the linux-kernel-mail-list.
Just so my world will know and help protect me and Linux from the CPRM
world.

Respectfully,

Andre Hedrick
