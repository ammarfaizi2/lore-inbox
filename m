Today lilo (the FreeNode network owner) has decided to make one step away i=
n a=20
direction opposite of freedom, and banned all Tor users from the FreeNode=20
network.

Tor ( http://tor.eff.org ) is an open source anonymous gateway system. Many=
=20
users who are not in the position to be able to use IRC otherwise (such as=
=20
those who live in countries who do not believe in free speech) now cannot u=
se=20
=46reenode any longer.

Do we want to use an IRC network that no longer supports freedom? Our only=
=20
option is to move to another network, such as irc.noderebellion.net or=20
irc.oftc.net. Channels such as #kernelnewbies have already moved to oftc du=
e=20
to lilo's past actions.
