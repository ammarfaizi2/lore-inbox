Is there a way to enable the memory interleaving of modern VIA chipsets 
(Apollo Pro-133 in my case) through the Linux kernel or some other software?

>From what I understand it's done through some PCI register tweaking ..
Can it be done with setpci or code is needed ?

any info would be welcomed

thanks
