I have had a chance to make a pass over the device model documentation. 
I've removed most gross inaccuracies, though there may still be a few 
glowing warts. You can get at them at

http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mochel/doc/

The OLS paper and presentation (in Open Office format) are also there. 

Everyone is encouraged to have a look. Feel free to send me comments, 
corrections, or patches. 


Additionally, I've also exported my BK tree, which can be found at

bk://ldm.bkbits.net/linux-2.5/

Currently, the only thing committed so far is the above mentioned 
documentation and the fixing of the existing documentation.
