Greetings,

I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, so I
apologize in advance if I am causing any annoyances.

I just finished reading Robert Love's Linux Kernel Development. I now
want to get my hands dirty by doing an involved kernel project. I
would be grateful if people can give me some kernel project ideas. I
don't want to get into something which is not feasible. Thanks a lot.

P.S. I am a Junior student majoring in Computer Science, just to give
you an idea of my skill level.
