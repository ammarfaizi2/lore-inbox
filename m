the root of the problem is that not all
packages maintainers of distributions send feedback/fixes
to _origianl software writer_. And you have cases
like this. Diferents tastes from same software,
everyone with its bugs and features.

Without to go too far, there are a lot of stupid
fixes into distributions kernels not present in 2.4.21-rcX

This is a general problem, and IMHO the distributions maintainers
should send more feedback to package maintainer more frequently.

-thanks-
