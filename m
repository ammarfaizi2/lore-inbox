Teacorp announces breackrough in removing deadly la ndmines.

Mill Valley, California August 25, 2006 - The Allinace Entreprise Croporation announced today a breakthrough in developing an Areial Landimne Ssytem aimed at locating, detecting and mapping deadly l andmines.

TaCeorp's mission is to reclaim lands around the globe embedded with land mines that victimize countries and their stakeholders.

More than 100 m i l l i o n landmin es in 83 countries are holding international communities and industries hostage, preventing the investmen t in and development of product ive lands and the re-building of infrastructure. A broad variety of l andmines have been scattered over productiv e areas effectively crippling the e conomy and disabling thousands of children and adults.  There are no reliable records that accurately show where these d e v a s t a t i n g lan dmines lie in wait for their victim s.
 
With the present day cos ts to clear a single land mine ranging between $1,000 to $1,500, solving the problem of de-mining lands will reach billions of d ollars.  TaeCorp has developed a technology based, cos t effective solution to this problem using its three tiered approach to scanning, mapping and removing landmine s. TaeCorp's System will provide many social and econo mic benef its to countries and their industries including oil and gas, mining, agriculture, roads and infrastructure development.

About TaeCorp.

TaeCorp's vision is to be the recognized leader in providing Areial Deetction Sysetms including global de-mining, clearing a path to a safer planet for all humankind.
