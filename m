	I think you are correct here.  I seem to recall mention of some
of those earlier devices at the time of the Microsoft announcement.  I
seem to also recall some of the reliability problem they had.  I believe
they were extremely fussy about the surface they were on.

	I would agree there.  They did something to improve the reliability
on a wider variety of surface textures, though.  Is that innovation or
merely getting a good idea, that's been around, to finally work?  Don't
know.  I didn't find the idea itself particularly innovative.  The fact
that they did get it to work reliable is something to be said.

	The marketing is a given, of course.  Particularly in the face
of the preception in some camps that this style of optical mouse was
unreliable.

	Agreed.
