Well I've removed it actually because Artem said he didn't need it
anymore.

However, if you can provide an implementation of pcompress for deflate
that's generic enough then I'm happy to put it back.  By genericity
I mean not making assumptions such as the input buffer size being
less than 4K.

Something liks this will be included once we have async crypto.  However,
that could be a while yet so I suggest that you start by including the
deflate implementation in user-space.
