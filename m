Dear. Sir/Madam



I am Mrs Jewel. Howard Taylor wife to the 
Liberian president Charles Ghankay Taylor.  

I am contacting you with the hope that you will be 
Of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of 30 Million U.S dollars cash, 
which I intend to use for investment purposes.
This money came as a result of a contract deal between my husband and a Russian firm in our country's multi-billion dollar, Diamonds sales mid last 
Year for some undisclosed goods supply to the Government of Liberia. For some Reasons the supply was called off.On June 6, 2003, 
The Special Court For Sierra Leone published the 
Indictment and Warrant of Arrest of my husband President, Charles Taylor of Liberia for War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. In the Indictment my 
Husband Charles Taylor was charged with:"...engage[in] in notorious or Widespread, and systematic attacks against the civilian population of Sierra Leone" and that 
"At all times relevant to this Indictment,that my husband Charles Ghankay Taylor supported And encouraged all actions of the RUF and AFRC/RUF 
alliance and acted in concert with Foday Saybana Sankph and other leaders of the RUF AAFRC/RUF"
The warrant of Arrest appealed to all national authorities, international 
and INTERPOL to take all necessary actions to have President Charles Taylor arrested and turned over to the Special Court For Sierra Leone. 
The warrant also appealed to all nations to:
"...identify and locate assets owned by the accused [Charles Taylor] 
located within the territory of any state and adopt provisional measures to freeze such assets without prejudice to the rights of third parties..."
The publication of the indictment and warrant of arrest triggered panic and sent shock waves throughout Liberia, while Taylor was in Ghana to attend 
peace talks between rebel groups and his Government.

In the wake of this political earthquake, President Taylor abandoned the peace talks and 
Immediately departed for Liberia without being arrested by the Ghanaian Government.
In view of all this I acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of Our finance houses before it was burgled. 
And have deposited the money in two Security companies here in Ghana and Nigeria,Were we are currently staying on exile(with a coded name) as family treasure in. 
Two trunks with the help of very loyal officials of my husband. 
No record is known about this fund by the government house, because there is no documentation showing that we received such funds. 
"Due to the current situation of things in my country today and the Attacks on my husband's government by various government's And the rebels, we are closely monitored and I cannot talk to you now or 
make use of this money hence". 
I seek your help in receiving these funds and pay into your account on trust for the family's safety. 
Bearing in mind that you may and will assist me, 
In my quest to invest part of these funds Abroad for the family’s. Up keep now.
While I arrange my families relocation to meet you as soon as we are through with the transfer. 
l have decided to part with 20% to you,
as my personal adviser,
Barr Michael Addo. 
has been mandated to handle this entire matter with you. 
Therefore feel free to contact him at 
{addomike@msn.com}

for more clarification and further discussions. 
Please be guided, as all correspondence should be directed to my lawyer. 

 Sincerely, 

Dr. Jewel Howard-Taylor
