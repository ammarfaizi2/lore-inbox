Nonesense. If the business no longer has the licence to use BK (for
whatever reason) then it no longer has access to the data. Now to
get access to the data you must reverse engineer BK...

Even though the data is still ASCII, the interrelationships between the
parts of the data is still "data". And extracting/viewing that would
require the reverse enginnering.
