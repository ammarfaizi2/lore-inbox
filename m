Are you one of those people who say X11 sucks? And whole idea of a
neworked gui sucks? Like ones who threaten to rewrite entire gui without
planning, in OpenGL and use the rest of the energy tarishing X?
Well, if it is done, probably you won't have to compile those extensions
in anyway, so what's the whining about? Enterprise level features will
let linux run on Mainframes not in pitiful x86 emulation mode, with hot
swappable hardware. Just like raid. Would you say RAID sucks a** and
weighs down linux, because it is an enterprise feature? By the tone of
your voice it seems so.
I am for a concious featurism, add features as long as others are stable
and fixed(not in MS way)
