This is my first email to the list. I'm not subscribed but I've read it
for years.

I don't agree with those claiming that 2.4.xx is bad or still beta.

We the administrators have the responsability to test early kernels and
send  good bug reports so the developers can solve the bugs. That's the
way we can contribute to the community.

But it's really risky to use these kernels on MAIN 24x7  production
servers.

This has been true for 1.2.x  2.0.x  (I think that was the best linux
kernel series) 2.2.x and 2.4.x and will be for 2.6.x also

Given we know that the support  from open source developers is clearly
better than commercial contract supports, I don't see the reason to
complain about the work of those wonderfull hackers spending their spare
time coding for all of us.
