OK, we've established that then.

  1) It would be equally as useful as a URL
  2) It would not consume download bandwidth
  3) It would show some sensitivity to the concerns of those who are
     uncomfortable with the license.

I really don't see how changing out the files for a url qualifies as
the "worst way" of addressing the issue.  If Larry unretracts his offer
to host the files - and I fully expect he will do that after some period
of indulging in his wounded bird act - then by definition the documentation
will always be available exactly when and where needed.  Is there *anybody*
here who'd have further license-related complaints about Bitkeeper if that
were done?  (Speak or forever hold your peace.)
