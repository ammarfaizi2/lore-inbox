Hello Andrew,

- test2-mm2 :  pppd starts ok (i use & follow 2.5.x & 2.6-test branch 
since ~2.5.40 .... 2.5.72-mm2 was ok for instance)
- test2-mm3-1 : pppd does not start, kobject badness trace, full traces 
in my last email and parts above :

- test2-mm4 : pppd does not start, same kobject badness trace.

All kernel compiled with gcc version 3.3.1 20030728 (Debian prerelease), 
mm3-1 was compiled after a make mrproper
.config is attached.



PS : the badness "error" is maybe a consequence of the real problem 
(cleanup action)... if you can point me some medium state between mm2 & 
mm3-1 i will do the tests.

I hope this helps,

Great Regards,
Florent
