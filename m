We rebooted to unwedge some VM problems (we really need to upgrade to
Rik's rmap stuff, it's better that 2.4.5, that's for sure).  Unfortunately,
it's been so long since we rebooted that the drives are being checked and
there are several million inodes so it's taking a while.  Maybe another 
half hour.
