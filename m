Paula Begoun´s take on StriVectin-SD (from latest newsletter) >>>   ( ) 
StriVectin-SD: Better than Botox?

Quite a few of you have written asking about the rather prominent newspaper ads for the product StriVectin-SD ($135 for 6 ounces). With a headline that reads "Better than Botox," along with the increasing number of topical products hitting the market claiming they can mimic the effects of Botox without "painful injections," I certainly understand the curiosity. 

I wrote about StriVectin-SD in a previous newsletter, when a reader asked about its ability to repair stretch marks. That was StriVectin's original marketing claim to fame, though the fame was all self-promoted, as there is not a single independent, peer-reviewed study to prove that StriVectin is an effective option for repairing stretch marks. The studies that do exist about StriVectin's benefits for stretch marks were paid for by Klein-Becker, the company that distributes StriVectin. 

According to the company's latest ads, they were surprised to find that not only was StriVectin-SD getting rid of women's stretch marks, but also that somehow their facial wrinkles were going away, too. For that reason, we now have the astounding "anti-wrinkle breakthrough of the decade." Regrettably, no supportive research needs to be available to sell this kind of hyperbole. All it takes is to promise women that a product will get rid of their wrinkles and they will buy it in droves, no matter how many other product lines, infomercials, advertisements, or cosmetics salespeople pledge the exact same thing. 

StriVectin's ad continues with "The active formula in StriVectin-SD has recently been shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce that category of fine lines and facial wrinkles that can add 10–15 years to your appearance...and even reduce the dark circles under your eyes...without irritation, painful injections, or surgery." One more flourish is the statement that "in fact, [StriVectin-SD] is the only topical formulation clinically proven to effectively confront every aspect of wrinkle reduction." It is easy to debunk all of this overblown nonsense by pointing out the product's lack of sunscreen; perhaps StriVectin overlooked the research about sun exposure's deleterious, wrinkling, and discoloring effects on skin. 

Klein-Becker has parlayed these claims into what appears to be little more than an effort to spin off the popularity of Botox to its own benefit. StriVectin-SD is supposedly preferred because its long-term results versus the short-term results (and repeated treatments) of Botox. A Dr. Nathalie Chevreau is quoted in the ad, saying "the cumulative effects of using a product like StriVectin become more noticeable every day, and ultimately last longer than Botox." Chevreau is hardly an impartial source, as she works for Klein-Becker. Further, Dr. Chevreau is a licensed dietician in Utah, a fact that is conveniently left out of StriVectin's ad because it would conflict with her credibility as a medical doctor speaking about the legitimate benefits of an antiwrinkle cream. 

The final Botox comparison comes from the ad's statement that StriVectin not only addresses the _expression lines Botox treats, but also the lines Botox doesn't affect. However, the only lines Botox wouldn't affect are the ones not injected. 

Needless to say, Klein-Becker's statements comparing StriVectin-SD to Botox have not gone unnoticed by Allergan, the company that manufactures the drug. According to an article in The Salt Lake Tribune, Allergan has threatened to sue Klein-Becker for false advertising and unfair business practices. After the tension continued to mount on both sides, Klein-Becker actually went ahead and took the case to court, asking a federal judge to approve its advertising for StriVectin-SD. As this newsletter goes to press, Klein-Becker has not taken their lawsuit any further. 

In the meantime, the "Better than Botox" ads remain in wide circulation and are sent via spam emails, and StriVectin-SD is now available at Nordstrom department stores. 

So is StriVectin better than Botox? The short answer is no--and that means no way, and nohow. It isn't even better than the daily use of an effective sunscreen! StriVectin is merely a moisturizer with some good emollients and antioxidants, though the addition of peppermint oil is extremely suspect--the tingle is probably meant to lead women to believe that the product is doing something to their skin. Botox prevents the use of facial muscles, and that instantaneously smoothes out the skin. StriVectin-SD won't alter the wrinkling on any part of your face, not in the long term, and not in the short term. 

Incidentally, the two studies quoted in StriVectin's ads for "Better than Botox" were supposedly from information presented at the 20th World Congress of Dermatology, held in July 2002. These examined the effects of palmitoyl pentapeptide-3 (trade name: Matrixyl, but also known as Pal-KTTKS, which is the term used in StriVectin's ads) and compared it to vitamin C and retinol. However, there is no published research substantiating the results, and StriVectin declined to send us any documentation. 



Zantrex Zantrex-3

Zantrex 3 side effects are identical to those associated with excessive caffeine consumption (Zantrex is primarily marketed as a "proprietary xanthine-based stimulant", but xanthine is simply caffeine). You may be interested to know that one serving of Zantrex 3 will provide you with more caffeine than you'd obtain from 3 cups of coffee -- so caffeine-related side effects may be quite prominent in some people. 
It's also important to note that caffeine has many of the side-effects associated with ephedra (nervousness, increased blood pressure, heart palpitations, and so on) and although common in many foods (coffee, chocolate, various soft drinks, etc., etc.) may not be for everyone. It's also possible that because of its high caffeine content, you may experience withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking Zantrex 3. 

 

3. The Fraud.


They hire a slick marketing team (Mitchell k. Friedlander and Micheal Meade) Both already found guilty in two other states of the same type of fraud.

4. The Tyrants.

Dennis Gay, Evan Bybee, and Dr Dan Mowrey have been so mean and nasty in their growth and greed it was not hard to find employees and ex-employees that were willing to talk. I have talked to at least ten and have a list of 30 more to follow up on in my next report.. So far it is all the same story,. The owners are "scumbags" and threaten to file suit against any employee or entity that comes near them. They have filed tons of lawsuits so they now have some teeth. Money will do that.

Below is a small list of what employees and ex employees have said about the companies.

1b. Routine for them to change labels on a product instead of changing the product for sale or export. Thailand was the example..

2b. Not paying employees agreed upon pay or bonuses. (Several have taken company to labor board.)

3b. Constant threats to employees for talking about the company’s shady business practices.

4b.Many allegations of tax evasion and hidden pay packages to management. Apparently also paying Mitch Friedlander in may "exotic" ways like paying his friends, Dog, Mother and paying for his unreported living expenses, Lexus ,penthouse apartment through APRL and paying him as a consultant even after more than four years.

5b. Selling products under false or with misleading representations and wild and false marketing practices. (Example is Strivectin stretch mark cream the is now a miracle wrinkle cream.

6b. Firing anyone who knows too much or ask questions about finance dept practices.

7b. Firing employees after the employee discover illegal workers in the company and then keeping the illegal workers.

6b. Dennis Gay Family members working at the company are out of control and unbearable to work with.

7b.Company owners talking about how devious they are and what they can do to screw with people in front of employees.

8b. Using other companies names like Nordstroms to lend themselves credibility in the market place and example is placing the Nordstroms name on http://www.basicresearch.org

9b. Systematic effort to hide their identities through holding companies or secret domain registrars. (Domains by Proxy http://www.domainsbyproxy.com/ ) and others.

10b. False or broken promises of company stock to employees and potential partners and even cousins of Dennis Gay.

11b. Un-paid vendors or terms stretched to the point of settlement. 

12b. Price fixing, Threats and actions against any distributors who do not sell products at the set price. best example is Strivectin at 135 dollars. 

13b. Employees leaving the company solely for ethical reasons

14b. Accusations of Evan Bybee entering into the offices of Tree house marketing group after hours and after they ended their marketing relationship.

15b. Boiler room sales tactics. about 100 of the employees at the family of fraud companies are telemarketers.

16b. Current investigations by the FDA FTC IRS and The Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Attorney Generals office. 

Below is an exact statement from a former employee.

http://www.ripoffreport.com/report54520.htm

 "There are countless companies who have worked with Basic Research that have NEVER been paid.
 I cannot say enough about this company. Basic Research has been ripping people off for over 10 years. As a former employee, I know!!! The are wiley and sue everyone they come in contact with. I will never do business with them again. they claim to have a good reputation in the industry. Like Hell. The people who know, know these guys are scum. Especially the owners Dennis Gay, Evan Bybee and Dr. Morey. There are very few manufacturers and individuals they have not ripped off. No matter what you hear about this company if it is good, DO NOT BELIeVE IT. Maybe you could ask them to tell you how they pay Mitch. He is their director of marketing and just happens to be a convicted felon. No wonder they pay his dog and his wife to hide from the IRS. There are hundreds if not thousands of individuals who would like to see this company go down by the throat. I hear they are in Bankruptcy anyway and will probably go to Jail for Tax Evasion. There are countless companies who have worked with Basic Research that have NEVER been paid, and we are talking about 100's of thousands of dollars here. They rip you off and then say "go ahead and sue us" well I hope someone does. Get this, In GNC there is a sign in the back room from Basic Research that says "if anyone returns one of their products to get their name address copy of the drivers license and social security number and so Basic Research can sue you." Yes they sue customers who return their products. What a joke of a company. Class act these guys are. If I were you I would run like hell if you see their name on a product. Because they do not work and if you return it, they will sue you. And they act under many different names because they hide what they do. Please research this company and take them down! You will make 10,000 people happier than you could ever imagine."
