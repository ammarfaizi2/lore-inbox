The preamble to devices.txt states:

 "THE DEVICE REGISTRY IS OFFICIALLY FROZEN FOR LINUS TORVALDS' KERNEL
 TREE.  At Linus' request, no more allocations will be made official
 for Linus' kernel tree; the 3 June 2001 version of this list is the
 official final version of this registry.  At Alan Cox' request,
 however, the registry will continue to be maintained for the -ac
 series of kernels, and registrations will be accepted."

  However, a series of additions to devices.txt has just been made 
by ChangeSet 1.1769.

1) Should the statement quoted above regarding a "freeze"
   therefore be amended, eliminated or left in place?

2) What is the current mechanism for obtaining an assignment?
