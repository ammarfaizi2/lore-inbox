I nominated Edsger Wybe Dijkstra and feel this is the
best choice for a number of reasons:

	* He's good at concurrency.

	* Would bring a high academic profile to Linux.

	* Good programming practices would be enforced.
	  We'd take a year off to remove all of our
	  goto's and rewrite the kernel in Pascal.

	* Enforcement of non-anthropomorphic discussion
	  of computers and programs.

	* No one can pronounce his name properly, thus
	  preventing the complacency that would come
	  with a leader named "Smyth" or "Jones".
