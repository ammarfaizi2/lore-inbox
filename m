Sorry for the off topic question, but if you've read this far, maybe you can
give me some suggestions?

So, we are sitting on a Quad 800 Itanium here with 16gb of RAM, and
wondering just what to do with it.  Is there anyone using these in any type
of machines for any production level work? If so, what are you doing with
them?

Here's our dilemma.  Unfortunately, we rely on "other" os and database
software to power the site, that just doesn't have stable 64bit equivalents
yet, if you know who I am referring too.  I may be able to acquire the
machine to load Linux on it, and see what I can do with it for testing.
>From our work perspective, I can't think of much to push through it.  Seems
a bit much for a mail server :o)

Thanks for your time,
Bruce H.
