Exactly...
So now its justified that there SHOULD be such a thing, and it SHOULD be
WITHING THE KERNEL SOURCES because so many people will be using it and
we don't want so many patched kernels do we?
So now that there SHOULD be sucha thing, why not create a few implimentations
of it which actually work well and put them into the sources?
People seem to like MacOS X don't they? With a nice bootscreen, and with the
latest version of kde, won't linux be similiar/better than macOS to the
"click click" type users?
