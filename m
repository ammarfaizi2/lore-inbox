Slightly off topic ... but I couldn't think of a better place to ask, or
at least not one with more knowledgable people on the subject.

I'm looking to upgrade my Motherboard.

So I'm wondering which Athlon/XP motherboard you guys would use? I know
there were (or are?) problems with some of the VIA chipsets and most of
the Athlon MoBos seem to use some VIA chipset.

Anyway. Suggestions welcome.

Thanks,
EAM
