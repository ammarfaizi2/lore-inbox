There is no big change relevant to TP X60 during 2.6.18rc, so I don't
think it's a regression in the hd-audio driver code.

You must see difference with mm1 (suppose that mm1 already includes
the latest ALSA patches).  When the CORB/RIRB interrupt gets broken,
the driver first switches to poling mode, then single_cmd mode as
fallback.

Also, try disable_msi=1 option for mm1.  MSI seems broken on some
systems.
