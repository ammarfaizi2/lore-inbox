They forgot INTERACTIVE Unix! This is/was a Kodak Company. When word
gets out, they may even sue Kodak. They claim that any form of
Unix (whatever that is), now belongs to them because one of their
predecessors purchased a license. Get this, it was a non-exclusive
license even!

Maybe they think all Judges are stupid??  Probably not, it's likely
just the death throes of a company that drank a fatal dose of corruption.

FYI, I noticed an unauthorized reproduction of some of my code. It
used a variable, "i", in a "for" loop. Maybe I should go buy a lawyer.
I can show that only persons who had been previously been poisoned
by FORTRAN would ever use such a variable name. This certainly
points to me.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
