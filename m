I don't see many people reporting that kind of
problems... as a first-year CS student I can attest
that most students, even, never used Linux before. I
installed Red Hat Linux on a friend's laptop - how
much easier can it get - and kernel configuration just
flabbergasted him.

When people feel they are ready to start compiling
kernels, they should learn to do so properly, in my
opinion. The I-want-the-latest-and-greatest genre
roughly coincide with early tech adopters, no? :)
