Jon and Martin,

	You seem to be saying different things. If the submitter wants
to take the bug they need to be able to change the status to ASSIGNED.
But according to Jon (and my experience) I was not able to change the
status or take a bug (although I could change the owner).
	Is it possible to make it so an owner can change the status?
If not you should change the FAQ to describe the procedure for
letting people know you are working on a bug.

Thanks.

Hanna
