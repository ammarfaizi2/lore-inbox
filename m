   Which is a concern since both Linus and Larry made it clear bitkeeper
   would *NEVER* be required of contributors. Is there nothing generating
   nightly tarballs off cron right now ?
   
As stated in a followup posting, that kind of thing is available.

I don't see why people fly off the handle on this.  It only matters if
you need the tree as of 5 minutes ago bleeding edge type stuff.  If
you can wait a few days, then just hang on for Marcelo's next
prepatch.
