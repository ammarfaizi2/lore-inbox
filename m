Look at it from the other side.  If you were in an all AIX or HPUX
environment and you wanted to support Microsoft products, it could be said
that it's not fair that you have to change jobs.  Oh please.

What a load of crap.  You *CAN* order a system with Linux on it, just go to
some computer manufacturer and ask for it.  If it's not available, install
it yourself or buy a workstation from Penguin Computing, or any other Linux
hardware mfg.  Retail choices are where the sales are.  That's not someone
after you, it's business.  The way to beat someone at business is either
break up a monopoly or beat them at their own game.

Stop blaming and do what they do better.  Period.

Choice is with you, not with the manufacturer.  Winmodems are software
driven, so instead of down-talking the manufacturer, get a driver from a
Winmodem supplier.  I have a Lucent Winmodem in my system right now, it came
with a Compaq PC and it works just fine in Linux.  PCTel makes a large chunk
of winmodems and are willing to work to get a linux driver out there if we
just work with them.

Fact remains--be open minded, and you will find that there are lots of
people who want to have their products on Linux (means more money for them
in sales) if we just work with them instead of blaming them as M$ clones.
