With the time you spent writing this long email alone you could have
worked on either documenting Evgeniy's interfaces or trying to write
test applications against kevent to validate how useful the interfaces
are and if there are any problems with them.

You choose to rant and complain instead of participate.

Therefore, many of us cannot take you seriously.
