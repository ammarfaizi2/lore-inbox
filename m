I'm not sure how you're defining "comparably".  If you mean they get
similar numbers from glxgears, that's possible.  But the feature sets are
not at all comparable.  Nvidia's linux driver actually exposes the
features available on modern graphics hardware.

If you're going to advise against the use of their products in a public
forum, I suggest you be a lot more specific.
