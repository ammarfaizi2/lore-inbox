PLEASE NOTE:  THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC REPLY.  ALL CORRESPONDENCE DIRECTED TO
REP. LADWIG'S E-MAIL ACCOUNT WILL ALWAYS RECEIVE THIS RESPONSE.

Thank you for taking the time to contact my office.  Your questions and
comments are important to me.  Because I receive massive amounts of e-mails,
you will only receive a personal response if you are a constituent of the
63rd Assembly District.  

In order for me to determine if you reside in my district, please make sure
your e-mail message included your address and telephone number.  If it did
not, please reply to this message and include your contact information.  If
you do not reside within my district I will be happy to forward your message
to your state representative, if you have not already done so.  

Again, thank you for writing.

Sincerely,

 

Bonnie L. Ladwig
State Representative
63rd Assembly District
