While I understand these numbers are on the mark, there is a tertiary
issue to realize.

Dell makes money on many things other than thin-margin PCs.  And lo'
and behold one of those things is selling the larger Intel based
servers and support contracts to go along with that.  And so you're
nearly supporting Martin's arguments for supporting large servers
better under Linux by bringing up Dell's balance sheet :-)
