Yes, but try going skiing to the Alps. Checkout French, Austrian, Italian
side glaciers. And try to get any response more correct than "we pipl buys
tickets, ski lift not works", and so on.

Ask "do you speak english?", and get "no".

Maybe I am exagerating, but decent english was hard to find during my
trips. I was better off using german.

When I once heard a Swiss and an Italian agree that bad english
rules I felt daunted. I am certainly no top-flight english speaker, but
that amazed me. I also realize that in around universities people tend to
know english better. But my view on using english to talk to people i meet
is that I'd better use it
