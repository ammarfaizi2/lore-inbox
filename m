No need to get indignant.  Just that these messages generally
go:

<Message 1>  You're copying things, you're breaking the law,
you're going to be nailed
<Message 2> Well what are we going to do about it?
<Message 3> Stop!
<Message 4> We can't we ahve to make this work with that.
<Message 5> Do it some other way you're doing foo bar baz
<Message 6>  We are not foo!  Define bar and wtf is baz?
<Message 7> Bar is biz, baz is delta, your economic model
is flawed, you can't think, you're stupid

.....

Or something like that.  I mean it's ignorable for a while but God,
like I can't find 10 contiguous messages from the past 2 days (I
signed on on friday) that doesn't include this thread.  The past
few hours have it where it's trouble finding a group of 10 messages
where less than 8 are this thread.

It's just getting excessive.  I'm expecting to see

<Message 200> Shut up moron!
<message 201> Hah!  Call me a moron 2!$*head?  You can't
code worth balls!
<Message 202>  Can't code?  I'll show you you ba@$!4%!

......

some time soon
