Agreed.

After being let go from VA, I've had to return all the graphics cards
and machines they loaned me, and as my own supply of cards (and indeed
all of my computer gear) is in storage somewhere in the US there isn't
much I can do about fixing this.  You'll have to pester the guys at VA,
most likely Jeff Hartmann.

Jeff?
