I just moved a server over to Fedora Core 2 (kernel 2.6.6) and
discovered that there is a need to run an old SCO binary.

linux-abi.sf.net seems quite dead as a project.  Is there any comparable
support for for foreign binaries in for the 2.6.x series?

Since even the developer and user mailing lists of the linux-abi project
seem quite dead, this seems an appropriate place to ask.

Thanks,
Steve Bergman
