Hi all

Some months ago, I asked this question, and thought about trying again.

The PERC/something card, based on the Adaptec (DPT?) chipset, delivered
by Dell on the Poweredge 2450 series servers among others, is currently
only supported in specific distributions, and not in the official Linux
kernels. As I want to run Linux-2.4.x, I can't find a kernel supporting
the PERC, and this annoys me... Does anyone know when this will be
merged into the main source tree?

Please Cc: to me as I'm not on the list

Regards

roy
