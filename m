Subject: 2.5.61 SMP -> solid lockup

2.4.61 on a dual PIII will lock up hard in less than 5 minutes for me.
No output on the console. CONFIG_PREEMPT makes no difference.
UP works, with and without CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC,
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC. My full .config is below.

The problem was introduced between 2.5.59 and 2.5.60. Unfortunately,
I don't have the 2.5.59-bk patches to do a further binary search.

Does anyone know an archive of older -bk patches, or some other way to
break up the 2.5.60 monster patch?

Thanks,
Tim
