pascal is a language that teaches you structured programming by making it
excruciatingly painful to write anything else. You can write basic in C and
sometimes people going from one language to the other basically do that.

If you have few classes and a lot of 5000 line subroutines then worry, but
there is no reason to assume that every ex basic programmer isnt going to
pick up C++ and good software design practices just because they once 
wrote basic
