For the intended audience, yes.

Who is talking about ISA? All cards we had in mind are PCI. Of course
you have to do the usual initialization work in your probe/release or
init/exit functions. These are just a few lines you find in any
beginners device-driver-writing book. I don't think that the UIO 
framework could simplify that in a sensible way.
