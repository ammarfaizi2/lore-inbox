Hello World !

If I recall correctly, RHL 7 shipped with a broken gcc. Has it been 
fixed ? Basically, is it safe to switch to RHL 7 for development 
purposes ? Presently I use RHL 6.2 with 2.2.14 kernel.

Apologies if this is not the proper list for this question, and yes,
thanks in advance.

Peace,
-amar-
