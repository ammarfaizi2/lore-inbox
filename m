Don't worry about these oopses and bugs...MAJOR hardware issues, I think i have a faulty chip.  segfaults on clean deb potato system.  windows WAS stable, till I started actually using the CPU, then
BSOD all over the place.  I guess it's time to see how good that warranty really is ;-)  Sorry for all the trouble.
