A client only solution that would talk to bkd? In a flash mate. But I don't 
think you'd like that ;)

You I'm sure mean a server side wrapper which calls on bk to extract sources 
and diffs and handles transport to the client. Not exactly hastle free and 
encouraging people to host their o/s projects with bk, is it? Probably of 
dubious legality as well (for scm developers).
