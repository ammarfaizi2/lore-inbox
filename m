I was informed by someone on this list that apparantly Aki died in late 
2000 or so (about the time his postings on this list ceased). That is 
just terrible.

My question now is, would anyone know what happened to the projects he 
was working on? Did anyone on this list ever download his 'vesafbd' 
kernel patch and source code at some point, and might have it archived 
somewhere? I would very much like to revive the project he was working 
on.

Regards,
