Its really you with very nice ability to blackmail anyone using BK. "We
don't like you, so we are changing licence under your back. Either pay 000,
or you have just lost access to your revision histories." [Oh and oone

BK *is* evil corporate software, with unique trapdoor capabilities, and
with unique ability to take away rights from user any time it wants.
