Assuming all people who have contributed to the Linux kernel also used 
their email address at least once to mail to linux-kernel, it wouldn't 
gain much.

I had a new email address, mailed to lnux-kernel, and less than 24 hours 
later the first spam mails arrived at this address.

And the spammers aren't dumb. These @-replacements are that commen that 
I'd be surprised if they still have a significant effect.
