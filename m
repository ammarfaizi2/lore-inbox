It's a very close analogy to security. Systems should not fail open, they  
should fail close.

The bad practise is software that does not, by default, identify its  
users. Whoever wants to allow users to post non-identifiable MUST be  
prepared to use other means to prevent abuse, and so this MUST be a  
conscious decision and not a default.
