Hi,

   Thought I'd drop a line to say that I've started a project, over
on Sourceforge, entitled FOLK (Functionally Overloaded Linux Kernel),
which basically aims to stuff as many patches as humanly possible
into the Linux kernel, just to see what happens. :)

   This is NOT intended as a project in elegence, clean design, or
any other such carp. The patches are sheer bloat. Their sole excuse
for existing on the planet is that they -do- offer a chance for
developers to showcase ideas alongside other people's code, and the
FOLK developers (read: me) take the heat for getting things merged.

   If you're interested in this Cthuloid-inspired insanity, the
project site is over at: http://sourceforge.net/projects/folk

   If you're actually crazy enough to want to help out (even if just
to offer patches, make suggestions, etc) PLEASE do!

   I read the list (and even sometimes post) but unless it's
list-specific, I'm probably going to be reached fastest if you e-mail
me direct to my development e-mail address: jd9812@my-deja.com.
