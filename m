At http://www.hyades-itea.org you will find a port of Adeos for Linux
2.6 to the ia64/SMP architecture, currently running on Bull's
Novascale systems.

The main objective of the EU-funded (ITEA) HYADES project is to adapt
standard technologies for applications that require real-time
response, associated with heavy, parallel computations.

HYADES is a partnership led by the Thales Group, composed of various
organizations interested in deterministic intensive computing on the
Linux/ia64 platform, among which are Bull, MandrakeSoft and Dolphin.
The contribution of the HYADES project to the community will extend
beyond the port of Adeos, by adapting the RTAI/fusion experimental
technology to fit their needs on the ia64/SMP architecture.

The Adeos/ia64 patch and others can also be found at the usual place:
http://download.gna.org/adeos/patches/

Enjoy,

-- 

Philippe.
