I'd do that normally, but it's the wrong point in the cycle -- we're
getting ready for Fedora Core 5 at the moment; it's not the time to be
doing such things. We can apply the patch... but we'd have to turn the
config option off :)

What you're seeing is the whole point of the patch, surely? And it _is_
a config option -- people aren't forced to turn it on.

Would it help if we added a printk to make it more obvious what's
happening, which gives the na√Øve user the opportunity to turn off the
config option just to get things working again? Somethign along the
lines of "Faking irq %d due to CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. If your machine
crashes now, don't blame akpm"?

Out of interest, does your i810 patch fix the problem which was reported
in November by Eyal Lebedinsky ("2.6.14.2: repeated oops in i810 init")?
