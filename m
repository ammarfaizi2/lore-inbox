There is a savannagh project called the Linux Kernel Documentation Project
(LKDP) (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lkdp) set up by Abhishek
Nayani but it has been inactive for some time. I will eventually merge
with it (I have made contributions to it in the past) but am waiting to
get the last chapters finished first. It might be me being awkward but
it's difficult to have a number of people working on one document and
keeping the writing style consistent.
