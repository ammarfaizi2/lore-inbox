This thread was continued with this post:

Quoting LM:

Even though SGI is producing machines as noted above, and planning
on scaling to 512 or even 1024 processors in a SSI machine, that ability
to scale remains to be proven.  Meanwhile, IRIX is running a 2048 cpu
SSI machine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as noted here: 
http://www.sgi.com/newsroom/press_releases/2003/october/msrc.html

So, the original point seems to be holding for now.  It will be interesting
to see just how far the new (2.6) linux kernel will scale.

I've been having difficulty getting posts from home to reach lkml due to
a problem with my ISP inserting a bogus "Delivered-To" header, which
results in bounces from vger.kernel.org.  If this message reaches lkml, 
then my efforts to fix this have been successful.
