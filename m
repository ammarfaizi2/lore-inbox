Hello, I'm new to the list and I have a question (or two, or three, or... ;)

I just purchased a Tyan K7 Thunder (Dual Athlon motherboard) and I am running dual 1.4GHz Athlons and a GeForce 3 on it. It appears that the current (2.4.7
kernel) agpgart module does not directly support the AMD-760 MP chipset. I am planning upon modifying agpgart to support it. My question is: Is anyone already
doing this? I don't want to re-create the wheel, I just want full support on this screaming fast system.

Are there other mailing lists that I might want to join and ask this question on?

Thanks,

PGA
