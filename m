David has already made it clear that he doesn't care to manage such a list.

Why don't you go start one, if you can see so much value to it? From the
sounds of it, people would appreciate such an effort, on your part.

Please - not on any of these lists. Not for seeking employees, nor for
seeking volunteers to create mailing lists of your preference. There
are plenty of other forums available.

Thanks,
mark
