I sure wish I could :-).

Why should my comments piss anybody off?  I am just trying to point
out a problem, as I see it, an offer suggestions for improvement.
Other developers will either agree with me or they wont.
Contributions are not made only through writing code.  I contribute
through code, bug reports, ideas, and suggestions.  I would love to
dive in and try to help fix some of the kernel problems but my hands
are just to full right now.

My comments are not meant to rush anybody and I am not criticizing how
long it is taking.  I know everybody is doing everything they can just
like I am, and they are doing a terrific job.  I am just suggesting a
modification to the way the kernels are distributed that is more like
the early versions that I hoped would allow us to maintain a stable
kernel for distributions and production machines.
