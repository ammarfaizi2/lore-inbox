All:

Hi, I'm a PhD student at Texas Tech University studying usability
practices in open source software communities.  I worked with a few
open source developers to tailor this survey for the open source
development community, and about 13 developers participated in a pilot
test last year.

I am now looking for responses from a larger number of developers.  It
will take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes, and your responses will
help me (and others) understand how open source developers approach
the problem of usability in software.

If you would like to complete the survey, please go to:
http://english.ttu.edu/survey/TakeSurvey.asp?SurveyID=30Lm53M3757KG

You are invited to post this URL on any additional email list or blog.

Thanks in advance for your participation.  Please feel free to contact
me if you have any questions or concerns.

thanks,
-Dave
