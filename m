Probably, but the genirq implementation also uses GFP_ATOMIC.

Indeed. Haven't really touched that code for a while.

__avr32_udiv64 has only one caller, in time_init(). I'll see if I can
eliminate it.

The 64-bit shift functions are called from architecture-independent
code, so that will be harder.

An attempt at a DMA controller framework, which is used by our MMC
driver as well as a couple of sound drivers. I can remove it from the
patchset if you want, as I haven't forward-ported any of the users yet.

Implementation of the linux/clk.h API. David Brownell convinced me to
implement it for AVR32, as it is used by a lot of ARM drivers,
especially the AT91 ones which could mostly be shared with AVR32.

Sorry, I missed that one. Appended below.

Atmel, or more precisely Atmel Norway, which is the design center
that designed the AVR and AVR32 architectures, stands behind it. Atmel
Applications Engineers have received a fair amount of Linux training
already, so I don't think we'll be dropping this on the floor any time
soon.

I've started writing up a "Getting Started" guide at
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GettingStarted. It's mostly
complete, although I haven't actually uploaded the toolchain patches.
I'll do that in a couple of minutes.
