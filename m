Intel maybe moving part of chipset design to India but Apple still have their 
product design with them which they haven't announced they will move anywhere 
- or have they? 

I am not sure if Apple today designs and manufactures chipsets and CPUs in USA 
- most likely not, they buy it from IBM/Freescale. IBM/Freescale must have 
designed / manufactured the chipsets and CPUs anywhere - again most likely 
outside the US.  And from what I have heard Apple computers are assembled in 
China. 

So since long Apple's computers are designed in the US and manufactured / 
assembled outside of the USA. And that continues to be the case going 
forward, unless Apple announced they will move "their" product design to 
somewhere else as a result of Intel's move.
