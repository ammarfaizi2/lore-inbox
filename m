Dear Sir/ Madam,
 
 
 
       SOLICITATION FOR BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP
 
 
 
 I am the first son, of the late president of the Federal Republic Of Ivory  =
Coast,(General) Robert Guei, who was murdered along with the interior  =
minister on the 19th of September 2002. May his gentle soul rest in peace. A  =
 curfew has been imposed in my country and the
 current president; Mr. Laurent Gbagbo has ordered my immediate arrest and   =
detention. A lot of my father's close friends and relatives who are believed  =
 to have a connection in the coup are currently behind prison bars and under  =
 unbearable torture.
 
Fortunately I was smuggled out of the country by men still loyal to my late  =
father.
 Right now, I am safely away from all the trouble; another African country =
has offered me refuge. However all is not well, as President Laurent =
Gbagbo(the current president)has virtually frozen all my father's entire =
known asset. Face with this situation it is not wise for me to
personally invest our foreign fund neither is it advisable to continue to =
leave it under my family's name. Hence I make this proposal to you, to =
graciously  assist me, take custody of Twenty-seven Million United States =
Dollars (US$27,000,000.00). Also you are to front for me and my family in the =
areas of business you deem profitable.
 
 
This sum of US$27M has been secretly deposited into a reputable security =
company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to arecommended =
beneficiary. The fund will be released to you by the security company based =
on my recommendations, on that note, you will
be presented as my family business partner who will be fronting for me and my =
family in any subsequent ventures.
 
 
 
To show my preparedness and appreciation to conduct this business with you, I =
shall give you and your family US$5.4M of the funds and 20% commission on all =
proceeds realize from the investment of this fund. Also US$1.35M is to be set =
aside for any eventual cost that may occur in the process of this =
transaction.
 
 
 
Please, I need your full support and co-operation for the success of this =
venture. I plead with you to treat as urgent and confidential.This is a =
delicate issue, which demands a great degree of secrecy.Have my current =
political status in mind.
 
 
I sincerely will appreciate your express acknowledgement of the receipt of =
this mail.
 
 
 
Yours truly,
 
MR. SOLOMON GUEI.
