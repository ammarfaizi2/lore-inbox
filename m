What you want is the kind of proxy Luke Leighton was talking about in
a recent post to lkml concerning his effort to port FUSE example code
in to kernelspace. In his model you can replace the underlying
filesystem because the user processes are only seeing what you present
through the proxy - so although proxy inodes/superblock/etc. remain
constant, the underlying filesystem might get swapped around or moved
someplace else and the proxy has to work out whether to return errors
or simply block until the backing filesystem is available for use
again once more.

Jon.
