My worry is that l-k will now house discussions of 2.0, 2.2, 2.4,
2.5, aa, dnj, et al...

I care very little for discussion of all the kernel varients other
than those that I am interested in.

In fact, I really could care less about any dicussion other than
2.2 and 2.4.   However, I have to wade through all the discussion
of the other versions to get to what I want.  Often there is nothing
in emails that idenfity what versions the other is talking about.

And now with the flood of new kernel trees, the info I am
particularly interested in is going to be even further buried.

Since the powers that be are utterly against breaking l-k into
topical subgroups, how about the various "versions" including something
that I can use to identify and toss those messages I am not
interested in.

I'm primarily a 2.4 user, why do I care about all this 2.5 discussion?
