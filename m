Linus/Linux,

A patch has been posted that integrates NWFS into the Linux Kernel
for version 2.4.15-pre6.  This patch is available for download at
ftp.timpanogas.org:/nwfs/nwfs-2.4.15-pre6-1.bz2 and 
ftp.utah-nac.org:/nwfs/nwfs-2.4.15-pre6-1.bz2.  

This patch is submitted to Linus for consideration for inclusion into
the Linux kernel as a compatibility file system to support Native 
NetWare volumes under Linux.
