And you don't have a jumper on most laptops I've seen - neither do you
want to disassemble the laptop every time you decide to upgrade the BIOS
(at least I know I don't).

I've also seen lots of PCs that do exactly things like flashing the BIOS
during the first install cycle after you power up. I've even had to
return one because of user intervention (some guy flicked the power
during BIOS upgrade...)
