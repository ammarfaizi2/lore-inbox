Program for finding and sniffing WAP's on your wireless card.

I see downloads for windows, bsd and linux.  wellenreiter should do what
you want, i think.

There's even maps available there, so you know what street to go stand on
to download your mail!

I really don't know too much about this stuff, I have 10 aeronet 350's and
a 350 series WAP sitting under my desk that Cisco gave to me for free, but
no time to play.

Very nice article on the front page of that site about american airlines
using 802.11b, the group that audited them say they even witnessed an
intrustion while scanning the airline's setup.
