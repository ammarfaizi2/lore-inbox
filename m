Write up a proposal and send it in for a quote. See if Larry is a man
of his word and quotes you a fair price for doing the work. Post the
proposal and the quote. Then see if there is enough interest to fund
the project. There are probably ten tech news web sites that will make
a lead story out of this. Negotiating a true settlement is much better
than sending thousand of useless emails that achieve nothing.
