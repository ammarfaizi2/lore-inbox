Not a legal requirement in the United States. In fact, using a
"social security" or "taxpayer identification number" for
identification is contrary to federal law and a SS card contains
the words; "Not for identification".

This is rigidly enforced by many federal agencies and completely
ignored by others (go figure). Banks say they need to have a
SS number for 1099 forms, even for accounts that earn no
interest! It's just that their databases have an entry for
SS numbers (if required by the kind of account), and the
software is defective, requiring that field to be filled.
The result being that many person's rights are violated because
of defective software!

Incidentally, I recently obtained a so-called identification
badge that is now required for me to have access to my airplane.
I purposely left the SS# entry blank when I filled out the
form. This raised a stink that likely went all the way to the
state house. I got the badge. It seems that a State Government,
that has no business regulating air commerce, also wants to
keep my SS# on hand for surveillance. You need to keep putting
those attempts down.
