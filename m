The kernel only incorporates what is _really_ necessary. A jpeg decoder 
and a progress bar manager would never become part of the kernel! 
splashy proves that this kind of feature are absolutely not necessary in 
the kernel as it's feasible in the user-space. Move to splashy, it'll 
require you less work than patching your kernel ;-)

I just wonder if one can also put background pictures on the TTY only 
from user-space...

See you,
