But we already do that anyway.  For example, IPsec calls the crypto
functions with a spin lock on the xfrm_state.  As it is, you're
allowed to call crypto functions while holding spin locks if and
only if you're in softirq context.

Incidentally, that is something I intend on changing.  There is no
reason why we can't do away with that spin lock on the fast path
for IPsec.

Agreed.

The other thing we could do with a flag is to use it to set GFP
flags for memory allocation.
