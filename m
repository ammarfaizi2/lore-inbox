How about taking the "GPL exported" symbols just as notes which show
their usage is not considered a derivative work by the copyright 
holders? This is what I always thought it was there for. This of course
means someone can't simply add that "note" and expect it to change the
way the copyright holders think of their work.

I don't expect this would do much in court, but isn't that for binary
driver people to worry about because it is granting more rights than
the GPL allows. Maybe it could be written in legalease to give them
more confidence. And it lets open source developers know where they
stand.
