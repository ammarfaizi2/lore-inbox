I've been led to believe, from a response in this thread, that the
errors must be generated by reads, because someone asserted that no
CRC checking is done on writes.

The motherboard is a SuperMicro S2DGU, but the IDE controller having
the problem is not on the motherboard, it's a Promise Ultra66 card.

No, I don't think so, and I just installed a brand new Antec 550W
power supply, so I would imagine that I've got more than enough power
and the power supply fans plus the additional case and CPU fans should
be enough to cool the machine adequately.
