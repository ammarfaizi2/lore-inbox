Hello friends.


I have RH 70 with original kernel 2.2.16-19.  Later I have compiled newer
kernel 2.4.10 but it contains bugs in AX25 support, and therefore I decided
to use old version of kernel 2.2.19, but it didn´t have been compiled it
with AX25 support, so I need to do it.  If I try to compile kernel 2.2.19
with kernel 2.4.10 actually running, it's not possible. MAKE gives me some
errors.

Please let me know how to compile old kernel.


thank you.

Duro.
