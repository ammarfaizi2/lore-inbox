Subject: 2.4.20-pre5-ac4 hda lost interrupt

 Hi Alan,

 I was going to test this one by building a system, but I can barely get
it to run. The main problem is a lot of `hda lost interrupt' messages on
the console, and doing anything takes forever. Good news is that the
filesystems seem ok after rebooting. This is the first -ac kernel I've
tried since 2.4.19 was released, so I don't know for certain if this is a
new problem in -ac4.

 The box is a K6-2/500 with 128Mb (Ali M1541 chipset) and a Seagate
Barracuda IV. Compiler is gcc-3.2. With the same compiler and both 
2.4.19-rmap14a and 2.4.20-pre5, hdparm -tT reports speeds of 54MB/S and
approx 20MB/S. With -ac4 it reports 52MB/S and 771.47kB/S !

 Logging in takes an age, and it is too unresponsive to do anything. 

 Also ctrl-alt-del appears to be ignored, as does trying to kill it with
magic-sysrq (but sync and help  worked). Maybe I didn't give it enough
time ( > 5 minutes waiting to see if ctrl-alt-del would work).

 The config, dmesg, and lspci output follow. Anything else I can offer ?

Ken
