Are you saying that they *don't* want it to become popular?  C'mon,
support for the OS would be *wonderful* from a commercial
standard.  Someone calls in and says "this isn't working..." and they can
say (if it happens to be a bug of some sort), "Well, yes, this was fixed a
few hours ago and here's where you can get the patch."  :-)

Or even supply precompiled and easy-to-install kernels for those that are
braindead and can't be bothered to learn to do it themselves.  They'd
still be getting *lots* of money to do a basically easier job of
supporting something, seeing as the Linux developers are mostly *NOT*
braindead (any of you devs out there let me know if I'm wrong, lol).
