That is exactly the point. If you are so long with Linux, you can
consider yourself a technical person. For you, different that probably 
more than 98% of the people on this planet, these messages are useful,
because it's your job.

They are geeky, but useful - If you got a system that causes trouble.
Otherwise, if your system works right, they are just some more bits 
flickering on your screen.

If I go to the doctor and get an X-Ray, while the machine fails, I have
no whatsoever advantage if I see the error log, simply because I could not
interpret it even if I wanted to. All I understand is "it worked" or "it
did not work" and if someone tells me that it does not insult me that I
lack some details that are important to the doctor.

Why oh why do we always need to compare ourselfes to Windows. "Windows
does this, windows does that" Whatever.. that is of no relevance. And if
it was QNX or RTOS we are cloning and the thing we cloned is a good
idea, what shalls...? It seems to me that everything that lacks the
status quo in kernel message visability is a windows clone?
