ISTR he wrote that he had 2 (identical?) drives that were reporting 
the same serial number.  Somewhat, but not exactly like I have two 
different epson printers, both usb driven, and which except for the 
reported serial number, return otherwise identical data when queried 
by the usb drivers during dmesg.  Which I find odd because one is a 
C82, 4 color model, and the other is a Photo 820, 6 color model.
