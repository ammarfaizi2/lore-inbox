Subject: [BK2CVS] locking problems on kernel.org
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The last few days the locking mechanism on kernel.org has been broken.
The result is that the CVS export tree isn't getting updated.  I've mailed
the admins and gotten no response, does anyone know who manages that
machine?
