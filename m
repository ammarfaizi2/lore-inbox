This will be presented by Orran Krieger June 18.

K42 is a operating-system research project (available under LGPL) focused in large part on scalability in the implementation of core OS services.  We will give a brief overview of the project, discuss some of the recent performance results running 64-bit
PPC Linux binaries and discuss the major ways that our implementation of Linux services depart from the norm (hopefully making sure to bring up all the truly offensive and contentious ways).  We will leave most of the time for questions and discussion.
