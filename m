Yes, I know that nVidia is evil, but I am stuck with 20 AMD systems with
the Nforce 420 chipset and was wondering if there is any possibility of
getting the integrated network component working with a 2.2.x kernel. 
Upgrading to a 2.4.x kernel is not an option.  Any pointers would be
appreciated.

P.S.  Please don't flame me.  I do my best to influence the hardware
buying decisions in this company towards vendors that support Linux. 
This one slipped under my radar, unfortunately.
