dear all,

i'm in the process of learning how to write modules.  i've read the first 4
chapters of alessandro rubini's o'reilly book "writing linux device drivers=
".
looking through modern drivers, i see a lot has changed.

for the next few months, i'll prolly have a lot of really newbie questions.
i realize that this list is for serious kernel development. =20

is there a more suitable mailing list for me to sign up for?  debian has a
mailing list both for package maintainers and those who are trying to learn
how to be package maintainers.

is there a similar thing with the kernel mailing list?

since i haven't signed on yet, can you please cc me the reply.  if it turns
out this is the correct list, i'll sign on pronto.

much thanks!
pete

ps- you have a great FAQ.  i now know how to avoid the APIC errors that get
printed on all my consoles.  thank you!
