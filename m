Maybe I can make the point another way...
TANSTAAFL:  There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.

Marcelo is a volunteer, and maintaining the 2.4 kernel is not his full 
time job.  Marcelo isn't beholden to people demanding a kernel release 
NOW NOW NOW.  If you want that type of support, you have to pay for it.

I consider my personal obligation as "do my best as time and sanity 
allows."  Demanding of people what they already give freely is a poor 
way to motivate.
