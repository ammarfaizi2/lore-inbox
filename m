All,

any chance that the new 3ware Driver (for the new 9xxx series of their 
controllers) will be added in one of the next Linux 2.4.x Kernels?

Andrew Morten has it applied to his 2.6.7-rc1-mm1 already - I could 
provide the 2.4.x version of the driver. It is contained on my Driver 
CD and it is under the GPL. Oh... and yes, it works ;-)

Bye
  Michael
