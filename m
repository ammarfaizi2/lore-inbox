Okay, so separate PAG IDs and credentials. Have a separate credential cache
to which the PAG ID is but one of the keys, then share entries that have a
common (remote-user-ID,fsname,domain) key.

Grouping is superfluous and not trivial at any time. Use ACLs.

PAG IDs _are_ ephemeral.

That's not exactly so (see next comment).

Like AFS, you mean? Each AFS cell (or cell group) may contain an independent
kerberos server that dispenses keys that are nothing to do with the kerberos
tickets granted by another cell.

For instance, the openafs.org cell my grant me a ticket for accessing there,
but that wouldn't be any use for redhat.com or cambridge.redhat.com
cells. Whereas the redhat kerberos server might grant me a ticket that'd
permit me to access either redhat cell.

Assuming there is a join operation. I think setpag() should go, leaving only
newpag().

Independent joins aren't necessarily good either. They add lots of complexity
and consume lots of kernel resources.

I've tried to make my PAG patch support a multi-use environment.
