Merry Christmas everyone,

I have a question concerning the bcm4400 driver: It is merged in the 
kernel, but marked as experimental, so it does not work quite well. 
Broadcom released their Linux drivers for this card under the GPL (see 
http://www.broadcom.com/drivers/downloaddrivers.php). Is there a 
specific reason why you don't use these drivers?
