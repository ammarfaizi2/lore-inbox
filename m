Well, it was a testing machine with no important data, so I could just
afford to lose everything, as it was the case.

I tried, but it proved more difficult than expected, since the computer
was a laptop and I couldn't move the HDD to another computer. Using the
distro rescue CD was useless as it's kernel didn't have XFS support. All

example.
