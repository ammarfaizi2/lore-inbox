I've just read about Greg Kroah-Hartman (one of the 17 kernel 
developers) proposal about what OSDL could do to improve the kernel 
work. As a none-kernel developer I think it's important to look closer 
at some of the issues.

First I have to mention that the kernel is an important but only _one_ 
part of a Linux system a user may buy in a shop. There are many more 
parts which have to fit in until a system is bought. IMO the OSDL's task 
is to care for all of these parts, not only at the kernel. Nobody will 
buy a computer if it only has a superb kernel but the rest doesn't fit 
equally well.

Second the breakthrough of the Linux desktop system has been predicted 
so many years, it's hard to find the correct number. It's not worth to 
discuss this much, just think the OSDL thought it necessary to start a 
survey about it last year. The results of this survey can be read here 
(http://www.osdl.org/dtl/DTL_Survey_Report_Nov2005.pdf). Besides the 
usual points as e.g. hardware difficulties, there is one single point 
which stands out. Doesn't it strike you odd when you read that these 
users still ask for applications not available on a Linux system? Even 
if the majority had Linux deployed? Can you imagine what the first top 
inhibitor of the Linux desktop adoption means?

Well the answers is quite simple, it means a low market share! A market 
share so low that manufactures don't care about providing drivers, even 
so low they don't even provide documentation. Too low that vendors don't 
care for using parts which have Linux drivers, let alone selling Linux 
systems even if it's cheaper for them. Don't you think it is much more 
important to raise the market share above a minimal necessary level?

So the number one priority to solve many of the problems of the Linux 
kernel is to increase the market share above this minimal level. To fix 
the first top inhibitor of the Linux desktop adoption. I guess very few 
of you have an idea how this can be achieved. Neither had the desktop 
architects at ODSL before I mentioned it to them. Even then they are 
reluctant to listen to me (see 
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/desktop_architects/2005-December/000349.html) 
albeit they finally seem to agree (see 
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/desktop_architects/2005-December/000369.html). 
At least they and most probably you don’t know any alternative.

So if Linux should finally become widespread used by everybody my 
“cross-platform development” initiative (see 
http://wyoguide.sourceforge.net/index.php?page=Cross-platform.html) has 
to succeed. Only then becomes a Linux system attractive for the ordinary 
users and therefore for the vendors and the manufactures.

You may ask now why do I tell this here and wonder what you have to do 
with. Well first it was Greg Kroah-Hartman proposal to the OSDL and 
second because I think my proposal will solve many of the limitations 
you currently face in your work. I think you are well advised to 
advocate this to the OSDL so they finally look for a desktop architect 
in their fellowship program 
<http://www.osdl.org/about_osdl/Maintainers/document_view>. You may 
further advocate the use of the wyoGuide guidelines so the Linux desktop 
only has just one set of guidelines instead of several. And you are free 
to participate in wyoGuide so it’s not only a good but the best for the 
Linux desktop.
