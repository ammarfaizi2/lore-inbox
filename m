Aside from the above reason, I believe the mechanism behind the write 
command should also be considered. The notifications generated by write 
can currently be enabled and disabled only through an "all-on" or 
"all-off" mechanism - it doesn't leave room for user- or group-specific 
permissions because it's based on the mode of the TTY special file.

ACL support in devpts would allow much more fine-grained control of who 
is allowed and who is denied access to writing messages on your terminal.
This would come in very handy and I personally believe it should be 
possible to have such control.

Sorry for the random post and thanks for considering this reason,
