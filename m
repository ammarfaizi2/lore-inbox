After she'd done her ledger she would clamber into her hammock and read a book for a couple of hours..
Proudly, fearfully, hesitatingly I exhibited him to my friends..
Those burial-clouds that lower, victorious, soon to devour all, .
Be sure you're sure -- you know --.
His workbook is wedged in the window,.

Regards,

Elvis Hancock
