    Who the heck said anything about rewriting the kernel?  I'm just looking
into coding a C++ framework for those whom may like to use it in modules,
mostly for hack value.

    And yes I do know C++ and it can very well be used for low level stuff
such as the kernel.  Now that doesn't mean I'm going to go wild and start
writing extensive templates, exceptions, standard template libraries, or any
of the other unneeded crap (mostly from the last C++ revision) either.

    And as far as the comment of being a troll goes I could definitely find
better uses of my time.  Only reason for a post here is because I'm looking
for some guidance on a couple of minor issues I've encountered.  The C
brigades can go back and rest in the barracks now.
