The problems occured with enabled CONFIG_DYN_TICK_USE_APIC. As I recompiled=
=20
the kernel the following is without the option. Everything looks good so fa=
r=20
(except resume...), so I am not shure what caused the bad behavior.

BTW, I can enable CONFIG_DYN_TICK_USE_APIC without CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC, is t=
his=20
intended?

$ dmesg | grep -i "time\|tick\|apic"

Software suspend still does not work, it hangs on resume. Any ideas what co=
uld=20
be the cause? I've applied these patches on top of 2.6.12-rc5:

2.6.12-rc4-ck1
software suspend 2.1.8.10
reiser from 2.6.12-rc5-mm1
ieee802.11 stack and ipw2100 1.1.0
hostap 0.3.7
shfs 0.35
fbsplash 0.9.2-r2
dyn-tick
