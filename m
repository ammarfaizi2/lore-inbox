Hi,

due to a possible incompatibility between one of the
OPN admins soliciting money on a regular basis and the
policies of the network where kernelnewbies.org is
hosted we have decided to move the #kernelnewbies IRC
channel to another network.

You will be able to find us on:

	irc.oftc.net / #kernelnewbies


Kernelnewbies is a project meant to help people learn
about operating system development by providing information
and operating a mailing list and IRC channel where current
and future developers can help each other. More information
about kernelnewbies can be found on  http://kernelnewbies.org/

kind regards,

Rik
