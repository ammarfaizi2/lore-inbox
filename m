Subject: dnotify for kernel 2.2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have been going through the trouble of adding dnotify to our 2.2
kernel because we don't want to switch to 2.4 yet. I wonder:

How many folks are interested in dnotify for 2.2?

Is it a really bad idea?

Is imon really dead?
