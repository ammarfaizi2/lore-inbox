Due to ussg now stripping email addresses, I can't send this email to
the people who need to know it.  I can only send this to linux-kernel
and hope it does not get lost in the noise.

There is a list for discussing Linux's PCI implementation, and it is
called linux-pci.  To quote from the webpage:

"You can ask questions and report bugs on the linux-pci mailing list. Ask
majordomo@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz to subscribe."

ie the list is called linux-pci@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz.  Discussion
about PCI Express in particular NEEDS to go to this list.  You can cc l-k
too if you like.  But by not cc'ing that list, you do not draw attention
from the right people.

Not all of us can drink from the firehose that is linux-kernel.
Particularly when it's full of random political / pseudo-legal shit.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
