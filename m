Hi!

I don't know if the mystery has been solved yet, since I didn't follow the
whole thread, but...

DeepThought ~ # man df
[...]
       -i, --inodes
              List  inode  usage  information  instead  of  block
              usage.   An  inode  (short for index node) contains
              information about a file such as its owner, permis-
              sions, timestamps, and location on the disk.
[...]

:-)

Regards,
Gert
