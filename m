RTFM :)
you can find it in Documentation directory.
if you're using mkinitrd, it's even easier.

i thought you're annoyed by the message "no soundcards found".
it cannot be solved until you build the emu10k1 into kernel.

no.

of course, the module could be requested later.
the ALSA core routine calls request_module("snd-card-0"), if the
entry is not present.

basically, you can safely ignore the message "no soundcards found"
at the boot time, because it shows only the built-in drivers.
the modules can be loaded dynamically if you set up the configuration
correctly.

i've never used devfs by myself, so i cannot tell exactly whether it's
a devfs problem.  but the fact that you can load snd-card-0 module
manually implies that the problem lies on auto-loading mechanism.
