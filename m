My main interest in doing these is to help 2.5 development as 2.4 is not 
changing dramatically anywhere in the near future. As the number of data 
points increase the ability to sift through the information will decrease. 
The comparison to 2.4 kernels has been made in the past and I felt that 
showing the progression of 2.5 would be more helpful as the change made by 
each step could be quantified. I dont mind posting a full set of benchmarks 
but people are less likely to read through a huge set of data trying to find 
the relevant information.  If someone feels I am in error I would be happy to 
change what I'm doing.

Cheers,
Con.
