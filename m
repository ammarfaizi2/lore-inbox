I missed that in the FAQ the last time I looked at it.  Thank you.  Also, 
I'm a little surprised that Google searches don't bring up the FAQ when you 
search for "linux jobs".  FYI.

Of course, my post to LKML was regarding the lack of this sort of 
information in David Miller's reply to the person who originally posted the 
job announcement to LKML.

David has asked us to end this thread.   I think it's a good idea.
