Did you try
- save .config
- make distclean (or mrproper)
- restore .config
- make oldconfig

I think there's a corner case which patch application leaves file mod 
dates wrong somehow.just "make clean" is a cure, but this is the big gun.

I realize you probably know this and tried it before asking, but it sure 
looks like what I see which I brain fart and don't clean properly before 
the next build,.
