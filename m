Hi pal,
how are you?
I think I found a great opportunity to make money online, would like to share it with you.
Just check out this site, http://www.incotrust.com - they're paying 5% daily on your investment, can you imagine?
First i was a  bit sceptical, but it works! I more than tripled my investment now. They accept e-gold or e-bullion.
Just use my referral link http://incotrust.com?ref=2513451
Best,
stay in touch

Mike
