Not for 2.4 - just too many changes to the core kernel code.

Heinz already submitted updates for LVM.

No idea.

I don't think Rik has even asked for this to be included yet, as he
still has some known issues to be worked out.

In any case, Marcelo (probably) isn't out hunting for new patches to
add (especially after Alan's email about 78 patches he sent yesterday).
If the maintainers feel their code is ready and ask Marcelo to include
it, you will probably read about it here first.

Cheers, Andreas
