Damn you.  That thread got me to download subversion source and read it -
mistake I won't repeat any time soon.  I've spent several months wading
through fairly disgusting code - block device drivers are not pretty,
ditto for devfs.  I had more than once found myself grabbing Lovecraft
to read something that would be less nightmare-inducing.  But _THAT_ takes
the fscking cake - I don't _care_ what Larry (or anybody else for that
matter) does to people who had excreted that code.  No, wait - I _do_ care.
I want video of the... event.

I don't use BK, but you can be damn sure that I won't touch SVN.  Ever.
