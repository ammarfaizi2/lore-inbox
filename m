Subject: NFS-performance drop with 2.4.4 and 8139too
Message-ID: <20010502115457.A6739@sonne.glowinginthesun>

When upgrading from kernel 2.4.3 to 2.4.4 my 
NFS-performance drops badly.

NFS-server:

knfsd, linux-2.4.4, 8139too-0.9.16


NFS-client:

linux-2.4.4, 8139too-0.9.16

transfers seem to start with about 2 MB/s but drop 
immediatly to about 20 K/s.

http, ssh - performance is as usual.

When switching the client back to linux-2.4.3 with 
8139too-0.9.15c nfs performs with about 6 MB/s which 
is fine with me.

Please tell me if I can provide any further helpful information.

Hendrik
