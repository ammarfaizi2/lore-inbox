C'moon! It'd make IT so much more interesting and fun!
Think of all the increased communication skills mankind
would develop through this!

Seriously, *laughs*, I don't think debugging user problems
would escalate into such a scenario. Let me again point out
my proposal:

There is *one* line of boot messages shown. Whenever the
System hangs, you will see the last message. Carefully
designed messages will greatly help, of course.
