Hi, 

I was just surfing on Anzwers when I found your 
website http://lwn.net/Articles/11015/.

I love it!
I appreciate the content and design quality.

My name is André Botelho and I'd like to help. 
I thought that because we are in the same industry,
and you could be interested in some information I have. 

If you want to read it, simply reply to this email with a 
blank message and I will email it to you. 


Best Regards, 

André Botelho
