hi all

How can I force RAID devices to get status non-failed? I have a so-called 4
out of 15 devices failed, and it failes to start.

The true devices have _not_ failed!

That is - md[0123] are just fine, and as they generally are on the same drives 
as md4, something _should_ be possible

Thanks all

roy
