I didn't just jump right in yesterday when this first came up because
I wanted to take the time to properly compose a statement in view
of the fact that just about everything on the Internet is being
recorded forever.

I am certainly glad that Linus has awakened to the RMS threat that
I mentioned on this list several years ago. As soon as I saw
"GNU/Linux" and Stallman's claim that Linux was simply a small
component of a larger "Operating System" of which he claimed
ownership, I became much disturbed and reported the same on this
list. To many, my report was simply "the rantings of a lunatic."
However, now some are beginning to see the light as history
continues to be rewritten and a history lesson is unfolding.

Stallman's claim to ownership pitchforks hog shit in the face
of hundreds who took the time and effort to port BSD utilities
to that wondrous new operating system called Linux and I was one,
claiming no glory for myself, nor even bothering to add anything
to the BSD licenses that existed within these utilities. This
was done for the greater good of all (and of course me, because
I wanted to use these utilities under Linux), not for the political
aspirations of a few. These efforts go back to the days when
"distributions" consisted of 56 floppy disks and Linus was
in Helsinki, working on his degree. The FSF didn't exist, and
GNU was the name of an immature compiler. Sometimes we need
to be reminded of the history of a particular thing because,
once out-of-mind, history tends to be rewritten by those who
would advance in its new "interpretation."

Every time I accidentally execute `uname` with an -a instead of
a -r, I am reminded of the history rewrite as I am presented with:

Linux chaos.analogic.com 2.6.16.24 #1 SMP PREEMPT
  Wed Jul 12 11:32:34 EDT 2006 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
                                              ^^^^^^^^^
If history continues to repeat itself, the FSF has just about
run its course and, when contributors continue to realize that
their tradition of giving for the common good, is being replaced
by the politics of a small body of thrill seekers, they will
revert their licenses to become more liberal rather than
restrictive. The problem could remain that excessive damage
may already have been done.

Cheers,
Dick Johnson
