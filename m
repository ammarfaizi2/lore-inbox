What I would like to have is a card thar plays nice with weird extended 
VGA text modes like 132x60 and good refresh rates. Most cards don't 
support it and I'm stuck with a 80x25 terminal (and I don't like the 
slow frame buffer modes) or the refresh sucks so much that my eyes 
bleed. Good 2D performance and quality is also required for desktop 
stuff like browsing, coding, DVD, etc.
