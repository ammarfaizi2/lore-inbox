Thanks to all responsible for getting these captures 
of the Kernel 2.5 Workshop prosentations put together.

There is one major shortcoming of the recordings.
Usually, only the comments of the presenter(s)
can be heard.  This reduces the value of these
recording substantially, since the comments, insights
and give-and-take of the other kernel developers would
help us get a much more complete understanding of the
areas being presented -- try listening to Andy Grover's
Power Management presentation and you'll see what I 
mean.
