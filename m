Ahhh, so Victor makes the money off all the Linux people because
his is the only part that's _patented_.

Do you see what I'm getting at now?  When a party chooses Linux
for their platform they're choosing all of it, and maybe they'll
be taking Victor's stuff along with the rest simply because it's
the rest that they _really_ want.

Why should Victor be making money off your work?
