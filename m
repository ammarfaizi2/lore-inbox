Not that I'm aware of.  You could ask badari and hollis as their names
are associated with that item.  Alternatively you could scour archives
for messages with [CHECKER] in the subject (specifically these issues
were in the march - june 2003 timeframe).  I suspect many have been
patched, but you may find a few that still need fixing.

thanks,
