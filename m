Yes - lets stick to fewer numbers.  They can count faster, instead
of having a long string of them.  I hope linux doesn't
end up like X. "X11R6.8.1" The "X" itself is a counter, although
it is understandable if it never increments to "Y".  But
that "11" doesn't change much, and then there are three more numbers. :-/

I think two numbers are enough. If "4.1" was a scre-up, release
"4.2" instead of a "4.1.1".  People shouldnï¿½'t try to readtoo
much information from the number structure - there are logs, docs and
websites for that.
