The most important factor of kernel code size when analyzing things is
the base.  Anything else you can enable/disable it to see how large it
is.  The size of other subsystems is important but less so.

Currently partition support and fs/buffer.c can not be compiled out
which is unfortunate if you don't have a disk.

I just ran the numbers between 2.4.21 and 2.6.0-test1 compiled with
2.95.4 because it usually produces the smallest code, of the supported
compilers.
The minimal bzImage has grown 62139 bytes.
The minimal vmlinux has grown 146712 bytes.

And it is my feeling the kernels get farther apart the more options
you add in.

Tracking down the size increases of various subsystems is probably a
job for a smart script and ccache.
