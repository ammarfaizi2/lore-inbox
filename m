Yes. In fact that line referred to my copy of your archive.

I just checked the kclug archive that was mentioned, and it has
two things: a copy of your archive and a copy of Ted's archive,
nothing new.

kclug/linux-activists/Volume6/digest and
kclug/linux-activists/Volume6/digest217 are duplicates.
