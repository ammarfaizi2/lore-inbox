Like in movies where:
- kid A writes a book report
- kid B copies it
- kid B gives the book report in class before kid A
- kid A gets an F because he can't give his report

Mind you, this may be a very childish way of looking at things.  I 
PERSONALLY don't expect a problem.  I've released code under GPL before, 
and people respected, to my knowledge, my copyright.  They were thankful 
and appreciated using what I wrote.  I loved the whole experience.  But 
I have a strong enough sort of personality that I would go on the 
offensive were someone to steal my work, take credit for what I did, 
etc.  Some people are much more timid.  Rather than damning them for 
being timid, those of us who can understand how they feel should try to 
help so that they will share their ideas with us.

The fear exists because this kind of theft happens, and not just among 
children.

Keep in mind that being introverted is normal and common.  Being timid, 
on the other hand, is something completely different and can be the 
result of some sort of past trauma.  People try to share and get burned, 
so they don't share anymore.
