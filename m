I have pointed out to Intel that 802.11b is _not_ subject to FCC
regulation problems and I hope they will release a driver for the
802.11b Intel/PRO 2100 mini-PCI cards sometime in the (near?) future. It
would be a sensible thing to do IMHO.

How long is a piece of string? I get replies from Intel when I write to
them, but it is all a bit vague. They will not commit to anything, which
is is frustrating.
