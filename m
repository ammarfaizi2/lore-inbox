    Ohh. Some college buddies and I were considering the difficulty

    Sure, there are simpler ways to build chaotic circuits, but a
    radioactive peripheral is cool!

Why?  There are plenty of cards out that that have hardware and more.
The one in the machine I presently use is limited to 1Mbit/second of
data from a noise-diode (fed through various functions in hardware to
further obfuscate the data).
