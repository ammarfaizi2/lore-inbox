Well, both options require the use of Windows - most guys around here aren't 
going to be able to view it. (I would really like to view the docs but 
couldn't - Firefox displayed plain text and Konqueror displayed the page 
properly but there were no links on the page as displayed by Konqueror.) 

BTW,  both Konqueror and Firefox support SVG (not in their stable versions but 
none the less, bleeding edge versions do give an option to enable SVG 
support.) So it would be helpful to have a version viewable using Linux 
browsers.

Thanks
Parag
