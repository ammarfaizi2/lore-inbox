Extents will provide 0.01% speedup at most, and with increase of code
complexity. Not a nice tradeoff if you ask me.

If you want faster suspend, that should be easy. You'll need *current*
2.6.16-git , and userland tools from suspend.sf.net . There's HOWTO
that explains how to set it up. We can even do LZF these days...

Actually Rafael was *very* nice at him, I'd say. Pointing for tiny
inefficiencies, without patch attached is not really helpful.

I have repeatedly pointed him on ways how he can *really* help. There
are ways to do suspend2 in userspace these days, but Nigel refuses to
use them.
