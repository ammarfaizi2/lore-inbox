This turns out to be a genuine bug.  The queue lock and xmit lock are
intentionally taken out of order.  Two things are supposed to prevent
dead-locks from occuring:

1) When we hold the queue_lock we're supposed to only do try_lock on the
tx_lock.

2) We always drop the queue_lock after taking the tx_lock and before doing
anything else.

This path obviously breaks assumption 1) and therefore can lead to ABBA
dead-locks.

I've looked at the history and there seems to be no reason for the lock
to be held at all in dev_watchdog_up.  The lock appeared in day one and
even there it was unnecessary.  In fact, people added __dev_watchdog_up
precisely in order to get around the tx lock there.

The function dev_watchdog_up is already serialised by rtnl_lock since
its only caller dev_activate is always called under it.

So here is a simple patch to remove the tx lock from dev_watchdog_up.
In 2.6.19 we can eliminate the unnecessary __dev_watchdog_up and
replace it with dev_watchdog_up.
