  Dunno,  I am trying to figure out suitable Perl-RE filters which
  would match only these ALL CAPITALS scam letters, and yet not to
  match any legitimate postings...

  The principal problem is, I think, that Majordomo filtering works
  within the individual lines of the message, not by the entire message,
  and there could be some legitimate email with all-capital lines...

  Traping on keywords fails also when they are (intentionally ?)
  mis-spelled.

  Anti-spam technology really needs constant evolution, as those
  spammers do evolve themselves...
