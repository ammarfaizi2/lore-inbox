That was precisely the point, no?

For some people, this goes "bake kernel, make sure nobody is doing  
something critical, reboot, hang, curse, reboot to old kernel, apologize  
for delay, stop fiddling with this thing for today" as the machine in  
question needs to do other stuff.

That's certainly the reason why I haven't figured out yet why our damn  
"new" central server doesn't boot bloody 2.4 without hanging - I certainly  
don't *want* to run 2.2 on that thing. Probably config options.
