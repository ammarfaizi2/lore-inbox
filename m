[snip: Intel/PRO 2100 driver support]

I just had a response from Mr McLaughlin at Intel. They appear to have a
centrino team where all requests about/for the drivers are forwarded to
to gauge the interest in the drivers.

A guess is that the more people are interested in the drivers, the
bigger the chance that they some day will become available, one way or
another. I have made my interest known to Intel, not sure I could do any
more than that. (Not really got any close pals in Oregon...)
