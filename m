    [WATCHDOG] remove experimental on iTCO_wdt.c

    [WATCHDOG] Atmel AT91RM9200 rename.
    
    The new Atmel AT91SAM9261 and AT91SAM9260 processors use a different
    internal watchdog peripheral.  This watchdog driver is therefore
    AT91RM9200-specific.
    
    This patch renames at91_wdt.c to at91rm9200_wdt.c, and changes the name
    of the configuration option.

    [WATCHDOG] watchdog/iTCO_wdt: fix bug related to gcc uninit warning
    
    gcc emits the following warning:
    
    drivers/char/watchdog/iTCO_wdt.c: In function ‘iTCO_wdt_ioctl’:
    drivers/char/watchdog/iTCO_wdt.c:429: warning: ‘time_left’ may be used uninitialized in this function
    
    This indicates a condition near enough to a bug, to want to fix.
    iTCO_wdt_get_timeleft() stores a value in 'time_left' iff
    iTCO_version==(1 or 2).  This driver only supports versions
    1 or 2, so this is ok.  However, since (a) the return value of
    iTCO_wdt_get_timeleft() is handled anyway, (b) it fixes the warning,
    and (c) it future-proofs the driver, we go ahead and add the obvious
    return value.

    [WATCHDOG] w83697hf/hg WDT driver - patch 16
    
    This is patch 16 in the series of patches that converts
    Marcus Junker's w83697hf watchdog driver to Samuel Tardieau's
    w83697hf/hg watchdog driver.
    
    This patch contains following changes:
     - Add copyright notice for Samuel Tardieu also.
    
    This is the last patch in this series.
    
    The original description for Samuel's driver was:
    driver for the Winbond W83697HF/W83697HG watchdog timer
    
    The Winbond SuperIO W83697HF/HG includes a watchdog that can count from
    1 to 255 seconds (or minutes). This drivers allows the seconds mode to
    be used. It exposes a standard /dev/watchdog interface. This chip is
    currently being used on some motherboards designed by VIA.
    
    By default, the module looks for a chip at I/O port 0x2e. The chip can
    be configured to be at 0x4e on some motherboards, the address can be
    chosen using the wdt_io module parameter. Using 0 will try to autodetect
    the address.

    This is patch 15 in the series of patches that converts
    Marcus Junker's w83697hf watchdog driver to Samuel Tardieau's
    w83697hf/hg watchdog driver.
    
    This patch contains following changes:
     - Clean-up initialization code - part 2:
       * the line reading "set second mode & disable keyboard ..."
         is plain wrong, the register being manipulated (CRF4) is
         the counter itself, not the control byte (CRF3) -- looks
         like it has been copied from another driver.
       * I think garbage is being written in CRF3 (the control word)
         as the timeout value is being stored in this register (such
         as 60 for 60 seconds).
       * We only want to set pin 119 to WDTO# mode and leave the rest
         of CR29 like it is.
       * Set count mode to seconds and not minutes.

    [WATCHDOG] Winbond SMsC37B787 watchdog fixes
    
    * Added io spinlocking
    * Deleted WATCHDOG_MINOR (it's in the miscdevice include
    * Changed timer_enabled to use set_bit functions
    * WDIOC_GETSUPPORT should return -EFAULT or 0
    * timeout should be correct before we initialize the watchdog
    * we should initialize the watchdog before we give access
      to userspace
    * Third parameter of module_param is not the default or
      initial value

+ *
+ *	This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

+ *
+ *	(C) Copyright 2003-2006  Sven Anders <anders@anduras.de>
+ *
+ *  History:
+ *	2003 - Created version 1.0 for Linux 2.4.x.
+ *	2006 - Ported to Linux 2.6, added nowayout and MAGICCLOSE
+ *             features. Released version 1.1
+ *
+ *  Theory of operation:
+ *
+ *      A Watchdog Timer (WDT) is a hardware circuit that can
+ *      reset the computer system in case of a software fault.
+ *      You probably knew that already.
+ *
+ *      Usually a userspace daemon will notify the kernel WDT driver
+ *      via the /dev/watchdog special device file that userspace is
+ *      still alive, at regular intervals.  When such a notification
+ *      occurs, the driver will usually tell the hardware watchdog
+ *      that everything is in order, and that the watchdog should wait
+ *      for yet another little while to reset the system.
+ *      If userspace fails (RAM error, kernel bug, whatever), the
+ *      notifications cease to occur, and the hardware watchdog will
+ *      reset the system (causing a reboot) after the timeout occurs.
+ *
+ * Create device with:
+ *  mknod /dev/watchdog c 10 130
+ *
+ * For an example userspace keep-alive daemon, see:
+ *   Documentation/watchdog/watchdog.txt
