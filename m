Subject: no boot with 2.4.x
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hello All,

I compiled the 2.4 kernel on my laptop last night.
After editing lilo, I rebooted the machine. I selected
this new kernel and when it began to boot, it told me
that it was uncompressing the kernel and that the 
kernel uncompression was ok.  Then it just froze.  Any
ideas?

Ryan
