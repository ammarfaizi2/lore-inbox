Is RAID1/5 support even safe in the current 2.5 series?  I saw Neil post a
message while ago but wasn't sure if he was being faceitous or not...
I've not been able to get a single 2.5 series kernel to compile since 2.5.8

Main build works.
This error occurs during "make modules"


gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.8/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -W

There's not a single definition of md_wait_queue_head_t anywhere in the code
except raid5.h 218.

Couldn't find md_wait_queue_head_t anywhere so changed line 218 from:
        md_wait_queue_head_t       wait_for_stripe;
to:
        wait_queue_head_t       wait_for_stripe;

And same thing on line 222 from:
        md_spinlock_t           device_lock;
to:
        spinlock_t           device_lock;

And in raid5.c line 254:

And raid5.c line 328:
