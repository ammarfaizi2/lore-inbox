Stop right there - you are wrong.  That is just the corporate party line
used to justify stripping consumers of their rights.

In the US (I don't know about the rest of the world), we have a legal
right (upheld many times by the courts) to "fair use".  Much of the DRM
is a way for companies to deny the people that buy a product their legal
fair use rights.  This has been through the courts numerous times with
VCRs and photocopiers.

I am allowed to make copies for personal use, such as taking an audio CD
and creating MP3s so I can listen on another device.  Music companies
and the RIAA are trying to remove that right.  I have a TiVo so I can
watch TV at my convenience instead of some network programmer's idea of
when I should watch, but some networks want to ban TiVo-like devices as
well (despite "time shifting" with VCRs having been upheld by the courts
as fair use).

I want to play DVDs under Linux legally.  According to the laws, I've
bought the DVD and the right to play it (and even make backup copies
under fair use).  However, the DVD consortium has restricted my (court
upheld) right to do this.  The DMCA just adds criminal enforcement for
this.

The way a lot of people USED Napster was illegal.  That doesn't mean
that Napster should be made illegal.  Also, there are plenty of civil
laws regarding copyright infringement; why do we need additional laws
making it also a criminal offense?

Again - stop right there.  Reverse engineering to copy something has
been upheld by the courts many times.  We probably wouldn't be here if
Compaq, Phoenix, and others hadn't reverse engineered the IBM PC BIOS.
The patent side of things protects against this; is BK covered by any
patents?

You have every right to defend your trademark (and you should, or it
becomes diluted).  Unless BK is covered by one or more patents, you have
no right to tell people they can't take their time reverse engineering
it (if it takes as many man-years to build as you say, why do you
worry?).

By your logic, why do you support Linux?  It is just copying Unix.

Why don't YOU don't something more productive with your time other than
call someone's boss and complain?

Get a life.  Are you going to call Transmeta and complain about Linus
working on something that rips off SCO's "intellectual property" (some
of which may even be covered by patents, something BK doesn't have)?

You chose to step into the frying pan; don't complain about the heat.

There are things that Red Hat won't ship because they are protected
under patents (good or bad).  Patents are the protection the US system
offers; if you don't come up with something original enough to rate a
patent, then anyone can copy it.

Please name something that "the creation of the product took 100x the
effort it takes to copy".  How much effort has gone into Linux, Wine,
GNOME, KDE, OpenOffice, etc. that originally was targeted to copy
another product?

No, because a growing number of people won't play their game.  People
are already bringing challenges to the DMCA, as more people realize the
implications of it.

Then you have nothing to worry about, since you are one of the
corporations.  You can "lock up" BK and try to silence the critics (as
you have already said you've gone after at least one person).
