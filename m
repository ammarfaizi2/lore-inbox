Hi Linus,

Does that mean that when the submission arrives at your end it's supposed to 
have a whole list of Signed-off-bys, one for each person who handled the 
patch?  Or is it only supposed to have one Signed-off-by, as close to the 
original author as possible?  Or one Signed-off-by with multiple upstream 
emails on it?

Regards,

Daniel
