Well it solves the dead lock by breaking the chain that links the
netlink system with the jungle of wireless locking :)

The spin lock in sk_buff_head acts as a mediator.  We only feed the
skb to the netlink system once that spin lock has been dropped.

Yes it is nasty.  However, so far wireless seems to be the only offender.
