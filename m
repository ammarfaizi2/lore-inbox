Why useless? It is the vendor's responsibility to write most efficient
drivers for their hardware, at least that was the case with the previously
popular systems like Windows and I don't see why it shouldn't be the case
with Linux which has successfully replaced those. Ask Compaq for the
driver and ask all your friends to ask them for it too -- customer demand
and satisfaction is what matters (or should matter) to commercial entities
;)
