Since this is a community-developed kernel, there is no "official" 
documentation per se; anyone is welcome to write whatever documentation 
they care to, and if it's good enough, others will recommend it.

The only true authority is the source code, but not everyone has the 
skill to grok kernel code quickly.

If you are interested, I am starting to review and update the 
Documentation directory - any help would be greatly appreciated.
