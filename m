HP will continue to support OpemMail for at least five more years. Please,
recommend it to your employers. If they get a significant income from
people who take up OpenMail, it will wake up people at HP.

It would be nice if HP stuck it to M$ up the arse by releasing it as open
source when the five years' are up.
