So far the only argument I've seen is: it's convenient.  Did I miss something?

The convenience argument is bogus.  A url is just as convenient, especially as
Larry has offered an appropriate home, one which will by definition continue
to exist as long as Bitkeeper stays alive.  Plus, the url saves download
bandwidth.  A compelling argument I'd say.

They can introduce themselves if they wish.  Or you can ask around.
