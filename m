As I've been lurking here for a while, I can appreciate that ones skin 
gets a bit tender after a while Larry.  OTOH, your replies have 
helped a lot of us lurkers to see a much more balanced view of the 
so-called argument.  Without your input, there aren't too many other 
voices to stand up and be counted.  FWIW, (not much I'm afraid) I'm 
on your side.  If the others want to do a similar program then they 
know what they want it to do and they should go ahead and write it, 
but IMO the users interface shouldn't be beholden to *anything* BK 
does.  If their offering is a better offering than BK, so be it, 
we'll have YACVS.  But, do it from a clean room, based only on what 
the programmer thinks is important, not on something that attacks 
your program, and even depends on it to be usefull.

In other words, stick around and balance the scales from time to time.
