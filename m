And it's clear you don't read our messages in this thread. You've 
attributed an invented quote to me, then insulted me for something I 
never said. How rude.

As I *have* said before in this thread: I *am* running a successful 
business that supports multiple people; I have created profitable free 
software products, and am putting R&D into new (and I think innovative) 
products.

Am I listed in the Fortune 500? No. That isn't my goal. It is possible 
to be a success, and contribute to humanity, and grow a business, 
WITHOUT megalomania.

Do I believe everything "free software advocates" preach? No.

Do I believe all the anti-copyright, anti-patent rhetoric? No.

Do I believe that you can sell custom software development and services 
based on free software? Yes, because I do just that.

I think you disagree because it pleases you to do so; obviously, you 
have no read my prior messages, since you invent a quote above to
