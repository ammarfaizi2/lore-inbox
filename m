But not in Europe. Only in the USA. Algorithms may not be subjected to patents
in Europe (by now).

Anyway, maybe you may not get catched in the intimacy of your room. But I
could understand that it's not acceptable as a legitimate proposal for a
worldwide used OS, as Linux is, to suggest to every single user to violate the
law in the intimacy of their room to be able to use it. I may feel safe in my
own room and I may use these tools if I'm able to, but I can't propose to
anyone to use these such tools, that's the point.
