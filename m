Please don't say that. I just searched the EVMS mailing list archives
dating back to December 2000 and there is not a single patch from you
Andrew. One or 2 pieces of psuedo-code, but no real patches.  Feel free to
look yourself, the archives are online.

Sure, if they really exist.

Andrew, just so you are aware, a number of your suggestions did make it
into EVMS even if you are not aware of it because they did not hapopen
immediately.  Some that come to mind that I think you originally proposed
are plug-in progress indicators (from pedtimer), nesting of partitions,
plug-in record header changes (multiple plug-ins per file).  These are just
the ones that come to mind, so keep the suggestion (and patches if you can
find any) coming.

Steve
