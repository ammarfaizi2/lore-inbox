They also claim Linux NUMA (a four letter word) is their as well, I 
forgot to mention
this one. I removed this one also. This claim is a little more out there 
since Dolphin
and Sequent developed hardware around it and on other Unixes. I don't 
think I agree with
this one but we don't use NUMA either.
