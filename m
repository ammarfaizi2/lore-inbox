Sorry. My graphics cards is ATI Radeon 9200. And I have a AX45H-8X Max Aopen's 
motherboard (with SiS graphics controler [I don't remember the exact model. 
You can find it in aopen page]).

I provide you my .config files (of 2.4.24 and 2.6.1) for if you detect any 
problem.

For the other hand, why you put 0x317 instead of 791?. Is it the same? I 
suspect this from your message. Why?

How can I know what number I could pass to vga=xxx in my kernel (where xxx is 
a number)?. Perphaps it's a newbee question. Sorry.

Thank you,
Xan.
