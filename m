	Ext3 in /, XFS over RAID 0:

ulises:/home# mount
/dev/hda5 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=3Dremount-ro)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=3D5,mode=3D620)
none on /sys type sysfs (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda6 on /var type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda8 on /home type ext3 (rw)
/dev/md0 on /mirror type xfs (rw)

	Attached is .config. I'll try to build another kernel with=20
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC support enabled today or tomorrow.

	Regards,


		Ender.
