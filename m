Oh, I missed your talk in OLS ;)

Basically I agree with the argument above.  Some hardware-specific
regressions are very hard to find only from review.  The famous
problem with ThinkPad in the last update was such a kind.  More tests
in a bigger place like mm tree would be required, indeed.

Unfortunately, the sync between ALSA and mm tree didn't work well
because of troubles with git/cogito at this time.  The sync process
shall be improved from now on.  So, please consider this as an
exception.
