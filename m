I am also a believer that it is the sender's responsibility to communicate
their wishes according to the generally accepted protocols.

At the moment, I believe the most popular and implemented one is
Mail-Followup-To. Set it however you want. Don't complain until you have
set it.

This is standard mailing list trivia, though, and so, please keep "don't
CC me requests" off the mailing list. :-)

My excuse for posting this is to offer Mail-Followup-To as a researching
starting point, rather than let people become frustrated.

Cheers,
mark
