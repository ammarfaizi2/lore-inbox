Hi Yiping,
the linux kernel community is happy to accept drivers from Via!

It's easiest if Via agrees to license the source code
for the driver under the GPL (see http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html )
If that's ok, then just put the source code up as a .tar file on a
web or ftp server, and send an email to the linux-kernel mailing list
explaining where it is and how to use it.

Thanks,
Dan
