Hmm, I see these are going for ~$100 on ebay.

Thanks.

The only more ideal thing would be something that looks like a 4 port
powered USB2 hub, but you plug a CF disk in, or a mass-storage device, and
it tries to boot from it.

You now can make random things by plugging in USB stuff.
Want a network accessible webcam, plug in a camera or three, a [wireless?]
network, and away you go.

Almost trivial to make and would be very cheap.
The problem is that pesky supply and demand thing :)
