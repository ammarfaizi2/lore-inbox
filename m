Very cool, and I definitely applaud Intel for supporting open source 
here.  A couple questions...

* is the 3D stuff available from git somewhere?  The download filename 
includes "-git-", but the checkout instructions reference cvs.

* is anyone working on a more dynamic GLSL compilation system?  i.e. a 
"JIT", in compiler technology terms.

Thanks,
