Hi all
			I am trying to compile a program which is using kernel_thread and its 
related functions.  I am not trying to compile as a standalone application. 
I am not sure  wheather I am doing right. I am able to compile the 
application. But I am not able to link. The error it shows is that, it 
cannot find the implementation of kernel_thread and all. But there is no 
libraries to link. How to tackle the problem.

	Also how to create the program as a patch to the kernel
Thanking in advance
regards
Blesson Paul
