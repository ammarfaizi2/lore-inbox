Can you check if the computer hosts the latest bios from its vendor and
if booting with "acpi=off" makes a difference ?

The content of /proc/interrupts after a known number of TX packets could
give some hint (use ping or such and correlate ifconfig output with
/proc/interrupts).

Please direct/Cc: further messages to netdev@oss.sgi.com.
