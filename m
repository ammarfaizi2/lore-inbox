so you are saying there should be only one OS.

Only one C compiler.
Only one assembler.
Only one processor.
Only one disk drive. (since all they do is copy... :)
Only one language.

Since all of the following ones are only "copies" of the first one.

And M$ must really love this one since copying is all they do.

And what would I have lost?

not much. I am still using a 200 MHz SMP PPro.
welll... I would loose the UCITA, DMCA, Carnivore, 75 (or is it 90) year 
copyrights, restrictions on re-engineering ....

And a TON of stupid software patent restrictions.

I would have gained a number of bugs. I still use the window manager from 5 
years ago... with my own enhancements.

And I still wouldn't use M$ based systems.
