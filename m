Who told you the document is stolen?

I received it *officially* from RealTek's support people.

Nevetheless, since you seem to imply that people inside RealTek might "leak"
this document against the orders of their hierarchy, I am removing it, and
I will only put it back online, and reannounce it, when I have _written_
authorization from their headquarters, instead of just a mail.

Thanks for casting doubt on the honesty and reliability of RealTek's
employees, something I would never have imagined before your post
