  IPsec tunnels are even worse, because, not only is there not enough
info returned, but, being paranoid, one should really not even trust it.
  ICMP Port not reachable for UDP port 500 are even more nasty, because
sometimes they indicate a REAL problem :-)

  Eons ago, I proposed a way to deal with this problem, see:
  http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/SSW/ietf/draft-richardson-ipsec-pmtu-discovery-00.txt

  I think that now that Linux doesn't linearize skbuff's prior to passing
them to protocol handlers, that I actually could get the fragment info from
the skb chain.

  Excerpt from document:

Gateway G2 upon receiving an ESP or AH packet that needs to be
reassembled, MUST take note of the size largest fragment received. This
value is compared to the previous largest fragment size. If this size
has changed by more than 10%, or more than 2*MSL time (i.e. 2 minutes)
has passed since the previous ICMP message, then an ICMP Datagram Too
Big message is generated. The largest fragment size is initialized to
576 bytes.
          
The ICMP datagram is addressed from gateway G2 to the originating node
C, and gives a size that is based on the maximum fragment size (above),
minus the IPsec overhead. The ICMP datagram is sent via the tunnel on
which the IPsec packet was a member. I.e. the ICMP is encapsulated.
                                                                       
A packet arriving at G1 with the DF bit set, does not cause the DF bit
to be set on the encapsulating datagram.

(proposal two changes the destination IP of the ICMP message)
