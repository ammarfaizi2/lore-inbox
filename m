ACK .... Which do you mean? :

-Hosts that don't have valid PTRs (which would be no PTR at all -- Not
deliverable, but not because AOL said so)

-Hosts that don't have valid PTRs, but DO have at least one valid MX
(Forward and reverse)

-Same as above, but said hosts MX's forward and/or reverse don't match

etc etc ....   I ask this simply because I DO know of users who have
complained their E-Mail to/from an AOL customer, didn't get there.  I've
always assumed .. well ... AOL user .. no comment :)
