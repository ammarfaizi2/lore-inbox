With the exception that IPv6 avoids the IPsec/fragmentation required
contradiction its no more secure. Network security is basically nil.
When you look at the kind of web of trust required to fix it and how
easily 'trusted' crypto companies are scammed I dont think its fixable

So IPv6 neither helps nor hinders
