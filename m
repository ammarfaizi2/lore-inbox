Not me -- copyright law defines derivative works in this way.

I already conceded on this.

?! I did not understand which quote, or which part. But I
suspect you're talking about lu-12.html (below), for which
just now you pointed me to.

This is the first time you gave me an URL. I'll look into it.

Insofar, you did not show me an example of need to create a
derivative work in the course of the ordinary use.

The embedding was not made by a fully automated process, was
it? Didn't someone had to create the advertisements, with the
purpose to be presented embedded in the broadcast? I suspect
-- without looking at the case files at the moment -- that
there was the creation of the derivative works...

Our (.br) courts do. I don't know (I'd have to read the cases
you cited) why did those courts ignored the intellectual
novelty requirement of a derivative work, but I'll look into
it.

Now I concede a lot: you have really substantiated some of
your claims, and I'll have to look into your case examples.
