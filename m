Subject: Promise PDC20269

I recently purchased a Maxtor 160GB drive, it comes with a Maxtor
PCI-IDE133 controller card (the card contains a Promise PDC20269 chip).
I discovered the hard way that the 2.4.16 kernel does not yet support
it. I was wondering, have you or someone else added support yet? If so
do you have a patch? I am currently working on extending the kernel to
see if I can add support but I have little knowledge about IDE, ATA-2,
large drives. I would appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks.
Bill Webster
