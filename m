I sent a brief message immediately after that one, about this not being 
slashdot. That was the very instant those router troubles stopped my traffic 
to/from vger.kernel.org. Maybe it'll arrive here tomorrow.

I'll say I only mention it because it seems a bunch of (only?) US Co.'s have 
this big bad attitude toward your effort, and it just sort of upsets me. no 
biggie. and no more slashdot from me.
