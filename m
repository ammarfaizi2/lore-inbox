gcc's approval process looks a lot like the Linux approval process. 
Dave's description of rth's work sounds a lot like the Linus Role in 
Linux...  with the exception I guess that there are multiple peer Linii 
in gcc, and they read every patch <runs for cover>  More seriously, gcc 
appears to be "post the patch to gcc-patches, hope someone applies it" 
which is a lot more like Linux than some think :)
