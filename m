What you don't want to accept is that some of us speak from practical 
experience, too. Just because you have not walked my road does not mean 
my road is non-existent.

It must be a very limited world you live in, if you must personally 
experience everything in order to accept it's reality. Has it occurred 
to you that someone else might develop different views based on 
different experiences and goals?
