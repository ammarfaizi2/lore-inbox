David,

Yes, fine, that is in fact why I did give Larry a brief overview of my
experience, as the consideration of experience is valid, and I have TWENTY
YEARS of experience in software design, development, and yes, sales.

Yet because I have never tried to "run" the businesses I have participated
in somehow that experience doesn't count in Larry's explicitly stated world
view.

Larry wasn't discounting "some of the posts" he was specifically discounting
my *particular* posts because I have never "run a business".  See how that
makes your stance come down on my side of the net?

The saddest part is that, in simple fact, the thread is about the sources
and natures of *INNOVATION* which is *EXACTLY* my area of expertise and that
leaves his "you don't know business" (even though I have been in almost
every version of the software business over the last twenty years) defense a
classic example of cupidity and faulty reasoning employed to undermine, I
mean "reinforce", a position.

Rob.

Robert the key isn't ability it's experiance, the golfer asks his caddy
questions becouse the caddy has more experiance with the course, the
players loearn from the coach becouse the coach has more experiance then
the players.

Larry is saying that the key reason he is discounting some of the posts is
the lack of experiance of the people involved, they have nice sounding
theories, but they have not put the theories into practice so they can't
backup their theories with experiance.
