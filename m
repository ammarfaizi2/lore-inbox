I like it because it avoids that any background task which is ran makes 
the fans turning like hell. It's also very advantageous with tasks like 
screensavers or a la seti@home (but few people have this on their laptop).

Ken, does this solve your problems (but that seems strange that all your 
tasks are nice'd) ?
