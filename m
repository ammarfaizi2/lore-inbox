I just submitted an article entitled "Why We Should All Test the New Linux
Kernel" to

http://advogato.org

the article is at

http://advogato.org/article/224.html

If you're not familiar with it, Advogato is an online community for Free
Software developers.  I would venture to say any Linux kernel developer would
qualify for a membership.

I hope you like what I have to say.  Perhaps if you'd like to encourage a friend
to test the kernel you could forward them the URL.

Mike
