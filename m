That's less than 90°C.  Water boils at 100°C.  How the hell do 
people expect coffee to be made without boiling water?  Magic?

No, the customers continued to prove to be total morons by total
ignorance of the fact that coffee *is* hot when fresh.  If they
cannot handle hot coffee, they can order ice coffee or ask for a refill
of their cola.
