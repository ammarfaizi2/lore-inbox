Subject: Request for data on K7 optimizations.

I'm trying to get some more solidified data in to one place to look at, 
so far everything's pretty scattered around, and a good amount of 
reliable information is difficult to find.

I'd appreciate it if everyone experiencing these K7 optimization problems 
could send me the following information privately, anyone not 
experiencing problems that has a few minutes to spare, I'd appreciate it 
if you could also send the information, and specify that you haven't had 
any problems:

Motherboard + chipset
Front Side Bus speed
CPU speed + multiplier
out put of "cat /proc/cpuinfo"
if avalible, RAM type and speed (both clock and CAS latency)
if avalible, PSU wattage, and amperage on all outputs.

Hopefully I can spot a pattern that hasn't been readily apparent before.

Thanks,
-NK
