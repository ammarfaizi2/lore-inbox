That's the arrogant point of view, you can have, if you get paid for it. Please correct me, but I don't know any major tree from 
volunteers.

I have my own tree integrating XFS, LoopAES, UML, IPVS, Freeswan with X.509, LSM, TUX  and some smaller netfilter things. It's not 
a big deal integrating these patches, but it's still too much work. Guess, why i am not able to release this to public?
