Subject: Temporary home for sctp.refcode.org and sctp.chicago.il.us
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Due to the collapse of Northpoint, both sctp.refcode.org and
sctp.chicago.il.us have been down for more than a week.

Many of you have been asking about the web sites because of my talk at 
the Linux 2.5 Summit.

I've found a temporary home for both sites--they'll probably be there
for a month or so.  The temporary locations are:
	www.cs.uchicago.edu/~piggy/sctp_refcode
	www.cs.uchicago.edu/~piggy/sctp_chicago_il_us

Some of the links are broken, but you CAN download source for both
distributions.  I'll clean it up a bit after the Bakeoff (say early
May)...
