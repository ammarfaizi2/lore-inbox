Anbody know if the Canopy Group is still involved in SCO/Caldera?  Given 
  that their web site lists the Caldera -> SCO name change, I would 
suspect that they are. They did the original VC funding for Caldera and 
Lineo so I have a hunch that Lineo will be left alone.

Ray Norda may be crazy, but he's crazy like a fox!

Always, always, always... Follow the money
