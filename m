Ronald,

Make rpm works fine in 2.6.0-test2, as for them putting a RPM up for you 
to install from it is not likely to happen.

You can always visit your distro provider to get a copy of what they 
_may_ have if any.

Most people that test are very comfortable with configuring their own 
from the kernel sources.

Cheers,
