Wrong carrier, though. It's not US Navy carriers (those people use NT,  
after all, and this was "depose Solaris"), it's carriers like AT&T - phone  
companies. And I suspect many of those 10,000 threads are handling one  
phone conversation each. Or maybe one half of one.

In fact, that's a problem space I find much more interesting than the  
military. *These* people need to be robust in peacetime. They can't afford  
a big showy piece of hardware that breaks down when it's finally needed,  
because "finally" is a very short-term goal.
