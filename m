this argument I agree with. especially since 64 bit platforms have a
higher stack footprint by nature (bigger call frames and more to store
on the stack) and if x86 allows stackbloat, the other architectures get
in trouble and are going to need really large stacks.

this I don't see as a reason; illegal drivers should never be a reason
to clutter our kernel one way or the other. And for GPL 3rd party
drivers the problem isn't there realistically. If they were reliable in
2.4, they're reliable with 2.6+4K stacks. If they're not then they need
to be fixed (eg your previous point).
