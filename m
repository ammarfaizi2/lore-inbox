Kernel versions 2.6.1-rc3 to 2.6.2. I have been using a tainted kernel with 
the NVIDIA drivers since 2.5.75 up until now. I am currently using 2.6.2-bk1 
right now and have not notice it yet. 
I have only been at my computer now for 15 minutes, so not enough time yet to 
happen. If there is any other info that you may need let me know.

Thank in advance

Walt
