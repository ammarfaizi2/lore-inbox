Hello,

I have problems with the ATI Mach 64 (Rage 2) video card. After a boot, I
get just a blank screen with a few vertical lines, but the system boots up
normally beacuse I can reboot the machine anyway. I don't get a sigle
error in compiling.

I didn't noticed the 'ATI Mach64 display support' which is in the 2.2*. I
am booting with bzdisk, if it matters.

Thanks for all the help.

Regards, Rok Pergarec from Slovenia.
