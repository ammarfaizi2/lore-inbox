well, evolution 11.99 will "theoretically" import exchange calendar
appointments
and stick them into your calendar.  this works almost every other time
:)

and I use a perl based script that queries the global address book
called pabber.

I have not found something that will interact smoothly with the server
based
personal address book or calendar.  so, if anyone knows of such a
program, please, please,
please let the world know (or at least me :)
