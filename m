My guess is that it is a joke.  'Meister Proper' is the German 
  Mister Clean (the big, bald guy on the same-name cleaning 
  agent bottle).  I'm not sure of the spelling, though.  It's been 
  a while since I've seen the commercials.
I dunno if it's Finnish, though.  Never been there.  Maybe it was
  put in by a German developer.  Maybe not.  It was there when
  I started.
