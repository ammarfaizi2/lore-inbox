         Sure things should be added, they were examples..

         No, I don't say if you know a PL (a tool) then you're a
programmer (or
 an architect). Everybody can learn C, it is simple (I like it), if you
 consider the reserved words, structs, unions, etc. But not everybody
can
 program well or right. Tools, of course, take time to learn, what I say
 is background is more important than "one" or a bunch of tools. No
 university or school can teach every good tool nor can teach every
 aspect of kernel programming.
 
         Experience is the way to be a good programmer, nobody is born
with it.
