Hi,

I'm running SuSE Linux 9.1 with kernel 2.6.5-7.95

I've suspended my laptop and it was in suspended state for couple of
weeks. When I resumed it it took unusually long and after it is finally
succeed I found most of applications swapped out. Ie I had some 200MB of
items swapped and some 500MB of memory free after resume.  I'm wondering
if it is VM system got crazy for some reason.
