Clearly the truth is somewhere between your two viewpoints, but one thing is
for sure:  The Linux kernel is hands down the better product.  There are
still a few exceptions to this rule, but those are disappearing rapidly
(epoll cures the last one that gives me heartburn).

designers have accomplished.  I think the first step would to torpedo
X-Windows :) ...But that's a topic for some other mailing list.
