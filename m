Exactly.  What I'm figuring out is that discussing business models here
is a lot like trying to tell a teenager that he is mortal right before
he goes out for a drive.  I didn't listen, he's not going to listen,
and you aren't listening.  So I've tried about a half dozen times
to gracefully bow out and you keep coming back with more.  No thanks.
I figured it out, you go figure it out, then we can have a fun discussion
about how to move things in a more positive direction.  Baiting me isn't
going to work, the fish aren't biting.
