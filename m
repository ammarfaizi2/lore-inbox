Subject: 2.5.40: problems loading/unloading ide-scsi modules
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0210011837120.897-100000@dad.molina>

I apologize in advance if this message is too long.  I included a lot of 
data; I hope it is not too much.

I was puzzled when others were reporting oops and warning associated with 
either booting 2.5.39/40 or associated with idea-scsi in some way (burning 
a cd, loading/unloading the modules, etc).  I was not having any problems 
with any of this.  My normal mode of operating includes loading some 
modules at boot up, running cdrecord, mounting and unmounting CDs.  I 
wasn't seeing any oops or warnings, but I wasn't loading and unloading 
modules during a session.  The modules would get loaded, and wouldn't get 
touched again until they were unloaded when the maching was rebooted/shut 
down.  When I started rmmoding modules I was able to duplicate what others 
were seeing.  This could be associated with module loading in general, but 
I am able to load/unload other modules without problem.  There was also a 
theory that some folks were having problems attributed to ISAPNP so I 
compiled this kernel without support for it.

My normal complement of modules include:

Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
ymfpci                 45440   0
ac97_codec             12256   0  [ymfpci]
soundcore               6724   0  [ymfpci]
parport_pc             16516   1  (autoclean)
lp                      7712   0  (autoclean)
parport                24032   1  (autoclean) [parport_pc lp]
ide-scsi                9504   0
scsi_mod               60440   1  [ide-scsi]
rtc                     8896   0  (autoclean)

At this point I can load/unload any of the above modules, including 
ide-scsi and scsi_mod with no problems.

After a typical session, my list of modules include:

Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
sr_mod                 14508   0  (autoclean)

lp                      7712   0  (autoclean)
parport                24032   1  (autoclean) [parport_pc lp]
ide-scsi                9504   0
scsi_mod               60440   3  [sr_mod sg ide-scsi]
rtc                     8896   0  (autoclean)

At this point I can unload/load sg with no problem.  If I try to unload 
any of the other ide-scsi modules (ide-scsi, scsi_mod, sr_mod) I get a 
freeze at shutdown with various results.  If I rmmod ide-scsi and don't 
reload it there are no problems at reboot.  If I reload ide-scsi the 
system console freezes and shutdown ends with:

Shutting down devices
psmouse.c: Lost synchronization, throwing 1 bytes away.

If I try to rmmod sr_mod I get:

I can remove ide-scsi, scsi_mod, but I can't remove either scsi_mod or 
cdrom since they still think they are being used by sr_mod.

When I reboot now I get the following (hand-copied since the console is 
dead when it happens):
