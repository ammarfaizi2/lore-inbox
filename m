	I'm not aware of the TEXT/PLAIN viruses (ignoring jokes, er,
social comments, about the GPL).  Could you point me to a sample?

	I recall from past discussions that there's considerable
sentiment on l-k that zip'd patches are undesirable.  If the patch is
inconveniently large, it can be split into several messages, or placed
on an FTP server.  Inconvenient for the developer, maybe, but better
for the list as a whole.

	Separately, I think we've spent enough time with the off-topic
topic.  Perhaps we can move the discussion offline?
