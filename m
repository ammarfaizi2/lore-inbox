I can't debug Nvidia's code even to see why it might have broken. Its as
simple as that - no politics, no agenda on them opening it, simple technical
statement of fact.

I really doubt Nvidia will open their driver code. I've heard them explain
some of the reasons they don't and in part they make complete sense.
