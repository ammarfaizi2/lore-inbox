The SPEWS listing looks correct ...

Being a blacklist operator myself (DSBL http://dsbl.org) I
may surprise you that I _do_ think spammers have a right of
free speech and a right to spam. It's just that I also think
nobody has an obligation to listen, everybody can accept or
deny any email they want for any random reason .. after all,
if it's your mail server, you get to decide what to do with
your private property.
