Hi,

   See the article below.

I just read that the specs are out for three different types of CD-R
drives in terms of disk capacity and speeds from Constellation 3D,and it
is heading towards manufacturing. It's great for movies and coporate
archiving, but was degraded for the consumer market -- Nothing above
5Gb/side for the consumer whereas for the coporate it's 200Gb/side. I
don't think it will  compete for the PC market unless the disk capacities
are upped! Probably purposely degraded so that you can't copy a HDTV DVD
to your PC CD-R disk. Here is the
