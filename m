Just to follow up here.  On kernels 2.6.2-rc1 and 2.6.2-rc2, it just
hangs on bootup and doesn't give any Oops output.

When I tried out 2.6.2-rc1-mm[1,2,3], it would start booting, but
oops immediately with the one I posted before, but I've re-created
here.  

I'm at work now, so I won't be able to do any tests besides remote
kernel compiles during the day.

My plan is to apply the patch from Andrew where sort_main_extable() is
moved up above mem_init() to both 2.6.2-rc2 and to 2.6.2-rc1-mm3 and
see what happens.

Here's my .config for 2.6.2-rc1-mm3:
