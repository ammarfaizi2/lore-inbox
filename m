Hi,

I saw strange thing in my friend computer, ; that is
the HD (hard disk) light lits all the times. Is it
normal behavior? Is it safe for the hard disk?

It is a Pentium S 100Mhz CPU, and PIIX3 disk
controller. This doesn't happen if I use 2.4.12-ac2
and I believe the same for all 2.4.x. But with 2.2.19
it doesn't happen like that in my machine (PIIX4)

Pls cc me as I am off the list. 

Thanks
