Sorry folks,  sometimes my coding faults produce spectacular goofups.

Today a brain-fart caused email delivery to hang up, and its first
correction attempt(*) caused smallish messages to duplicate message
content.   Slowdown would have been nothing, but that duplication...

*) I really should not do attempts, only use Correct Code,
   but these beasts are not always trivial, nor are my
   testbeds as serious loaders, as VGER's normal operation..
   (Thus "it is perfect"-code isn't that at vger...)
