Dave and Linus cc-ed me on the vger crackdown discussions and I offered 
to unsubscribe from the kernel list if it would help.  Dave's comment was
that I don't start the wars, which is probably true.  I tend to respond
to attacks, not go looking for fights.  I'd be curious to know when it is
that you think I've started a flame fest here, Alan.

I'm here for two reasons, I like OS topics and I want to support BK.
That latter one is a problem, the same character traits which make
me want to help people when they have problems are the ones that make
me participate in the BK flames.  If the kernel community is ready to
operate on a lower level of support from us, I'll bow out.  It hasn't
been pleasant being here for the last couple of years and I'd prefer 
to be gone.
