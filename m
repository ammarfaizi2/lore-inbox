Andres,

considering that your kernels' purpose is to provide a stabler base than
mainline to people who still want to stay close to mainline, I think that
your announces bring some real value here.

What does not have its place here are the announces of full-featured
patchsets not targetted at developpers nor testers.

Cheers,
Willy
