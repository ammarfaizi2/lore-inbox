It's perfectly fine that you are not able to test the fix.  But being
so visibly angry about it, that's the part I don't get.

How about a "I'm not able to test this due to lack of access to the
necessary hardware, but I did give it a try although unsuccessful.
Perhaps someone else can lend a hand so we can resolve this for good?"

That's the "calm" response.
