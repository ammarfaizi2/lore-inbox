I wasn't actually changing it to add performance, but to make the code look
cleaner. The new load_pointer() is virtually the same as having the seperate
functions that are currently there, but the code, I think, is "better looking".
If you look at the current net/core/filter.c and then my patched version, the
steps are done in the exact same order and same way, but all in that one
function.

That may sound silly, but I just kept looking at it and asking myself, "Why?"

Of course, one way may still out-perform the other.


Thanks
