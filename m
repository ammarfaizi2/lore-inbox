>From the Author

I spent years getting to know our founders. Most men are diminished by =
such=20
scrutiny, but in this case respect grew with understanding. As I read o=
ur=20
forefathers=92 words, I realized they overcame or foresaw most of our c=
urrent=20
problems.

What would our founders think of America today?

The answers are more conclusive than you might think.
