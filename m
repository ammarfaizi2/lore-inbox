Could you please put all of the changes in kernel/power/extents.c into one
patch? Â It's quite difficult to review them now, at least for me.

Well, I think similar remarks will apply to the other series of patches too, so
I won't repeat them if you don't mind.  [Also I won't be able to have a look
at the other patches today.  I'll do my best to review them in the next couple
of days.]

Greetings,
Rafael
