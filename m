Well Alan's kernel is quickly becoming Linus' which will be Marcelo's not
long after that.

So, I'd say try out Linus' 2.4.15-pres or wait for 2.4.15 final and see
how they work for you.  Cause this is where 2.4 is at now, and if it
doesn't work well for you, people need to know.

Other than that, any of the late 2.4s should work fine on that board.
