If that is what you meant, then we had no issue.

It looked like you were referring to Immunix because, in the quoted 
text, one paragraph only discussed Immunix (by name) and then the 
subsequent paragraph just said "them" and then talked about patents. 
There was no mention of SCC.

So even if you meant SCC, the casual reader only saw "Immunix" followed 
by "patents", and would infer the obvious.
