Keith,

No single method is perfect. Your point is well taken. 

The goal was to greatly reduce, in one swell foop, the volume of spam that
the filters (and postmaster) must interactively deal with. I thought that
perhaps this method could replace one of more of the troublesome filtering
techniques to achieve the same net spam reduction without evoking as much
whining.

imperfect != pointless

Matti, 
Roughly what percentage of the spam actually hitting vger today (and
bouncing off) is based on Keith's flavor of spoofing? Is it even 1 percent? 

Cheers,
Ed
