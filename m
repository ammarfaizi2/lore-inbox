Dear friend,

It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter, which I believe will
be a surprise, as we are both complete strangers. As you read this, I
don't want you to feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will die
someday.

My name is Al Muntaha, Ahmed Salah , a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I
have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer which was discovered very late,
due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according
to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business.  Though I
am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and
only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for, but now
I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just
wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when I have
a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way
from how I have lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have willed and
given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family
members and as well as a few close friends.

To correct my wrong past life, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on
earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in
the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so
badly, I cannot do this my self anymore.  I once asked members of my
Family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money, which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, which they claimed
have been distributed but without any detail information.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be honest and had
never visited me again.The last of my money which no one knows of is the
huge cash deposit of Eighteen million dollars that I have with a storage
company in South Africa, I will want you to help me collect this deposit
and dispatched it to charity organizations and you must be sending me
information of how it was disbursed either by email or otherwise.

I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.

Regards,

Al Muntaha, Ahmed Salah.
