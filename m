Greetings.

>From what I able to find from some searching around, the implementation
by MCLX ("http://oss.missioncriticallinux.com/projects/mcore/") is being
carried on at http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Feb/0987.html.

Looking at these patches, I can only see x86 architecture support for
in memory kernel crash dump support. Is anyone actively working on the
PowerPC architecture?

Best regards,
-Arun.
