This ugly shift was already removed in the current version
in linux-sound bk.  The l_port and r_port point the iomem pointers now
on cs4281 like others.  I don't know why the author of cs4281
implemented in such a way.

BTW, all __iomem fixes are already there, too.

Yes, it'd be definitely better.
Will work on it.
