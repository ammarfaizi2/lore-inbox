Oh wow, people and their arguments now get to be judged on this mailing list
because of their revenue stream???

I'm certainly not going to start discussing how much I make and where
it comes from, but I can assure you that RTAI is currently not part
of my revenue stream and that I'm making a very good living without
it.

Again, I sell 0$ of software.

But all this is total crap Larry and, for what's it's worth, I find
your comments quite insulting.

I like real-time and embedded software and enjoy working on it. The
fact that I'd like to see more of it being done with Linux is really
a desire to be working on the best of everything I like: Linux,
real-time and embedded.

Thanks Larry, that's really helpful. Instead of finding actual arguments,
researching the mailing lists, asking potential rt users, doing
some background checks, and trying out the software, all you can find
to say is that you "fail to see how raising a stink here is going to
help" me.

Forget about who I am and forget about what I do and please don't take
my word for anything I wrote. Ask around. Try posting your questions to
the following lists and see what you get or even try the archives:
rtl-advocacy@rtlinux.org
rtai@rtai.org

It seems that the LKML prefers to ignore the issue. Fair enough. I
did my part, I conveyed the worries of the rest of real-time Linux
community. My own personnal future is certainly not at stake here,
but Linux's is.

Thanks anyway Larry,

Karim
