The problem is not what people should be running. The kernels people are 
actually running are relevant. Any kernel on a CD sold in the last ~3 years 
is run and bug reports will arrive.
If you choose to ignore anything but the latest standard kernels you loose a 
large number of testers and bugs will go unnoticed longer.
