I don't intend to make announcements on a regular basis, but -ar2 is out for
2.6.7-rc3, with submount and some scheduler improvements. Since everyone
seems to be looking in the directory I posted earlier, I should probably
mention that http://hobbs.dynup.net/patches/ is holding new releases in the
obvious way. I'm still hunting for any other patches that improve user
experience, especially for desktop users, but I think I like where I am so
far, and that it's quite easily maintainable at this point.
