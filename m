Hi.

Some of my fellow students and I, have started a project in which we 
have to implement a linux driver for a CANbus ISA card ( AROS: A-858D 
PCCAN -x ver. 1.12).

Does there exist any work on a CANBus driver for linux already?

Also, is there any interrest for this kind of driver, or would something 
like this end up on a useless outdated website?


Any comments welcome.

Thanks in advance.
