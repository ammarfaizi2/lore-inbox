no, that implies that desktop/media is somehow opposed to other development.
that's the real issue: is there some reason to believe that this opposition
exists, that tuning for desktop/media is tuning away from other serverish
uses?  people like Linus want to push the agenda that the same kernel can 
do both, until there's some definitive proof otherwise.

how do you show this?  measured how, under what load, with what benefits?

this normally shows only that windows drivers are better.
