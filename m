Ok I hoped people would be smart enough to figure, but let me rephrase in two
ways:

  Many unices generate "\x1b" (^[) for ESC, which is also generated by
  keys like "up", which generates "\x1b[A" (^[[A)

  And QB generates "\x1b" (^[) while "up" generates "\x00H" (^@H).


Hope this makes things more clear - I interchangably used the ^ and the \
notation. Sorry if that confused anyone.
