I was compiling Linux 2.6.5 with -mjb1 patch, trying to get as small kernel as 
possible. I got an error:
<code>
  CC      mm/vmscan.o
mm/vmscan.c: In function `refill_inactive_zone':
mm/vmscan.c:650: `swapper_space' undeclared (first use in this function)
mm/vmscan.c:650: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
mm/vmscan.c:650: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [mm/vmscan.o] B??d 1
make: *** [mm] B³±d 2
</code>

I had changed the file mm/vmscan.c at line 649 from:
<code>
		app_centile = 100 - ((i.freeram + get_page_cache_size() -
			swapper_space.nrpages) / (i.totalram / 100));
</code>
to:
<code>
#ifdef CONFIG_SWAP
		app_centile = 100 - ((i.freeram + get_page_cache_size() -
			swapper_space.nrpages) / (i.totalram / 100));
#else /* CONFIG_SWAP */
		app_centile = 100 - ((i.freeram + get_page_cache_size()) / (i.totalram / 
100));
#endif /* CONFIG_SWAP */
<code>
Then it compiled (and even worked).
