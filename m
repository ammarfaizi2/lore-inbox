        Hate to be an old bugger and bring this up again, but I just had this 
old problem show up again, with 2.5.1-dj3. The scoop:

        Fired up xplaycd, played a coupla CDs. hit the eject button on 
xplaycd, and start to get hit with:

Dec 20 03:03:16 bellicha kernel: D REQ_BLOCK_PC 
Dec 20 03:04:27 bellicha kernel: D REQ_BLOCK_PC 

        in /var/adm/messages. Tried using /usr/bin/eject, in which 'ps waux'
gives me:

bradl    11866  0.0  0.2  2388 1036 vc/1     D    Dec19   0:00 xplaycd
root     15481  0.0  0.0  1212  348 ?        D    02:46   0:00 eject

bradl    15545  0.0  0.2  2388 1032 vc/1     D    02:48   0:00 xplaycd

        All of these are unkillable. ctrl-c does no good, and the drive is 
locked. I can safely bounce this box, as it's my personal one, but I thought 
I'd give this as a heads up. My setup:

Linux bellicha 2.5.1-dj3 #2 Tue Dec 18 18:15:48 PST 2001 i686 unknown

gcc-2.95.3
binutils 2.11.90.0.19
make 3.79.1

        This *IS* reproducible. See attached for config.

                                                        BL.
