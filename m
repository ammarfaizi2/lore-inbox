Regarding the JACK problem, it seems that the incompatibility with
NPTL (SCHED_INHERIT is default) did wrong.


Taking a look through the thread, I feel that very different topics
are argued in the single "desktop" problem, namely, the interactivity
and the latency.  The latter, the problem of real-time audio
(e.g. JACK), must be irrelevant with the CPU scheduler.  It can 
be fixed by detecting the too long critical sections, but the fix
won't always improve the interactivity.

OTOH, the interactivity can be, and should be improved somehow with
tuning of CPU scheduler.  However, even about this word, we discuss
totally different meanings.  For example, the GUI response and the
fluent audio/video playback.  The improvement of the former doesn't
imply the improvement of the latter (often contradictorily)...
