	Compiling and linking are mechanical, but unless you want to argue that the
result is not a single work, it clearly creates a derivative work of all the
things linked. The creativity is not in the linking itself but in the
creation of the individual works such that they can be linked together.

	There is no legal distinction. Your rights come not from the fact that you
paid money for the work but simply from the fact that you acquired it
legally. Again, the reductio ad absurdum is the guy who drops copies of his
poem from an airplane and then demands royalities from everyone who reads
it. If you legally acquired it, you get the bundle of rights under first
sale.

	Yes, but this doesn't restrict first sale or fair use. You cannot use a
library without creating a derivative work, so if first sale grants you
rights to use, it automatically grants you the right to do anything
necessary for use.

	Sometimes I wonder if you are reading what I said or not. I said "you need
to produce a derivative work to use the work in the ordinary fashion" and
you say "No" and follow with an example where you clearly *don't* need to
produce a derivative work to use the work in the ordinary fashion.

	You are free to disagree with the FSF's interpretation of the GPL, but you
are not free to misrepresent the FSF's interpreration.

	Feel free to disagree with the FSF about the meaning of the GPL, but it is
the FSF's position that you can modify a GPL'd work without agreeing to the
GPL.

	I don't know who "we" is, but I agree with the FSF.

	Right. You cannot increase the number of copies.

	You can, so long as you don't increase the number of copies. This is a
right under first sale.

	To use a library, you must write a program that uses that libraries and
includes its header files. You must compile the library and the program, and
link the result. You must then execute the result.

	You can argue it one of two ways:

	1) The result is a derivative work, hence creating a derivative work is
necessary for ordinary use. Thus permission to use means permission to
create (at least some) derivative works.

	2) The result is not a derivative work, hence you don't need permission
from the copyright holder to do it.

	Either way you get the same result, permission is not needed beyond
permission to use.

	Then all the people who think that creating a binary kernel module requires
creating a derivative work and hence can be restricted by the GPL are wrong.
Take that argument up with them.

	I think even if the result is not a derivative work, the rules for
distributing it would be the same. However, it would change the rules for
creating it. Either way, however, you get that you can do it without
agreeing to the GPL, and this is the FSF's position.
