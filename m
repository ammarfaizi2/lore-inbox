I expect to have 16-32 CPUs in my $3000 desktop in 5 years .  If you all 
start planning for that now, you might get it debugged before it happens 
to me.;-)

I don't expect to connect the 16-32 CPUs with ethernet.... but it won't 
surprise me if they have non-uniform memory.

 It is just a matter of time before the users need Reiser4 to be highly 
scalable, and I don't want to rewrite when they do, so we are worrying 
about it now.
