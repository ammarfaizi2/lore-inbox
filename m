That's also my experience: 

- I have been on all major automation trade shows in Germany for about 5
  years

- I am the author of one of the two German books about Embedded Linux and
  of lots of articles about Linux for automation 

- I have organized the largest developer conference in Germany about "Linux
  for industrial applications" 

During all that activities I have talked to hundrets of people who are
either already working with Linux or considering it's use. What Karim says
here does exactly reflect the mood of the people.
