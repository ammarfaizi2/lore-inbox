I run a small ISP for my local community and have read some reports about
hotmail not supporting it et al.  I don't want to be in a position where MY
site doesn't support this if it's the correct thing to do.

Is there anything special that needs to be done (cisco router config,
firewall (ie, checkpoint)) to allow this information to pass?
