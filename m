Dear C .e .o/President,

I am a registered Financial Security Agent of the FSA (Financial
Services Authority) in the UK, attached to the department of Treasury. 
Arising from the Continuous Admittance of New Counties/Member into the 
merging 
EU(European Community is a recent directive from the Bank of England 
that all 
dormant account be redirected into Government archives. I have been in 
charge 
of a particular Dormant/Suspense account which no one from my very 
professional investigation using the extensive data protection 
database.

This bond has been in a dormant state since 2000 and the department 
has 
been changing custodian of the bonds for the past three (3)years. What 
is 
needed at this stage is to find a very reliable, confidential and 
responsible 
friend who would assist me in the claims of these bonds without it 
reverting 
to the state. In this case, i would initiate a systematic transfer of 
the 
said bonds into a Dedicated Account opened in your name or company 
name, 
whichever you find most appropriate. I would therefore need your 
response in 
order to grant you access to the detailed facts and figures of the 
bond. I 
have been able to contact you based on information retrieved from the 
credit 
reference database attached to my institution. I will be most willing 
to go into 
partnership with you to see this project completed in earnest.


I assure you that there would be no issues to your name or person. All
you would be required to do is to open an offshore account for this 
purpose. I hope you understand why I cannot disclose exclusive data to 
you at 
this stage. Do kindly respond to me via my email address below or my 
fax 
number. Upon this, I would be able to send you more details regarding 
this 
project. If I do not hear from you in the next few days, I would 
assume you are 
not interested but if you are, do also provide a phone/fax numbers you 
could be reached on. I look forward to an excellent business 
relationship 
with you.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr.Peter Wallace
Financial Service Authority (FSA).
