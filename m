I wish to report a major failure.
with 2.4.16 and 2.4.17-pre8
on PII-450 x2 SMP system, Gigabyte BXDS board
(has adaptec scsi chip on it)
using IDE disk, scsi tape (DDS-4)

My system boots to X.
I swap to VC1 and start tarring up a lot of mp3's.

It works fine if i leave it to complete.

If I go to X and then back to VC1, the system will lock solid.
No num lock, no magic sysreq, no ping.

snuffed it. BRS time.

It's 100% reproducible and I can't figure out anything useful
to say except "HELP"

Thank god for journalling filesystems.
and hans and stephen.

I'm not subscribed, please cc me anything.

.config and dmesg attached.

Regards
