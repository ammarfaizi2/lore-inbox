Hello

I am hoping someone can give me a little information or point me in the
right direction.  I would like to write an application that monitors I/O
on a linux machine, but I need some help in determining where to get the
information I'm looking for.  What I would like to do is 'hook' into the
kernel and record information such as volume name, type of request (read
or write), the amount of data being read or written, how long each
transaction takes.... =20

Any help would be greatly appreciated, or if there is something like
this already available that would be even better.  Thanx

Mike
