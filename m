Anybody care to venture an opinion why a menu for "Fusion MPT Device Support" 
shows up between SCSI and Firewire in the main menu of make menuconfig, but I 
can't get into it?  I press enter and the main menu just redraws.  My .config 
is attached.  (Never hand-hacked, but carried forward from...  2.4.7, I 
think.)

I'm fairly certain my laptop hasn't got this hardware, but it's been like 
this for a while and I'm curious.

Oh, and there's no help entries for any of the new kernel hacking stuff, or 
the new serverworks he/le agpgart support, or PNPBios support under plug and 
pray...  I'll go bug Eric.

Nothing to actually stop me from compiling it, of course.  (In progress...)
