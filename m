You snipped the part I was actually interested in.  Let me try again.

We're agreed that the files themselves are the best indicator of where to
route patches, and that MAINTAINERS isn't useful for much besides deciding
who should get IPO offers ;-).  What I'm wondering is where I, as someone
who is listed in some of the Documentation/* stuff as its maintainer, should
be sending patches.  You want a hierarchy, and I think that's perfectly
reasonable, but I have no idea who the layer of the hierarchy between me and
you is....

later,
chris
