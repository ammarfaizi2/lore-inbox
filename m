So, then, just to satisfy my curiosity, how long until users of Linux in
the U.S.A. will no longer be allowed to download new kernels?

After all, all it would really take for one of us to find out what was
fixed is to download this patch and go through it line by line, and
examine the context of the changes.

Or are we no longer allowed to look at the sources either?

I'm really confused by this gesture.  You're talking about both sides of
your mouth by telling us that "US kernel developers cannot be told" and at
the same time releasing the source/patch to the world.

Make up your mind.

I guess I was wrong about the Linux kernel being Open Source and freely
available and distributable.
