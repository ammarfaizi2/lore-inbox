I think John's idea was that the email is not really important, as long as
the diffs themselves could be made available via URLs. That sounds good. I
only asked for the Message-ID because it didn't occur to me there might be
a straighter path to the diff.

I'm trying to deal with cases where the only changelog comment is
something like:

"kbuild: Hand merge link order change form driverfs update."

I know who did it. I know when it was accepted into the tree. I can spend
awhile grepping megabytes of lmkl archives (and come up empty, in this case),
but after that I have to give up. The patch is pretty much simply unavailable
at that point.

A URL to the diff itself would make it trivial to delve deeper into the
meaning behind changelog entries. Currently, investigating each entry just
takes way too much time, and often leads nowhere. If you can automate it
easily at your end, it would make a big difference to anyone studying
kernel development.

Be well,
Zack
