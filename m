If the license says the receipient of a piece of code must acknowledge 
and protect the trade secrets it contains, then it's enforceable.  We trump
state courts on the grounds of sovereinty, so a state court isn't able 
to reverse one of our courts unless there's a question of Federal Law.

The Federal Courts can in vary narrow areas reverese our courts, but since
this license represents a consentual commerical transaction with an 
Indian Nation, most folks will have to appeal to the US supreme court 
to get this reversed -- the Federal Courts are bound by the constitutional
provisions regarding sovereignty.  Makes Open Source code very easy to protect
in state courts under existing Trade Secrete law, and yes, this is 
a modified version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.  Please note 
the use of the word "individual" in the test.  


The comments from folks are very good an helpful.
