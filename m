I recently have been receiving mails with"sexy screensavers", what is so dodgy, is that hotmail doesn't pick it up.

Cheers, Dean McEwan. Currently hacking KGI, which I don't understand, oh and ask me about OpenModemTalk...

   In the for what it is worth department, I got mail from "esr@thyrus.org"
   with a subject of "cool game" or something like that, and it was obviously
   forged.  It's interesting that they are getting smart enough to make it look
   like it comes from someone that you've communicated with in the past.  Sigh.

There is someone basically forging email from anyone prominent
in the opensource community.  I've even got these forges myself
addressed as from myself which is even more amusing :-)

So I think rather it is this clown instead of someone figuring out
who you've had email with recently.
