Cute Blonde Big Melons Masturbating

A paranoiac, like a poet, is born, not made.
America is not a young land: it is old and dirty and evil before the settlers, before the Indians. The evil is there waiting.Life is like Sanskrit read to a pony.
What I like about cities is that everything is king size, the beauty and the ugliness.Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.Some men are so lazy they won't even feed themselves.
Journalism is organized gossip.A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one.
