Explicit CC request + self-CC the e-mail sent to the list in most cases
will suffice. As far as TB is concerned this also needs 'Reply All' to
be used but self-cc seems to me semantically more logical. Especially in
the case Jasper has given when he sends a mail to LKML from a different
place (work) than he receives it.

I may agree that.

What I am really against is the dogmathic point of view presented in the
document about RT header that is linked from the FAQ.
