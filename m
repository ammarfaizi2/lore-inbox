The lkml FAQ is aimed at users, not developers. The bitkeeper and the 
SubmittingPatches document are aimed at developers. I see a fundamental 
difference here...

The fact that some developers use bitkeeper has no effect on other 
developers. Well ok, it means that the bk using developers can work faster 
but that is not at issue here...

I don't see why there should be any kind of split or anything like that. 
Everything continues as before. It's just that some developers now have a 
much easier life...
