Dear readers of this maillinglist,

I'm most of the time very happy that there is Linux (special thanks to 
Linus T.) and that i'm one happy computer user that isn't confronted all 
the time with a special blue screen.

I'm a user from the time kernel 2.0.xx started and yes it's not from the 
start but it's still a long time....

I'm almost very happy with the things that are going on in kernel land. 
And yes not all things that work in Wintendo aka Winboot will work under 
linux. But there are a few things that always worked very well. 
Including webcams. (yes i can stay polite and be nice but that won't 
have the effect i want....)

Now my dear daughter has her own laptop and she insists to run linux on 
it. She just had her birthday and she got a nice logitec webcam so she 
can use it on that very stable system.

BUT NO!!

These days she can't anymore. Why ?? Because there's a problem between 
hrh Greg Kroah (usb maintainer) and somebody who did his best to give 
user the possibility of using a goodworking webcam.

I don't want the discussion if it's proper or not to have that driver in 
the kernel. I have just the problem that i have todo more before it works...

I realy don't give a sh*t about that. I just want one thing and that is 
that the webcam starts working again and work like in ASAP. Rather 
yesterday then today.

So here's a user yrh Greg Kroah that realy wants that driver back in. 
I'm a user and i'm not alone! There are more users like me and what we 
want is that we have hardware which should work with the os we choose. 
We choose linux because it's stable and it's not wintendo. Are you gonna 
decide for us what we want ?? I hope not coz history tells us that those 
kind of people never last long...

So what about it are you going to help me? And make it possible for us 
to use our choosen hardware?


I realy hope you listen to me / us because I / we choose linux above 
windows...


Regards,

Gabriel Kenter
