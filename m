Ok, im 16 and looking at heading into uni as soon as ive finished year 12.
I'm gonna head on over to uni, i am wondering out of curiosity what courses most kernel developers have done? im going to do either bachelour of computer science, or information technology, at a later date, when im done my studies im hoping to help with kernel developing, mozilla etc. etc., so i was wondering what people would consider the course that gives you "kernel development" sort of skillset-mindset
any feedback is appriciated, please CC it to my mail adress at arevill@bigpond.net.au 

Kind Regards and Cheers
Peter Revill
