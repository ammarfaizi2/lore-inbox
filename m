I would recommend UNIX Network Programming - Networking APIs: Sockets
and XTI, and UNIX Network Programming - Interprocess Communications both
by (the late and great) W. Richard Stevens.  They are big, thick, very
detailed and have lots of example code.  A list of his books are at
http://www.kohala.com/start/#books.  None of them are especially for
Linux, but they mostly apply except for where they don't.  Good Luck.

Bob
