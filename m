I agree with Alan - this is the key question.  

I would further argue that silence in response to this question
suggests that there was no carefully considered reason;
presumably a good hacker just followed the spec, without considering how
these CDs are actually used.

It further suggests to me that I should prep a patch.

Thoughts?  Screams of protest?  Helpful tips on to whom I
should send the patch?

Thanks,

Jer
