I try hard not to feed the trolls or engage in advocacy on this list, but 
this time I can't resist supplying a quote from your mail headers:

    X-MSMail-Priority: Normal
    X-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook IMO, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2911.0)
    X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V6.00.2600.0000

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're really just a 
half-deprogrammed dual-booter[1] rather than a genuine troll, so consider 
this please:  Linux is less vulnerable to worm attacks because our security 
is an open process in which everybody participates.  End of story.

Note that this does not give us any reason to relax: it's a process, it has 
to continue.

If you must debate this further could you please respond privately.

[1] It's not a reason to be ashamed, many of us have been there
