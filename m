Its okay with me to add more states _when they are needed_. Just now,
many drivers do not even handle system suspend/resume correctly.

We are not adding random crap to kernel just because "someone may need
it". And yes, having aliases counts as "random crap". Perfectly legal
but totally useless things count as a random crap, too.

Bring example hardware that needs more than two states, implement
driver support for that, and then we can talk about adding more than
two states into core code.
