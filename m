The commits lists currently only accept posts from dwmw2@hera, I
believe. That can relatively easily be changed if the mail is going to
come from somewhere else.

I did ask Linus to let me know as soon as possible when he starts to
commit patches, so we can come up with a way to keep the list fed. Since
he thinks I'm James, however, I suspect that part of the message didn't
get through. Perhaps he was just distracted by the Britishness?
