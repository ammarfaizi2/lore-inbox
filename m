Yes, but the latter paper was the real milestone. This was the guy who
actually defined what information *is*, and found out the upper limits
of communication rates on a given channel. This was the guy who laid
the fundaments of the information theory. Without information theory no
compression, reliable transmission, reliable storage, crypthography,
etc.
