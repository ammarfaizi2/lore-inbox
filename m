	First, you are too US-centric.

	Second, if this is only what is allowed, then we are living in
a kind of a surreptitious world police state.  Not a free world by any
means.  In this circumstances, I will consider any clone attempt a
honourable act of civil disobedience necessary for the long-term
survival of humankind, barring the Second Coming.

	Now, your interpretations of others' words are certainly
self-serving.  If I define a clone as a workalike, one has to do no
reverse engineering.  It would suffice to do the same tasks, and use
your own interoperability stuff to get data back and forth.

	Not only self-serving, but libellous.  With each word you
expose even more the evil.

	Even if I can't agree him on political or moral subjects, in
this instance RMS acted exactly as I expected, and I praise him for
it.  I hope he's proud for it, but not proud enough as to damage his
philosophy even more.
