We have the same sort of thing here. Technically, anyone who D/L the software believing that it was perfectly legal to do so and having no intent to harm Novell
or steal their proprietary information, could not be prosecuted. They could be ordered to stop using it and get rid of (destroy) all copies, and thereafter if
they were caught with it they could be prosecuted. But, in actuality - and this stands for any country with any laws - Novell can do what ever they want to
those who have the software unless the courts decide not to let them.

I think people shouldn't marry until 40! (J/K, I have two young daughters ;)
