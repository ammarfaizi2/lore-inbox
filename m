   The economic inertia of Java driven server applications should have
   enough force that it is justifyable to RedHat and other commerical
   organizations to support it regardless of what your current view is
   on this topic.

So they'll get paid to implement and support it, and that is precisely
what is happening right now.  And the whole point I'm trying to make
is that that is where it's realm is right now.

If AIO was so relevant+sexy we'd be having threads of discussion about
the AIO implementation instead of threads about how relevant it is or
is not for the general populace.  Wouldn't you concur?  :-)

The people doing Java server applets are such a small fraction of the
Linux user community.
