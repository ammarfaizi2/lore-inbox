Hi all,

I keep getting the following error in the logs. Can someone tell me what 
it means. It started when I put 2.4.0test10-pre6. I upgraded to 2.4.0-test10
last night and I got it again this morning. If you need more info just let me
know and I will provide it. I am not sure what would be revelant.
