Yes, they were. Because they have helped to create a working driver, which 
is more than can be said about the other cam brands I tried last week but 
had to return.

And also because the NDA has expired, and Philips might be willing to open 
up more now.

You talk to the wrong person. I completely agree, and used pretty much 
these exact words a while ago. Companies should want to make the best 
products, and this whole NDA/patent/driver game is just holding back the 
whole industry's advance and it degrades the very products they claim to 
be so proud of. How can anyone make a good product, and not want see it 
work?

Too many lawyers, too little engineers.

Ofcourse.
