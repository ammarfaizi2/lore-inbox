I just checked with vanilla 2.6.5 and the virtual /dev/input/mice 
(and /dev/psaux) indeed work as advertised. The problem, as I thought would 
be, is with XFree and it's incredible bad mouse handling. The XFree code is 
so bad I don't wanna touch it, but someone ought to write a driver for the 
event device so that we wouldn't need the PS/2 emulation anymore.
