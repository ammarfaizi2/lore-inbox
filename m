Bryan Sparks (who left Caldera years back and bought DRDOS from Canopy) 
owns DRDOS and
not SCO. Bryan also supports Linux and always has. Bryan also is the 
person who backed M$
into a corner and stopped them from crushing planet earth. He's one of 
the biggest friends Linux has
and was pushing Linux in the early 1990s. Caldera and Canopy do not deal 
in DRDOS anymore.
