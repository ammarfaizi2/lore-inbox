oh, sound_core.c is not the OSS driver ;)

it looks nice and easy.  i'll do that for all pci drivers, too, once
when these patches are merged.

not only pci but also isapnp devices can provide dev pointer.
in that case, should the driver gives symlinks of each isapnp devices,
too?  a module usually holds one isapnp card struct and several isapnp
devices below it.  but, hmm, it will need far more codes...
