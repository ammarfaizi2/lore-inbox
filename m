OK, I have heard that other people have been having this problem for a while 
now, but I havent been able to find much about what causes it. I have a 
Western Digital hard drive in my computer (60GB, 5400 RPM) I can use it just 
fine with no DMA, but it runs much faster with DMA. However, when I use DMA, 
all my data is slowly corrupted, and I begin having to re-install packages 
all the time. After about a month, my system deteriorates to the point where 
I have to reinstall slackware. I have no idea why this is happening, but I 
know some people who have had the same experience under Linux with Western 
Digital hard drives, but not with other brands. I am assuming this is a 
problem with Western Digital's implimentation of DMA, but shouldnt it do 
something to prevent errors?

Thanks.

Never tell a lie unless it is absolutely convenient.
