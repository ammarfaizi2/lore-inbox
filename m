Dear Sir,

IN DESPERATE NEED OF YOUR CO-OPERATION!
 
I write you this letter to solicit your help from Prison, as I am in dire
need. I am Kelly 
White, a Captain in The ROYAL ARMY deployed to help facilitate the forceful
change 
of the Sadam HUSSEIN Regime in Iraq. I have been serving in Iraq since the
beginning 
of the war. I was previously attached to a British Military Base in Germany
before 
my deployment to Iraq. I do hope you are not confused and distracted by
the fact 
that a strange person is writting you in confidence. 
In the course of my stay in Iraq,I have withnessed so much looting from
which many
colleagues have benefited (in excess of some Billions of Dollars)and we
have also 
benefit from. I decided that I cannot afford to be left out of this great
opportunity to 
become a success, after a long hesitation. 
This money is a part of the money that the regime of Sadam Hussein,their
friends and 
cronies had stolen and hidden in various parts of Iraq before the war.It
was now the 
responsibility of the U.S and British soldiers to search for,recover this
money and plough
back into the governance of Iraq. In the proccess,we were able to keep some
away for 
ourselves. Thats how the money came about.
Everything went well until I was accused arrested in 2004 alongside other
colleagues 
suspected to have abused inmates of prisons under the control of Allied
Forces in Iraq.
I initially thought that my stay in prison awaiting trial would be brief
but I have spent some 
months here without any change in my hopeless situation! Now that I don´t
know how 
long I would stay here,and faced with the possibility of dismissal from
the Army if I am 
found guilty,I have come to reason that it is only proper to try and make
some kind of 
reliable contact who could help me pick up and safe-keep this money so that
I don´t lose 
everything I have saved during my stay in Iraq.Who knows;such an opportunity,they
say, 
comes once in a lifetime!
My friends who did it before advised me that I just needed a contact (any
contact) outside 
Iraq to assure me that he could handle such an amount of money,after which
I would order 
it to be sent through for safe-keeping. I have (hidden safely in Iraq) presently,the
sum 
of US$21.7m. I only need you,Sir,to guarantie me that I can still get this
money back,if it is 
remitted to you. I only need a person I can trust to safeguard this money
since it is not possible 
to leave here and do it myself. All the arragerment to transfer it to you
has been made by me 
before my arrest.Your only part is to receive and safeguard it. We would
further discuss on 
how the money should be disbursed afterwards.
For your role in this business,I wish to compensate you handsomely on successful
conclussion 
of this assignment.I must only not forget to tell you that secrecy and confidentiality
in this 
business is very important to both parties. It could put us in serious danger
and even compound 
my already complex problem, if this information is leaked to a third party!It
is therefore a matter 
of great importance to keep this secret strictly between us even after the
successful conclussion 
of this transaction. I did not include my phone contact because any other
contact is for the military 
prison and therefore,tapped.This e-mail is the only private contact I have
here.
I implore you to consider this proposal as urgently as possible and give
me a feedback. If you are 
in favour of my proposal,please,do include your PRIVATE contact information
- phone,fax,e-mail 
to facilitate a more effective and confidential communication.
I implore you to ponder over this proposal as urgently as possible and get
back to me.
Do not forget to pray fervently for my acquitance.I wish you the best as
I await your reply.
Thanks,
Best Regards,
Kelly White(Capt).
