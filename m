Depends, do you want to get the job done or play with drivers?

If the former then get yourself to eBay and buy a brand new PS/2 barcode reader
for circa $10-$20 that plugs between the ps/2 port and the keyboard and 'just
works' (I use mine to enter ISBN numbers into a database).

It'll probably arrive before you can finish typing another Iliad^H^H^H^email ;)

PS I think for just a couple of $ you can even get serial to PS/2
pass-thru/converter cables.

Dunno if these will work with your scanner.
