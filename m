Dear All,

I'd like to apologise to the LKML and especially to
Patrick Mansfield amd Mike Andersom.

I'm very sorry that I allowed that outbust to go to the list,
it shames me to see it thrown back at me.

I will be making positive changes to myself and would like
the priviledge to sit at the back and observe.

Thank you
johnf
