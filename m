<color><param>0100,0100,0100</param>After attempting different configurations for the past 3 hours, I am at a loss.  I have 
attempted to successfully load the 3C59x driver with kernel 2.4.6-pre5 and pre3 with 
no luck.  As soon as the module loads, I can switch consoles, but can type nothing into 
any of them.  I can hit the Num Lock, which will turn on and off the light, same with 
Caps Lock.  I can hit the return key in the terminal where the insmod command was 
given, and it will scroll the screen, nothing more.  I tried loading the module with 
debug=7, per the vortex.txt file, but nothing is logged anywhere.  I am at a loss as to 
what is the problem is here.  Any help is appreciated.  Attached is my .config file and 
output from dmesg.  I can try to provide any more info that might help.  I will also 
attache output from lspci, although, the TV card has been removed, as it was sharing an 
IRQ with the NIC, so I wanted to eliminate any possibility that this might be part of the 
problem.
