Shawn,

You can go download the IETF iSCSI working document.
You and anyone less can go write a driver to replace me.
I already stated, I will use another platform, like NetBSD if forced.
This is not hardware unless I decide to use a CAM card, then the wrapper
around the object in question becomes the GPL driver.

I originally asked you offline as not to add more noise, while I am
waiting to see what my peers who are the copyright holders have to say
about the issue.

Are you a copyright holder in the kernel today?
If so, I can tell you will object on the LGPL issue and deny.
Where is the files so I can evaluate my position now.

Regards,
