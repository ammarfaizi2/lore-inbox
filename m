Given a choice I prefer one list for patches and discussion.  Patches on a 
separate  list will eventually result in discussions of those patches on that 
list, and might even leave out interested parties out of the ensuing discussion.
My 2c;  If a separate patch list is needed for staging patches to mainline, it 
could be something like mm-commits - a broadcast only list by the
maintainer.

Thanks,
Kiran
