Dear Sir,
With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage
to contact you. I am from (will disclose this later), presently
working in Iraq with an international organisation that I will also
disclose later, I found your contact particulars in an address
journal,having read your profile as regards running funeral home successfully
i am as convince as to believe in your ability to help me out.
I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of
(US$10.523 Million Dollars) Ten Million five Hundred Thousand And
Twenty Three Dollars to your country or any other safe country of
your choice, as far as I can be assured that my share will be safe
in your care untill I complete my service here,this is no stolen
money, and there are no dangers involved.
SOURCE OF MONEY:
Some money in various currencies was discovered concealed in
barrels with piles of weapons and ammunitions at a location near
one of Saddam,s old palaces during a rescue operation, and it was
agreed by all party present that the money be shared amongst us,
this was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? no
compensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives
in this hell hole.
The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this
kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a German
contact working here, and his office enjoys some immunity, I was
able to get the package out to a safe location entirely out of
trouble spot. He does not know the real contents of the package,
and believes that it belongs to an Asian/American who died in an
air raid, and before giving up, trusted me to hand over the package
to his business associate. I have now found a secured way of
getting the package out to a safer country for you to pick up, and
will discuss this with you when I am sure that you are willing to
assist me.
One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this
matter with a third party, should you have reasons to reject this
offer, please destroy this mail as any leakage of this information
will be too bad for us.
I do not know for how long we will remain here, and I have survived
2 suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other
reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help,
I honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately. Please
contact me as soon as possible for full details.
Regards,
Mr Judges
