Why not take that a step further?  It would seem to me that your
insane interpretation of that insane law would mean that unix and it's
derivatives (Linux, anyone?) would be illegal to use as well.

You're preaching to the choir here.  By withholding these changes from US
citizens, you're not going to pressure any politicians.  I doubt there are
many politicians who count on this issue reading this list.  I think most
of the US citizens reading this list, though, are enlightened enough to
know the harm the DMCA causes.

Please don't tell me you woke up this morning and had a sudden attack of
conscience that you were violating US law.  You've posted such changes
here since the DMCA was put into effect, not to mention that lists like
Bugtraq are still operating in the US - and I think many of us managed to
read about the symlink and ptrace holes in kernels <= 2.2.19.
