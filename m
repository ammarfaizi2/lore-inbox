Hi,

I´m having problems with concurrent TCP/UDP connections in my machine and
wondered if there is a limit in Kernel of "how many connections can be open
simoultaneously".

If someone know something about limitations and how to tune it up about this
matter, please don´t forget to put my address in CC as I´m not a signer of
this list.

Thank you,


Fernando Netto
