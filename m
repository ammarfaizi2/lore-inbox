(1) would change core<->driver interface

(2) is quite a lot of work

(3) ...with very little benefit, until drivers support >2 states

I want to fix invalid values being passed down to drivers, not rewrite
half of driver model.

If you want to rewrite driver model for >2 states, great, but that is
going to take at least a year AFAICS, so please let me at least fix
the bugs in meantime.

I assumed we could fix the interface without actually introducing >2

I do not see such drivers around me, that's all. It seems fair to me
that first driver author wanting that is the one who introduces >2
states support to generic infrastructure.

...which seems like one more reason to only export "on" and "off" in
radeon case. We don't want userspace to write "D3" to radeon, then
wondering why it failed.

Passing "on"/"off" down to radeon lets the driver decide what power
state it should enter.
