You've got things a little out of perspective.

1. Linux does not serve Philips.
2. Philips does not serve Linux.

Can we agree on that much?

3. Linux's licensing (i.e., the GPL) does not allow partial 
closed-source drivers.

You can agree or disagree with that until your face falls off.  That is 
the way that it is.  Allowing a license violation to continue would set 
a bad precedent that goes beyond open-source dogma.  It has nothing to 
do with zealotry.  It *is* a legal issue.  You're not free to pick and 
choose the parts of the license you like or don't like.  Using a 
license, ANY license, is like being pregnant:  there is no half-way.

4. Philips serves *its* customers.

The logical conclusion is that, one way or another, Philips needs to 
make a driver available that is compatible with Linux's licensing.  It 
can do that or decide that it doesn't care about its customers that use 
Linux.  The license really doesn't leave room for a third option.

Further bickering about it here is an exercise in futility.
