The Config help for kernel automount indicates that the pointer to user
code is in the Documentation/Changes file for autofs. As far as I can tell
that isn't the case. Since search engines seem to be better at finding the
BSD and 2.2 software, it would be nice if the information was restored
with all the other "get it here info."
