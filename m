Extending the useful life of current hardware will shift profit even
further towards support contracts, and away from hardware sales.

Imagine the performance gain a webserver serving mostly static
content, with light database and scripting usage is going to see
moving from a 2.4 -> 2.6 kernel?  Zero copy and filesystem
improvements alone will extend it's useful life dramatically, in my
opinion.
