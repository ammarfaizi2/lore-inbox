Don't clauses (a) and/or (b) include provisions that mean Raphael takes
on this responsibility if he believes that CompuLab released the patch
under a suitable open source license? In particular the "to the best of
my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license" bit
in (b).

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or
       =20
        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the
        best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open
        source license and I have the right under that license to submit
        that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in
        part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in
        the file; or
       =20
        ...
