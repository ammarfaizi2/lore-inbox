Intel is pleased to announce the launch of an open source project to 
support the Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection miniPCI adapter 
(IPW2200).  The project site is up and in the coming weeks you can 
expect initial source to become available providing the foundation for 
supporting this hardware.

We are announcing to the LKML now as we value working with the Linux 
community and wanted to let you know directly that Intel has now 
officially started this project.

The project is hosted at http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net.  A development 
mailing list is available (linked from the top of the IPW2200 project 
page) so if you are interested in this project, go subscribe to the 
mailing list and/or set yourself up to monitor the file releases.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
James
