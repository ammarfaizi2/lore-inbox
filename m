This subject line seems to have attracted a bunch of odd legal 
misinformation, which as noted has been refuted by the courts. However, 
I do note that Microsoft is using the work Linux in their ads, and not 
putting on the trademark symbol. It is probably good for someone to look 
at that, because a trademark can be lost if it is not defended (think 
Kleenex or Asprin). The ads just have a note in tiny print saying 
something 'some of these words may be trademarks of their owners.' I 
believe if the owner notifies them they have to add the MT or (R) symbol 
and state the name of the holder.

Clearly I'm not a lawyer, but since there was a TV show about "lost 
trademarks" I'm pretty damn sure it can happen.

The GPL is alive and well at the moment, I hope the trademark is as well.
