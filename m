CMI8330 has a dual interface for SB and Adlib modes.  The mixer can
also behave differently according to the mode.  The current code has
mixer elements corresponding to both modes.

However, these mixer elements _seem_ to interactive with each other,
and cannot be controlled individually.  That's why ENABLE_SB_MIXER is
disabled.  I cannot check this issue any longer since the test board
got broken long time ago...

I don't think we would get many gain by changing this old code.
(and the relevant part isn't so big.)
Let's keep as it is.
