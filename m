Larry, please stop these over emotive reactions once and for all.

Threatened you are certainly not, and you seem to know it pretty well.  
Have more confidence, relax, laugh at BK clone attempts privately, and stop
pissing off people back since there is nothing _outrageous_ with a few folks
(hardly a "community" here) trying to convince themselves they can (or
cannot) do what you did.  Yes you are passionate about what you do and that's 
really a good thing.  Using that passion against others is not.

Your repetitive spinning of dust and stepping on anything that is years 
away from BK just give the impression that you fear
bankruptcy for tomorrow, yet you claim your superiority out loud. So please
get real and stop that nonsense.


Nicolas
