No (that's actually the cobfusion I don't fear).
The word "Linux" used as above has lots of different interpretations
depending on who you ask (from "Linux kernel" to "Linux distribution" to
"open source software" and I won't try to guess what sales people in
their average ignorance would answer).
"The Linux kernel" is not that much longer much more accurate.

Yes, directly (and only) here on LKML there is probably no problem. But
these mails are also in some mail archives on the web .....
