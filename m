Well, I don't speak for rms, and I think there is a rather big
difference between drivers and games.  I understand economic
motives.  Of course you don't give away games when that is a total
loss.  Giving away driver code (or at least programming specs)
wouldn't be a loss to nvidia though - because users would still
need to buy those cards.
