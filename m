I'd suggest something like:

Final Warning.  ECN is being turned on NOW.  If your firewall doesn't 
support ECN, this will be the last message that gets through to you from us.

Such a message will have the interesting characteristic of being the last 
message received.  This will make it obvious why no further messages are 
arriving.
