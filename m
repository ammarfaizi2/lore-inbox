Hey,
I've found a bug in 2.6.11.6. I have a Toshiba laptop and when i did run 2.6.11.6 my touchpad flipped out, it clicked everywhere when it wasn't supposed to click. I couldn't even move my mouse without it was clicking all over. It works fine i 2.6.10 though. Is there any changes made that can affect this? (I haven't tried 2.6.11.7 yet...)

Best regards,
Amelia Nilsson
