I want to upgrade from 2.2.16 to 2.4. I have Compaq Prosignia 300 with a
memory hole, which cannot be turned off. There was no problem with that on
2.2.16, I just put "mem=64M" to kernel as a boot option. It does not appear
to be functional on 2.4, I only finds 15MB. I use the same LILO v.21, rh6.2.

Please reply to trebi@post.cz,
Thanks,
Vladimir Trebicky
