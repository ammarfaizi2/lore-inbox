Nope.  Not at all.  Stay tuned, because I'll explain.

And before you write me off as one of the $BIGNUM clueless
visionaries, you might do well to remember that I actually *have*
radically changed the world lkml operates in.  At least twice.

In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession 
or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches 
in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the 
preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot 
say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear 
such an instrument. [...] The Militia comprised all males 
physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense.
