Joerg, if anyone involved in this entire discussion can be accused of being 
personally offensive, it's you.  As to "technically uninformed" remember, you 
are still human and there is always someone smarter. I've seen that 
"technically uninformed" line used by to many people who didn't want to 
change their viewpoint.

And you seem to have missed the point here - he was giving you a hint that you 
should at least try to be civil. I have limited capacity for that myself when 
dealing with people that have offended me, but I am trying to keep a civil 
tone in these communications nonetheless.
