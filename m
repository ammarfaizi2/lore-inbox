I think linux's support for so many architectures is important in this 
respect. I can now compare and choose between several distinct architectures, 
rather than just different flavour of x86. That's where the real competition 
will be long-term. (indeed, I would probably buy ia64 if not for the fact 
that I can put together 5 opteron systems for the price of 1 ia64...)

I'm don't usually subscribe to conspiracy theories, but I've got this really 
nasty suspicion that intel really did conspire with microsoft to delay win64 
until their x86-64 chip was ready.

The more influential linux becomes, the easier it will become for amd et al to 
compete, and relegate this sort of bullshit to then past, where it belongs. 
And competition means faster/better/cheaper processors, which is what I care 
about.
