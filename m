Agreed, open hardware design seems to be stuck at the point that good
solutions exist, that are not made accessible like it's done by Linux
distributors in the software world. For Techsource it might be more
worthwhile to play that role than developing a design from scratch.
There's even a project for an open 3D GPU in VHDL:
