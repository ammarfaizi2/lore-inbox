Using the configuration below (UP+PREEMPT, all user-visible ACPI
configuration options disabled), I get the following errors at link
time:

  arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0xc9ab): In function `acpi_apic_setup':
  : undefined reference to `smp_found_config'
  arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0xc9b0): In function `acpi_apic_setup':
  : undefined reference to `clustered_apic_check'

This change "fixes" it, in that the link succeeds and the machine
boots and seems to work.
