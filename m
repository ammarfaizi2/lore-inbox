Actually, what often happens on the LKML is that there a handfull
who are ready to get flamed, and there's a pack in the back that
would rather get some work done and have others take the heat for
ideas they themselves share. So some may discount Andrea and
Christoph, but I have a hunch there are others out there who
think the same but just don't want to waste time feeding flames.

Oh believe me, leading is not a problem here.

Been there done that. This is not about leadership, it's about
equilibrium.
