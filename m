Thanks for your email unfortunately I/My company no longer support or
endorse the use of any OS INCLUDING Linux, this is because of a 
recent spat (IM also known as Hell.Surfers@cwctv.net) please use the 
proprietary drivers available at www.mbsi.ca/cnxtlindrv, I believe
Mr. Hedrick would say. The source code is not safe under the GPL...

Cheers, Dean.
DM. Technologies, UK.

P.S There was a nice V.90 stack for open use I made, anyone want it?
Im now selling the license to use it as a part of a winmodem driver 
for £9,999.99, only binary use in the community, ah revenge is sweet..

Go suck a lemon Richard.
