Well, I am a real newbie to Linux coding, but I think the guy tried to do 
right (irc sent him here) - maybe I am not used to the terseness of Kernel 
hackers in their replies sometimes.


Yitzchak: I have the book - by Robert Love.  I see the same code (page 53), 
but, alas I haven't a clue...

My advice is drop a mail to Robert about it - he _is_ the author, and I am 
sure he will answer your query.
