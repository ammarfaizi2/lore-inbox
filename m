Only if it is a crime by E.U. standards, too. Copying a CD isn't (yet).

The proposed change to the german law is consided unconstitutional
by many lawyers (and if the current governement is really stupid
enough to pass the law, it will almost surely get shot down by the
german supreme court.

I'm pretty sure that Germany will not get pressured into an US-like
DMCA. We will have to obey E.U. law in the end and in the E.U. there
are some countries with more backbone than ours (France, e.g. who
basically spit on anything that comes out of the U.S....).
