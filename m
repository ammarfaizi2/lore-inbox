It seems that you have a very hard time seing why I would be defending
something when I'm not making any $ out of it. RMS isn't making any $
from GPL software. Is he then hiding something?

The problem isn't what I do with it. The problem is Linux's usage in
this application field. Beyond what I do with it, there's Linux's
usage in the embedded field and the freedom that comes with its use.
Linux is simply not being put to use in that field. Our everyday lives
continue to be controlled by devices which no ones knows what runs
in them. Apart from Windows, our entire society is based on software
which we have never seen. Planes, cars, satellites, phones, etc. are
all running some sort of OS which we've never seen (so to speak).
How good is this to any of us?

Well, for one thing, I didn't call you an ignorant. I'm glad you are aware
of the facts. I can't say I support/disapprove of Usenix's decision (since
I wasn't there) and I certainly have no objection in FSMLabs making money
out of their work, as I said previously many times on the rt mailing lists.
But when it comes to using a patent to tie Linux's entire future in one
field of application to one vendor and one vendor only, I have a very strong
objection.

I won't elaborate on this, but I understand why you disagree.
