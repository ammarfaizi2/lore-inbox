What's the current status of Highpoint RAID drivers, for both 2.4 and 2.6?

I was using a 2.4 kernel just fine with my HP474 PCI card. I know some
people had lots of DMA issues with it (I had them as well for some time).
The thing is, inmediately after I plugged a new USB UPS (to be specific, a
MGE Premium 800) I started to see those problems.
