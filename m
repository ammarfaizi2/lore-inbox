Well, after looking at that stupid license and deciding that I didn't
like it (click "disagree"), I decided to see what I could find at the
site that didn't involve going through some contract-acceptance CGI.
"wget -r http://www.viarch.org/" found a few random press releases and
a 295,480 byte application/pdf file html/Spec/document/san_10.pdf.

I don't know what the path is on the site, but you don't have to agree
to anything to just get the spec.
