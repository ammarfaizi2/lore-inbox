Don't know exactly what changed but when I faced this issue Greg KH suggested 
to reproduce on 2.6.11-rc3 and it didn't happen there.

(I am assuming that the issue you are seeing is the same as what I saw since 
the  error message looks similar and even I was using a USB disk when the 
error happened.)
