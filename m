I've compiled kernel 2.2.18 with DHCP support for
diskless workstation. And I noticed, that machine 
doesn't send DHCP requests.

2.2.16 in identical configuration works good.

Is it really bug?

I'm sending my .config in attachment.

Michal 'Orr' Daszkowski

PS. Forgive me my poor english please. :)
