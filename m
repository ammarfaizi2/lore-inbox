And then they join the Polygamist Mormon Church down in Manti, an LDS
spin-off.   The State government only gets involved when the girls are 
under 16, and forced to marry these old men.  Hey, Trevor, long time 
no see.  Haven't seen you around for a while.  How many wives do you 
have, BTW?  I only have one.  I can't imagime trying to deal with more
than one at a time.
