Happens with CONFIG_X86_POWERNOW_K6 disabled, ie. you cannot enable 
CONFIG_X86_POWERNOW_K7 w/o enabling CONFIG_X86_POWERNOW_K7.
Also the indenting in the cpufreq menu seems to be wrong. Shouldn't 
'Intel Speedstep', 'Intel Pentium 4', 'Transmeta LongRun' and 'Cyrix 
MediaGX' be childs of CPU Frequency scaling an indented by 2 spaces?
