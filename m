The problem is that if Linus is simply ignoring you then you don't know
why, A simple "Clean up the ifdefs" would make a lot of difference. If
someone sent a patch its because they hit something they felt needed fixing
and as far as they can tell fixed it. If you want them to go elsewhere
ignore them, but its much more useful to give them at least brief answers
to actual patch files
