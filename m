I'd like Linux kernel to improve.

I do have tons of old stuff (even 386s with pitiful 16mb RAM!!!)
at my present job. Right now it seems impossible to run Linux on them
(you can't run any office suite in linux on such weak box,
however, win95 can (painfully slow but...))
and buying more RAM for them is problematic
(hard to find + how to convince my boss??)
