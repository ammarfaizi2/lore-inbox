Hi,

I'm pleased to report that Linksys has noticed the activity here and is now in 
the process of determining what must be released under the GPL.  I will keep 
this list updated on what I receive.

My current contact within Linksys also noted that the company has a long 
tradition of support for Linux.  Previously, they have shipped CDs containing 
GPL'd source with their networking products.  I'm told the lack of source for 
the WRT54G was not intentional and is an isolated incident.

If anyone has any material that they want me to forward on to the people at 
Linksys, please drop me a line at this address.
