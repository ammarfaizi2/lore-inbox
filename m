I think that's a bit unfair.  Rather, I suspect people see the word 'stable',
and assume, for some unknown reason, that the kernel is stable.  *AHEM*

Seriously, though - even distributions are including 2.4 kernels now.  RedHat,
Mandrake, Slackware ... Should the latest versions of these distributions be
considered unstable as well?

Perhaps it needs to be made clear to people that these kernels still aren't
all they could be.
