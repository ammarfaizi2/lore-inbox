My dual 1.2 Athlon MPs  work great as well.  I have my DMA on without 
any troubles though.  Actually I have never had
a problem with Athlons and Linux.  I have a 650MHz and a 1GHz as well 
and they are rock solid.  I would look at your
check your hardware before blaming the software.  I have compiled kernel 
after kernel, made a couple graphic posters of
the kernel, and run many simulations on it without incident.

I did however have one of those mammoth 460W power supplies fail on me 
though.  As long as you don't use the AGP Pro
slot on the board you should have more then enough power from it.  I 
have 4 hard drives on it, two cdroms working, and
about 8 fans without any problems.
