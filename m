Hi everyone,

   I'm a graduate student strongly interested in linux 
kernel/networking. I just started studying the kernel
a couple of months ago and want to know more, especially about the 
networking part, like TCP/IP, UDP/IP
implementation, how congestion control in TCP is done, how different 
timers work, how the sequence number
are managed, etc. I'm planning to do some research on TCP congestion 
control and network bandwidth measurement.
Can anybody give me a point where to start? Thank you.

SR
