They'd done what DN had promised and never did - merged old usenet
archives into their database, all way back to '81.

The earliest they have on comp.os.linux is March 1992 and results of voting
on newgroup had been posted by tytso on Mar 25 1992.  There's a bogus
crosspost into (still not existing) c.o.l on Mar 21 and regular postings
starting on Mar 31.  IOW, archive goes all way back to the group creation.

alt.os.linux archives there start on Jan 19 1992 (newgrouped somewhere
around Jan 17, took several days to propagate).  Before that it's c.o.minix,
but by the time you are looking for migration from c.o.m should've been
over.
