Cool ... I've been meaning to put together a "student's projects"
page for http://kernelnewbies.org/ for a while now, but haven't
gotten around to it. ;(

But feel free to drop by on #kernelnewbies any time you want, I'm
sure we'll be able to find a few projects to work on.

Btw ... any volunteers to help document a number of student projects
for the Linux kernel so we can put a page up with a bunch of
possible kernel projects ?

regards,

Rik
