Hi all.

I'm about to finish my present employment, and have wondered about the
possibility of getting paid to finish off the 2.4 version of Software
Suspend and do the port to 2.6. How does one go about seeing if anyone
might be interested in funding such a project for a few months?

Regards,

Nigel
