Hello All,

I have a question, sorry if it is totally out of this league.
I have been trying to compile a 2.5 kernel with modules support for a 
while, and have always been unsuccessful.
There are always unresolved symbols.
Always. Tons of em. If I didn't know any better, I'd say all of them of 
which I tried to compile as modules.
I am not a newbie to Linux, I have been putting together distros for 
over 6 years, but the past year or two I have been maintaining stable 
releases in production environments.
Just recently, I have tried to build the 2.5 tree, adn I know I am 
missing something.

I am using Slackware 9.0, which is glibc 2.3.1 and gcc 3.2.2.
Modutils 2.4.25 with Rusty's module-init-tools-0.9.12.
It is mostly Vanilla otherwise.

I know I must be missing a lot of tools and system-side changes to 
accomodate a 2.5 kernel, and I have been trying to identify what they are.

No need to get too specific, I have been categorically a kernel "user" 
for quite some time (just not a 2.5 one), so I just need quick info and 
links.


Thanks in advance!!
