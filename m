Note the "derived work"; there is no way on this earth (or any other) that
you could regard the device's firmware as being a "derived work" of the
driver! AFAICS, the firmware is just a file served up to the device as
needed - no more a derivative work from the kernel than my homepage is a
derivative work of Apache.
