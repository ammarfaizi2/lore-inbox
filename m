Hey,

The patch here needed for cryptoloop volumes with keysize specified and
such (the losetup-combined.patch) located here:
http://www.stwing.org/~sluskyb/util-linux/losetup-combined.patch is
offline at the moment.

Does anyone have a copy?
Why is it not included with util-linux anyway?

I plan on moving to dm-crypt for these types of things but I have some
backup DVDs that use the cryptoloop system still and are unmountable
until I can get my hands on this patch.

Yours,
John.
