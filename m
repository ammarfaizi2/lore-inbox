MacOS X is much better than the earlier ones, if you get rid if the
terrible GUI, that is.  The file manager wouldn't even let me see
/tmp, or a whole lot of other files.  I tried to burn a CD-RW, but
that failed.  The problem was it already had some files on it, so
macos kindly mounted it for me, and then refused to write erase a
mounted disk.  Enough of this ranting, though.  It's off-topic.
