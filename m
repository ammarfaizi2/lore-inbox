Hi,

Is there any publication somewhere which summarizes the planned changes
during the 2.5.x cycle? It would be nice to know exactly WHAT type of
new changes will be done and who works on them.

Or just to know answers like when will be alsa,XFS,dirindex for ext2/ext3
and such new features will be integrated and what is the current state
of these projects and so on ...
