the first check of all - really unmuted?
the alsa mixer has "mute" state, which is shown as 'M' at the top of
the volume bar on alsamixer.  you can toggle it via key 'M'.

if it's not the case, try to unmute and raise "Headphone" volume.
some devices use True LINEOUT as the wave lineout.
if this solves the problem, please let me know the output of
"lspci -vv" and "lspci -nv" (for the sound deice only).
