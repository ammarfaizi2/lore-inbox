David,

Your assumption is based solely on the "COLLECTIVE" issue.

Where as the application of "COMBINED" or "CONCATINATION" is not addressed
or suggested.  Suggested or implied do not cut the legal points.

The issue of "distribution" has no clear definition.

Same media?
Same box?
Same ftp site?
Same crate?
Same delivery truck?
Same warehouse?

Simple presence does not make it "distribution", in part or whole.

If you were just quoting, I would not have an issue.
I have issue of your applied meanings, which are direct result of IMHO.
The fastest way to shut me up, other than DM killfiling me to the list, is
to present a legal opinion/brief from an attorney who will back the
position.

Cheers,
