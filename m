Could there be issued a general license for export of the Linux kernel from the
U.S. ?

It seems that even though the politics/politicians may not be entirely up to
par with reality, that there is also some understanding of the need to share
and cooperate in development of a secure operating system kernel.  Most
notably, the NSA Secure Linux Project.  While this doesn't include crypto, it
includes a number of other technologies which are (like crypto) necessary for a
secure environment, but (like crypto) not any magic secret technology that it
would make sense to restrict exports on.

Could someone from "inside" give an oppinion on this ?

As far as I know, it should be possible to get a general license for the export
of the Linux kernel (by some definition thereof).  It works like this in my
country too, and probably many others.

If this could be done with the U.S. perhaps other countries with export/import
controls would be more willing to negotiatiate similar deals.  "First we take
Manhattan, then we take Berlin"  ;)
