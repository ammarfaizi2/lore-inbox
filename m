Wasn't there a South Park episode making fun of the dot coms where they
were starting a business and someone asked about the plan and they said

	Step 1: Idea
	Step 2: Err...
	Step 3: Make money

Or something like that.  Where ever it was, it was pretty funny, it was 
quite obvious that the vast majority of the failures could be traced
to a lack of a step 2.  Seems so simple, doesn't it?
