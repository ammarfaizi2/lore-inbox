   Looks like all  @wanadoo.fr  addresses have been kicked out.

   That ISP has a habit of returning 500-series reponse codes
   with supplementary text of style:
	"System is too busy, please come back latter"

   Which of course generates error bounce (like all 500 series
   codes are supposed to by the RFC 821)  leading to removal
   of erroring address from the list.

   Had we fully automated the removal process, both  WANADOO.FR
   and GMX.NET/GMX.DE/GMX.AT users would get kicked out every day
   around 18-24 CET (UTC+1h).   Now it is matter of manual oversight,
   and while I have been lenient letting those users be, listowners
   have different minds.
