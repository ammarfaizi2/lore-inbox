This patch updates UML to 2.5.47.

Functionally, this is the same UML as the last working patch I had, which
was for 2.5.44, which was up to UML 2.4.19-12.  Since I'm now up to 2.4.19-31,
I have a bunch of merging to do, and those patches will be forthcoming.

The patch is available at
	http://uml-pub.ists.dartmouth.edu/uml/uml-patch-2.5.47-1.bz2
