Hi folks.

Today I saw well-known "innd bug"(truncate(tm)), and my brother said
he had seen it with -test12-pre7. I don't know about -test12-pre3,
neither I nor my brother hadn't noticed it since -test10. But we could
miss it with -test12-pre3, and I didn't try any -test11 kernels. Thus
possibly that was introduced changes between -test12-pre3 and
-test12-pre7, but I can definitly say it present in -test12-final.

Another truncate(tm)?
