Oh, please. This was not my intention. I was just suggesting something 
like this could be done in the real world, also don't I have these ideas. 
I just think it might save you some time when you've accidently rm'd your 
.config, and all you want to have is a .config for the local box. Also 
wouldn't I load all the modules one by one, possibly.

If you think it's a _deadly_bad_idea_to_do_ please tell me. It is, after 
all, just an RFC, means I request you to comment on this. I could even ask 
for kernel protection for the mice.
