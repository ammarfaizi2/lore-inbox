I totally and utterly agree with you.  They have every right to ignore 
the petition, but those we signed it were acting out their right of 
freedom of speech.  I know all the people who signed it, and none of 
them likely would force ANYTHING on anyone.  Rather then looking at this 
as an ultimatum, look at it as a request.  Negative responses only lead 
to more negatives responses back, and nothing EVER comes out of flame 
wars, ever.  Except worthless air being wasted by the likes of some.

cheers,
