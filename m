Now if somebody here could just point me to a decent reference on A/UX - 
Apple's mid-80's version of Unix (for the early macintosh, I believe...)

A big thing I'm trying to show in my book is that Unix has been, for almost 
thirty years, the standard against which everything else was compared.  Even 
when it wasn't what people were directly using it's what the techies were 
thinking about when they designed their other stuff.  (That and the Xerox 
Parc work...)

Let's see, the real earthquakes in the computing world (off the top of my 
head) are:

MIT: project whirlwind (which got computing off of vacuum tubes, spawned DEC, 
and Minsky's hacker lab.  Gurus too numerous to mention.)

Bell Labs: (the transistor, and 20 years later Unix.  Gurus ken thompson, 
dennis ritchie, the three transistor guys, ).

DARPA: (Arpanet (BBN), funded project MAC at MIT, and Multics which brought 
the MIT stuff to bell labs.)

Xerox Parc (WIMP interface, WYSIWYG word processing/printing/desktop 
publishing, object oriented programming, 

The integrated circuit/microchip (Texas Instruments' manufacturing 
innovation, which led to the Intel 4004, which eventually led to the Altair, 
which led to the personal computer.  Moore's Law would probably be the theme 
here...)

The whole free software thing (Berkeley in the 70's to early 80's, Stallman 
and the FSF taking over from there.  And Andrew Tanenbaum's Minix, which 
spawned Linux...)

Huh, I'd have to mention IBM (forget the PC, how about the winchester 
drive?), and of course the AT&T breakup (a negative earthquake, but big 
anyway, sort of leading to the commercialization of the software side of 
things, although Gates was trying that already.  AT&T just removed a lot of 
the roadblocks by shattering the opposition for a while.)

Alright, I need to sit down and make an outline and a timeline.   I admit 
this...  (Collecting the data is the easy part.  ORGANIZING this fermenting 
heap of disconnected facts and observations is the hard part...)
