Maybe. But what prevents them to releasing the driver if binaries
are not allowed?

"Binary drivers will make all devices just work" is a dream. Maybe a nice
one, but just a dream. It seldom works this way in Windows (almost every
time you run into some minor, but annoying bug noone is willing to fix),
why should it work with Linux?
