 frankly speaking, the advertising on cars, monitors and other stuff
only changed, because it is illegal to do otherwise (you can use the old
units, but not alone and not prominently). IMHO in most peoples minds
the old units are still prevalent.

 When looking at the new new notation for binary units, I just think the
standards organisations made a huge maistake :-( But standard is
standard. Better take it now.
