Well, it *is* cheap.

But whenever I hear from anybody who regularly does nontrivial stuff in  
that area and knows more software than just The Gimp, what they have to  
say about The Gimp isn't particularly flattering.

It seems The Gimp isn't quite at the same level in its area as, say, the  
Linux kernel is in its.
