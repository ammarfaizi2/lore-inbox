-	bool "Network device support"
-	---help---
-	  You can say N here if you don't intend to connect your Linux box to
-	  any other computer at all or if all your connections will be over a
-	  telephone line with a modem either via UUCP (UUCP is a protocol to
-	  forward mail and news between unix hosts over telephone lines; read
-	  the UUCP-HOWTO, available from
-	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>) or dialing up a shell

-	  almost full Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up
-	  shell account on some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
-	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>).
-
-	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains a network card that
-	  you want to use under Linux (make sure you know its name because you
-	  will be asked for it and read the Ethernet-HOWTO (especially if you
-	  plan to use more than one network card under Linux)) or if you want
-	  to use SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol is the protocol used to
-	  send Internet traffic over telephone lines or null modem cables) or
-	  CSLIP (compressed SLIP) or PPP (Point to Point Protocol, a better
-	  and newer replacement for SLIP) or PLIP (Parallel Line Internet
-	  Protocol is mainly used to create a mini network by connecting the
-	  parallel ports of two local machines) or AX.25/KISS (protocol for
-	  sending Internet traffic over amateur radio links).
-
-	  Make sure to read the NET-3-HOWTO. Eventually, you will have to read
-	  Olaf Kirch's excellent and free book "Network Administrator's
-	  Guide", to be found in <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#guide>. If

-config DUMMY
-	tristate "Dummy net driver support"
-	depends on NETDEVICES
-	---help---
-	  This is essentially a bit-bucket device (i.e. traffic you send to
-	  this device is consigned into oblivion) with a configurable IP
-	  address. It is most commonly used in order to make your currently
-	  inactive SLIP address seem like a real address for local programs.
-	  If you use SLIP or PPP, you might want to say Y here. Since this
-	  thing often comes in handy, the default is Y. It won't enlarge your
-	  kernel either. What a deal. Read about it in the Network
-	  Administrator's Guide, available from
-	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#guide>.
-
-	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
-	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
-	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
-	  will be called dummy.o.  If you want to use more than one dummy
-	  device at a time, you need to compile this driver as a module.
-	  Instead of 'dummy', the devices will then be called 'dummy0',
-	  'dummy1' etc.
-
-config SLIP
-	tristate "SLIP (serial line) support"
-	depends on NETDEVICES
-	---help---
-	  Say Y if you intend to use SLIP or CSLIP (compressed SLIP) to
-	  connect to your Internet service provider or to connect to some
-	  other local Unix box or if you want to configure your Linux box as a
-	  Slip/CSlip server for other people to dial in. SLIP (Serial Line
-	  Internet Protocol) is a protocol used to send Internet traffic over
-	  serial connections such as telephone lines or null modem cables;
-	  nowadays, the protocol PPP is more commonly used for this same
-	  purpose.
-
-	  Normally, your access provider has to support SLIP in order for you
-	  to be able to use it, but there is now a SLIP emulator called SLiRP
-	  around (available from
-	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
-	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection. If
-	  you plan to use SLiRP, make sure to say Y to CSLIP, below. The
-	  NET-3-HOWTO, available from
-	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to
-	  configure SLIP. Note that you don't need this option if you just
-	  want to run term (term is a program which gives you almost full
-	  Internet connectivity if you have a regular dial up shell account on
-	  some Internet connected Unix computer. Read
-	  <http://www.bart.nl/~patrickr/term-howto/Term-HOWTO.html>). SLIP
-	  support will enlarge your kernel by about 4 KB. If unsure, say N.
-
-	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
-	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
-	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as
-	  <file:Documentation/networking/net-modules.txt>. The module will be
-	  called slip.o.
-
-config SLIP_COMPRESSED
-	bool "CSLIP compressed headers"
-	depends on SLIP
-	---help---
-	  This protocol is faster than SLIP because it uses compression on the
-	  TCP/IP headers (not on the data itself), but it has to be supported
-	  on both ends. Ask your access provider if you are not sure and
-	  answer Y, just in case. You will still be able to use plain SLIP. If
-	  you plan to use SLiRP, the SLIP emulator (available from
-	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/>) which
-	  allows you to use SLIP over a regular dial up shell connection, you
-	  definitely want to say Y here. The NET-3-HOWTO, available from
-	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>, explains how to configure
-	  CSLIP. This won't enlarge your kernel.
-
-config SLIP_SMART
-	bool "Keepalive and linefill"
-	depends on SLIP
-	help
-	  Adds additional capabilities to the SLIP driver to support the
-	  RELCOM line fill and keepalive monitoring. Ideal on poor quality
-	  analogue lines.
-
-config SLIP_MODE_SLIP6
-	bool "Six bit SLIP encapsulation"
-	depends on SLIP
-	help
-	  Just occasionally you may need to run IP over hostile serial
-	  networks that don't pass all control characters or are only seven
-	  bit. Saying Y here adds an extra mode you can use with SLIP:
-	  "slip6". In this mode, SLIP will only send normal ASCII symbols over
-	  the serial device. Naturally, this has to be supported at the other
-	  end of the link as well. It's good enough, for example, to run IP
-	  over the async ports of a Camtec JNT Pad. If unsure, say N.
-
-config PPP
-	tristate "PPP (point-to-point protocol) support"
-	depends on NETDEVICES
-	---help---
-	  PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a newer and better SLIP.  It serves
-	  the same purpose: sending Internet traffic over telephone (and other
-	  serial) lines.  Ask your access provider if they support it, because
-	  otherwise you can't use it; most Internet access providers these
-	  days support PPP rather than SLIP.
-
-	  To use PPP, you need an additional program called pppd as described
-	  in the PPP-HOWTO, available at
-	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.  Make sure that you have
-	  the version of pppd recommended in <file:Documentation/Changes>.
-	  The PPP option enlarges your kernel by about 16 KB.
-
-	  There are actually two versions of PPP: the traditional PPP for
-	  asynchronous lines, such as regular analog phone lines, and
-	  synchronous PPP which can be used over digital ISDN lines for
-	  example.  If you want to use PPP over phone lines or other
-	  asynchronous serial lines, you need to say Y (or M) here and also to
-	  the next option, "PPP support for async serial ports".  For PPP over
-	  synchronous lines, you should say Y (or M) here and to "Support
-	  synchronous PPP", below.
-
-	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
-	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
-	  If you said Y to "Version information on all symbols" above, then
-	  you cannot compile the PPP driver into the kernel; you can then only
-	  compile it as a module.  The module will be called ppp_generic.o.
-	  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
-	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt> as well as

-	  lines) or PPP (a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave like

-	---help---
-	  PLIP (Parallel Line Internet Protocol) is used to create a

-	  local machines.  A PLIP link from a Linux box is a popular means to
-	  install a Linux distribution on a machine which doesn't have a
-	  CD-ROM drive (a minimal system has to be transferred with floppies
-	  first). The kernels on both machines need to have this PLIP option
-	  enabled for this to work.
-
-	  The PLIP driver has two modes, mode 0 and mode 1.  The parallel
-	  ports (the connectors at the computers with 25 holes) are connected
-	  with "null printer" or "Turbo Laplink" cables which can transmit 4
-	  bits at a time (mode 0) or with special PLIP cables, to be used on
-	  bidirectional parallel ports only, which can transmit 8 bits at a
-	  time (mode 1); you can find the wiring of these cables in
-	  <file:Documentation/networking/PLIP.txt>.  The cables can be up to
-	  15m long.  Mode 0 works also if one of the machines runs DOS/Windows
-	  and has some PLIP software installed, e.g. the Crynwr PLIP packet
-	  driver (<http://oak.oakland.edu/simtel.net/msdos/pktdrvr-pre.html>)
-	  and winsock or NCSA's telnet.
