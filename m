OK, I answered to fast, not reading the mails correct and without
concentration
Surely, millibytes does not make any sense...

A long time ago the MB was under computer scientiests defined as 1024 KB ans
we had used it it one or two decades. Then the hardware manufactures started
to call 1 MB = 1000 MB and that's shit.

I know this problem, I also know the problem, that is gonna be confusing.
I do not insist to change it but I think it is better to make clear what is
defined as 1000 or 1024 insted using MB for both.

Have I said that?

Then I apopolgize. Otherwise I read the mail I replied not as careful as I
should and I talked at this moment whitch someone so I was not as
concentraded as I had to...
