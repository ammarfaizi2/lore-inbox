Not much statistics, but I'm using supermount since september 1997 on half
a dozen boxes I manage without any problem. To me, the very fact that it
didn't get ported to 2.1 represents a showstopper for 2.2 (will never
downgrade to a linux without supermount available, be it a patch or
-better- integrated within the kernel)

I cheered some more times Stephen for this piece of code, but doing it
once more shouldn't harm: "An Hurray for Stephen, who gave us supermount"
