News flash: it's a well documented fact that there was nobody at Sun who
before or since has spent as much time as I have trying to free up Sun's
code.  

Take a look at http://www.bitmover.com/lm/papers/srcos.html which Bob Young
credits as having a large influence on how Red Hat was set up, also well
documented.

Tell me again that I don't understand free software and that I'm against it
and all you do is make yourself look even more foolish.  Whether you want 
to resemble one of the wackos on soapbox in Hyde Park is up to you, but
that's what you look like.
