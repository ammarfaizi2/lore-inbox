That a problem? Anyway, when you need to compile something
in order to make a change (or append to something as strange
as an initrd, for that matter), I do not consider this themeing.

Humans like to be in control of things. If something's too fast
for them, or they do not understand it (or even worse: both),
they try to keep away from it. This, I believe, is only superceded
by curiousity. (Which would explain initial interest in things
such as Linux).

Seems like here, the need for control is even stronger: When
you understand something, and know it is a mighty tool, you
also wish to control it. On the other hand, you want your
mighty tool to always keep you posted on what it's up to.
(See "The Seven Habits of Seedy Assistants (tm)" for reference).

What do you mean? Gets my attention...

Yup. Not to forget that we like eyecandy.

Maybe. Know how ill-reputed the Windows Bluescreen is? Let's
discuss this a bit...
