Ok, I previously read about it in README.copy but I did misunderstud it, thanks for
your clarification

I never had problems burning successfully in TAO mode with kernel > 2.5.5X. Please note, 
I still have not used the writer in dao/raw96* mode (or don't remember). I included the 
config after the signature, It's a simple sis735 IDE system.

I have stabily problems in the system but I belive it's a graphic card problem
(or heat that causes it)

I will report more about it when I make some copy
