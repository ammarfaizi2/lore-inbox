Since the last shootout was so popular, I was able to get my hands on
some better hardware to run even more tests. As well the generated
results format was improved slightly. 

Bonnie++ and IOZone results on an AMD Opteron 240 system, comparing
2.6.0test5,test7,test8 as well as SCSI vs. IDE are now posted
for your viewing pleasure at: http://fsbench.netnation.com/
