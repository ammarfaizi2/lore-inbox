Yes, osimplay is probably for 4 people on the planet. The 4 that don't
confuse writing an operating system with porting Minix to pmode. All 4 of
whom have been ostracized from the Linux Kernel Clique, but who probably
still read l-k occaisionally to see what kind of shenanigans Billy's Free
Unix Boys are up to, like pretending SMP scales.

By the way, if you don't like the looks of a "bastard offspring of a
drunken encounter between Intercal and APL" (Smoorenberg), it's a shell
script, moron, so if you're more comfortable, it shouldn't even take a
Kernel-cliquer more than a few minutes to make it resemble a cross between
Alan Cox, Matthew Wilcox, a plate of bad sushi and a couple hundred
ioctls. With more teeth than Torvalds. Just don't leave it where I might
get a whiff of it.
