Hi Buddy,

O'Reilly has two books of potential interest:

Understanding the Linux Kernel
              Daniel P. Bovet, Marco Cesati
              O'Reilly & Associates, PAP edition, Published November 2000, 
   	      684 pages, u_inx_kernel, ISBN 0596000022
Linux Device Drivers, 2nd Edition
              Alessandro Rubini, Jonathan Corbet
              O'Reilly & Associates, 2nd edition, Published June 2001, 
	      564 pages, ln_dv_dr_n_aa, ISBN 0596000081

Both are recently updated and contain at least 2.4pre information in
addition to 2.2 (and some 2.0).

Bookpool.com has always treated me very well and currently has a 43%
sale on O'Reilly titles.

HTH,
Daniel
