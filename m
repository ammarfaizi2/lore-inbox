You seem to be forgetting one important detail.

The internet is not public property, it is a large group of
interconnected private properties.

The owners of each of these private properties can decide
for themselves what content they do and do not want to have
on their own properties.

So-called "freedom of speech" is something that exists in
public space, I can organise protests in public space and
you can't do anything about it, but if I were to held a
protest in your garden you'd have every right to kick me
out. ;)

Rik
