So to truly understand your statements, it is a possible position of
RedHat to use and promote OSL over GPL?  If this is the case, where you
have an creedence in previous statements about GPL?  What it comes down to
is make the changes in module.h to make OSL products an code functional
with GPL and to hell with FSF.

There ablitity to freely impose restriction of compatablity is a
restriction in itself.  Thus can have the effect if invalidating all the
licenses issued to date as it relates to the kernel.  In effect making the
RTU/TOS non existant.

This does seem to raise the concern and a call for possible action to
adopt the superior license which protects and promotes the ideas if the
OSC and not the sole interest of FSF.

Thanks for the easy win point in the debate.

Clearly OSL has been deemed by RH as the license preferred to promote,
"achieves desired goals for free software" clause below.

The migration is simple, all it takes is enough key people to convert
their license for RTU to OSL and have a determine ruling from
OpenSource.org that GPL is compatible to operate in an OSL environment but
does not receive the benefits of OSL legal status and protection to the
author.
