Arjan, I would dearly love to get useful feedback on why things like my 
Configure.help patches weren't applied.  It would be a delight like 
water in the desert to *hear* some reasons!

But I think you know very well that the usual flow looks like this:

1. You throw a patch over the wall to Linus.

2. Either it shows up in the next release...

3. ...or you hear a vast and echoing silence.
