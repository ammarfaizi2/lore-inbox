  The mantra of doomed IPOs ill-fated software projects, and the guy down
the street who has never invested in a company which was still in business
24 months later. No matter how great the concept it still has to work. 

  It's conceptionally obvious that professional programmers working for a
major software house will write a better os than a grad student fighting
off boredom one summer... in the end you always need data.
