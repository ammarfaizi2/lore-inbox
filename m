No this isn´t a driver rewrite for the kernel I need help on rewriting some 
code that I have to be only working with 2.4x kernel´s do you think you 
could help. I would appericate it.

INFO:
I´m working on a Modem driver that run´s with kernel 2.4x I have got the 
code running on a 2.2x system with no trouble. The driver is for a Ac´97 
Modem (WINMODEM). The driver can find the modem and print out output but I 
can´t seem to include DevFs, I would also like to implement Interrupt 
Handling.
Here is the driver location:
