Hi Marcel, Hi All,

Please a colleague is trying to setup RH Linux 7.2 on a very old 486
(100Mhz)  RAM = 53MB. HDD = 4GB
It startsup, when it tries to load:"loading initrd.img............" It comes
up with an error;

Kernel Panic: Attemted to kill the idle task - not syncing
Linux noapic will not work

I suggested turning off/on any ACPI stuff's in the BIOS?
I have searched on the web but most references are to stuffs changed in
kernel version 2.4.x etc

It seems APIC has something to do with ACPI or IRQ management/allocation?
Is there anything to be done to get the RH 7.2 to install on this box or
there is no hope at all?

I am sorry for the disjointed "flow" of this mail, it's because I am running
against time - it's
10:40PM here! The Internet link is a little flaky too, but I will see wat I
can find (again)
on the Web tomorrow.

Hope to hear from you soon. Thanks.
