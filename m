Don't think I am not looking for other cards.
Of course nobody will hear from me: buy an nvidia card.
But if it is a mem problem I will use badmem.
No money for new mem or a new graphics card at the moment :(

Even if that is a little bit OT. What card is good (performance for games and 
a acceptable licenze for kernel developers)? I saw that Matrox has nice 
drivers which are not open source but at least you can see the source.

I need a card with good OpenGL performance and things like that ( I want doom3 
if it is out). I don't know much about Radeon.


thanks
have fun
Felix
