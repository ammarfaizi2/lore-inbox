Geez.  Excuse me.  I should watch my assumptions.

Out of curiosity, is there a reason why lspci reports vt82c586 and the
kernel reports vt82c686a at bootup?  The board is documented to have the
vt82c686a.  Also, I can't seem to find which VPx is generally associated
with which southbridge.

Regards,
Adrian
