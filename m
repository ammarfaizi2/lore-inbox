Well, if the Module.symvers file does not exist than the script will
fail; unless the script invokes the 'make modules'. 

Incorporating it into the Makefile can ease its use,
because we can transparently trigger rules that can make the
Module.symvers file.

I guess its a question of which way makes it easy to use? and my 
thoughts are leaning towards incorporating it into the Makefile.

I can make it either way. You suggest.
