Hi everyone!

I tried to send this message to the khttpd group, but got no answer. Can
any of you help me?

hi

Does anyone know any details about how Tux performs in comparison with
khttpd?
Is this a separate project, or is it a somehow 'better version' of the
khttpd?
Are these going to be merged?
