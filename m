A good reference is in Debian Policy Section 9.9, where it is stated:

A program must not depend on environment variables to get reasonable
defaults. (That's because these environment variables would have to be
set in a system-wide configuration file like /etc/profile, which is
not supported by all shells.)

Although this is not applicable to the kernel, goggling about this
section of the Debian Policy will give you some arguments against
environment variables in general.
