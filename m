Well I think the first problem is that the idea is currently too big. If
someone were to do this sucessfully they would make the first open cards
something like a Trident 8900C. Something small but usable for people
who need it. The next cards would add onto it, and so on and so on until
you got a base that would meet the 3D ATI/Nvidia needs. Trying to aim
for the top at the beginning is a great way to crater.
