The cool thing is, since the linuxconsole drop-in wasn't going anywhere, I
can move on to more useful pursuits instead of going back and forth with yo=
u.
If you want to spend your time denegrating other SCMs and people that don't
subscribe to your divine development tenets, more power to you.  I've
learned enough from this thread to not waste time arguing with you.  Next
time someone says something about Bitkeeper that I happen to agree or
disagree with, do you suppose I should just e-mail them privately?  Or
should I post here to make sure it gets under your scrutinizing eye?

Apologies to those who read this God awful thread without hitting Control-D
first :P.

M. R.
