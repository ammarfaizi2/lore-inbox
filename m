Is anyone else having trouble rebooting/halting their SMP box using the
ac kernel series since 2.4.6-ac2?  I use a Tyan Tiger 230 and have been
having that particular problem ans 2.4.6-ac2 was the last kernel that
could successfully reboot/halt (all others since then hang at "INIT: No
More Processes At This Run Level").  Also, is anyone out there using an
Asus CUV4X-DLS, and if so does it work reliably, including the on-board
audio, ethernet and SCSI?  Thanks for any information.
