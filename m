I think you would have a hard time convincing a judge that "permit
royalty-free redistribution by all those who receive copies directly
or indirectly through you" applies only to "right now", and you can
reserve the right to start charging royalties or other enforcements at
a later date.

It doesn't say "right now" or "temporarily". It also talks about
people who receive it indirectly through you, and doesn't qualify that
with "as long as they check back with you that you still think its
OK".

If a company decided down the track to 'monetise' one of their
patents, and begun by stopping distribution of the GPLv2 program, then
I suspect that the copyright holders of that program could take action
against them for having been in breach of the license for the period
of distribution. What the penalty for that might be is hard to tell
(it might depend on the jurisdiction and whether the copyright is
registered with the LOC in places like the US). I could certainly
imagine circumstances where the penalty is quite substantial.

Cheers, Tridge
