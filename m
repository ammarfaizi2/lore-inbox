Hello,

I want to solicit your attention in receiving funds on my 
behalf.

The purpose of my contacting you is because you live in a 
country with a stable economy where one can invest.

On receipt of your 
response, I will send you full details and more information 
about 
myself and the funds.

Thank you.

Yun
