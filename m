Now, as near as I can tell, he didn't make them available to you and put
up protections against your acquring information you should not have. It
does not matter if they're pissweak as rot13 or not...

As such any getting around them (either by lieing in answer to a
question of 'Are you an American?' or whatever) would be circumvention
of his digital protection mechanisms and as such your actions would be
punishable under the DMCA, would they not?

This means you can go to gaol without the $200...
