When your random 10 second email post recently gives a more direct
pointer to the information I need or find interesting, then you know
your web site has serious problems. None of those papers are on a
top level link that can be easily accessed. The papers you folks do
are the best documentation outlining your work yet they are the most
difficult to find. That's a serious mistake.

Your sporatic posting on lkml are more informative than the web site.
