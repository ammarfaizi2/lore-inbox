Hi,
  I've twice now experienced more or less solid lockups of 2.4.20, once
with vanilla, the second time with Andrew Morton's ext3 patches from:

	http://www.zip.com.au/%7Eakpm/linux/patches/2.4/2.4.20/

Both times the machine had the HD activity light stuck on, lots of
processes waiting in D state, magic-sysrq key stuff to sync or umount
disks failed miserably and I ended up having to sysrq-b it to reboot
(thank god for ext3 journalling or the fsck would have taken ages).

  This second time with the patches applied it was booted up around Dec
20 22:34:46 (GMT), and locked up around Dec 26 13:14:37 (last entry in
kern.log before the fresh bootup).

  Previously the machine has run for months without a problem on
2.4.18-pre8, a kernel I'd have been off ages ago if 2.4.19 hadn't ALSO
locked up on me once.

  The machine is based around a Gigabyte GA-686BX motherboard, using the
Intel 440BX/ZX chipset:

00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX Host bridge (rev
03)
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 440BX/ZX - 82443BX/ZX AGP bridge (rev
03) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01) (prog-if
80 [Master])
00:07.3 Bridge: Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 02)

IDE devices in it are 4 hard disks:

/dev/hda: Model=3DST32122A, FwRev=3D3.02, SerialNo=3DXKF67385
/dev/hdb: Model=3DMaxtor 82560 A4 -, FwRev=3DAA8Z2225, SerialNo=3DC40AHFXA
/dev/hdc: Model=3DMaxtor 94098U8, FwRev=3DFA500S60, SerialNo=3DG80EK51C
/dev/hdd: Model=3DMaxtor 4G120J6, FwRev=3DGAK819K0, SerialNo=3DG60E058E

There's no X running on it, the machine being a router/file server (NFS
and Samba served outwards).  I'm going to give the latest 2.4.21pre a
try now.

Kernel config (for 2.4.20) is:
