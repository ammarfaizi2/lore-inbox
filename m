That's what I thought too, but bitkeeper has convinced
me to get over that prejudice ;)

That's a tradeoff everybody has to make for himself.
Personally the time bitkeeper saves me helps improving
Linux a lot, so using bitkeeper does help increase my
contribution to the body of public software.

Of course, this is everybody's personal choice and
you're just as right (or wrong) as I am ;)
