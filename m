    If you want, I can prepare a patch for the 2.4 series, but if I
have had problems for a three-line diff to be included, think about
yours... If you think that Marcello will be inclined to accept this
patch I'll prepare it in your name.

    I suppose. But I think it won't do any harm :?? so it should be
accepted. The only think it does is to eliminate some bloat from the
kernel...
