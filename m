yes it's only a heuristic. But at this point in time your stuff has a
smell to it, especially due to your reluctance to resolve/debunk the
issue. So while you're right it's not always clear cut... in this case I
think it pretty much is until you decide to clear things up. As far as
I'm concerned the ball is in your court; you obviously have the power
and opportunity to quickly resolve this and show there's no fish behind
door number 2. Continuing to hide isn't helping to convince us that
there is no dead sea creature.
