Hi everybody,

I want to do "linux kernel code coverage" for 2.4.6 kernel.GCOV is such a
kernel code coverage tool, which i downloaded from net. The downloaded GCOV
is for linux kernel 2.4.17

Is GCOV exists for linux kernel 2.4.6 ?
If so please send me the link for downloading.

If you know other kernel code coverage tools also, please let me know.

Thanks in advance,
Vinolin.
