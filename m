I posted this on comp.os.linux.advocacy some time ago :

"SuSE 9.1 : i'm not impressed, its a drama"
http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=pan.2004.07.03.05.05.30.79714@stokkie.net

There's a small typo inside and that is that :

"Not only did the suse9.1 kernel 2.4.5 ..

should read

"Not only did the suse9.1 kernel 2.6.5 ..
