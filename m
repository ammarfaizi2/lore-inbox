My windows 2000 machine seems to bluescreen inside the intel graphics
drivers now and then. It's slightly more stable than having two cards of the
manufacturer Creative in the same machine at the same time, though.

One day I should put Linux on that machine to see if it crashes as often,
I seem to recall there are open drivers for intel (except for init?). Would be
interesting to compare average use.
