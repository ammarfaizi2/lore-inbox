Oh, I understand attention to detail.  After spending eight years in the United States Navy as a Hospital Corpsman, you either understand attention to detail, or you are not a Corpsman any longer.  :-)  It just struck me as funny that, while an understanding of attention to detail is important, so is the way in which information is communicated.  In fact, it's almost as important as the information itself.  I've seen more fights start over how something was said, or not said - I'm sure you get the picture.  :-)

Me, I mainly lurk here for that very reason - I've received too much hatemail from posting to the list, so I try to follow it instead and see what I can learn.  Today, I learned that multiples of 1024 is actually Ki.  Thank you!  I did not know that.

| 
| It's called attention to detail, and it's the _reason_ why a lot of people
| are here.
| 
| The correct prefix to signify a multiple of 1024 is 'Ki'.
