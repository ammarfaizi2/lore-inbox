Problem: 2.4.10-ac10, -ac11 SMP kernel can't boot on
a SMP Pentium II 450MHz box. The boot process
stops at 

Booting CPU#0
Console: 80x25

Normally I would expect "Calibrating delay loop..." but no go.

Last -ac kernel tried was 2.4.9-ac10 with success.
2.4.10 stock also works.

Has anything affected the CPU startup code?

BTW this is an old dual CPU BX board.
.config file attached.
