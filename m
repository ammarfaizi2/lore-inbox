Please, this is not religion.  No god has spoken "though shalt not...".

In 99% of all cases, what Randy wrote is the best choice.  But the
ultimate goal is not to follow his heavenly rules with fundamental
zealotry, the ultimate goal is to make the code readable.  If you
happen to stumble on the 1% case where the code can be more readable by
not following the rules, and you are absolutely sure about that, then
don't.  That simple. ;)

That said, people who are bereft of all common sense have my blessing to
follow the rules literally in their own code.  Just don't stomp over
mine with pitchforks and torches, ok?
