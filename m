Felix, while I respect you for your work on dietlibc, calling anything that
is not written in hardcore C 'revolting' is missing the point.

And the world yawns. We do not care for (your) religious beliefs, we care
*for facts*. Religion has no place in technology. 

If you have an opinion, voice it without referring to how a program makes
*you* feel. Voice it by stating how it should make everybody feel, based on
technical arguments.

So I could say that I find your attitude disgusting, and I do, but that's
not helping anybody. So instead I'll state that your arguments are
counterproductive because they are only valid in the belief system of Felix
von Leitner, and make no sense to others with differing belief systems.

Regards,

bert
