Hi

    I want to know about the the call
"create_proc_entry". What exactly it does.
Once created how does user make use of it. What are
the interfaces to it for user to communicate with it.
Any documents related to above things will be
helpful.

    Kindly mail to me, I did't subscribe to this
group.

   Thank You.
   Raj.
