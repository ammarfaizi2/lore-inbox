There is no right to speak using particular host.  Dave _is_ admin of
vger and he is not, AFAIK, bound by any contract regarding l-k.  If you
are unhappy with that - create and maintain a list of your own with
whatever policies you happen to like; if somebody else will want to
use it - more power to you.
