Acked ;)  I already took Rene's latest patches to ALSA tree.

I know the current behavior is somewhat out of standard, but would
like to keep it _right now_ for compatibility and usability reasons.

OTOH, it would make sense to keep the driver struct if the ALSA module
parameters are writable after loading.  Then the user have another
chance to retry the probe with different parameters.  Anyway, it's not
for 2.6.17.
