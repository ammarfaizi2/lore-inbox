Hi,
I'm Jason, I'm 14, and all I wanna do is work on the
Linux kernel (Linus is my hero :). I'm a newbie, so I
was looking to start off with something easy. Should I
write a set of functions to make it easier to draw in
the framebuffer? If that's not the sort of thing
you're looking for, what should I do?

Thanks for your help,
Jason
