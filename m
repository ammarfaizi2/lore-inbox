Yes, I think fixing X would ultimately be time better spent.

I do not think that creating device-specific "drivers" is a good idea
even short term, especially in kernel. If you want a "persistent"
device just create a userspace daemon and listen for hotplug events.
When you see the input device you interested in grab it and pipe all
data into somewhere. Next time you see hotplug event for the same
device release the old instance and grab the new one. In cases when
final recepient of events uses ioctls to query input devices capabilities
you can create uinput feed back into kernel. This way your program will
work for all types of input devices and no kernel changes are needed.
