Hello All,

I presume that this has been asked here numerous times before, but I'm on a 
rather limited internet connection (besides mail, that is) and well...

I've been hearing a lot here lately about optimized kernels for Athlons. Is 
this a kernel patch of some sort? And where can I find it - as I have a 
thunderbird system, I would love to try those out and help finding bugs in it!

Thanks

DevilKin
