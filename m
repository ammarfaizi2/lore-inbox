Subject: Will Mosix go into the standard kernel?

Just curious, are there any plans to put Mosix into the standard kernel,
maybe in 2.5, so folks could just configure it and go? it seems that the
number of people with more than one computer might make this a feature many
would at least want to try, especially if it was available as an option by
default. Is there anything in the Mosix folks' implementation that would
prevent this?
