Please try again with 2.5.6-pre2. Unless you can say "it still happens
with the latest 2.5 release (or better: prerelease)" people here will not
pay too much attention to it. For example: ALSA made it into the
mainstream 2.5 kernel in 2.5.5-pre1. This means that any problem related
to ALSA in kernels before 2.5.5-pre1 will be ignored here, unless the
problems are still there.

Developping the linux kernel sure is life in the fast lane...
