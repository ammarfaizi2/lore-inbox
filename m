Hi !

I still have problem with a SGI NFS server and Linux kernel 2.4.6 
concerning a file listing of remote directories.
Actually, I saw a web page that explain the bug is plan to be corrected 
in IRIX 6.5.13 (the page was before this release). I installed it on the 
SGI server, however, the bug always exists !

Is there any solution to get correct file list with this configuration 
(an IRIX patch, a newer version of linux kernel) ?

Friendly
