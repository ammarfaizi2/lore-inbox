It's OK because deflateReset == deflateEnd + deflateInit.  Feel free
to test it though.  You can find my tree at

For the default zlib parameters (which crypto/deflate.c does not use)
the maximum overhead is 5 bytes every 16KB plus 6 bytes.  So for input
streams less than 16KB the figure of 12 bytes is correct.  However,
in general the overhead needs to grow proportionally to the number of
blocks in the input.
