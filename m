If someone sent me a whole slew of hardware and provided a me with a 
steady income so I didn't have to work, I could do this. But fact of the 
matter is, most of the people working on the kernel are doing it not for 
a living, but for fun or they enjoy it. They probably don't have the 
endless fields of hardware that vendors do. If the above is what you 
want, stick with vendor releases and not Linus (or maintainer) releases.
