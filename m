CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Libre Software Meeting 2005
---------------------------------------
Operating system design and implementation

The Libre Software Meeting (LSM) has been one of the most important
Free Software events in France since the year 2000 [0].  This year,
the meeting will take place from July 5th to July 9th in Dijon, to the
East of France.  The Libre Software Meeting aims at allowing designers
and developers of free software projects [1] from different places to
meed and and share their ideas and experiences.  LSM is also an
opportunity to discuss societal issues. Technical conferences cover a
wide range of topics, from high-level programming languages to
databases, through security concerns.

The "operating system design and development" topic is looking for
speakers to present free software projects.  Technical topics include
(but are not limited to):

  * design and implementation of operating systems: architecture,
    services, libraries, use of high-level languages and advanced
    programming techniques such as AOP, dynamic reconfiguration, etc.;

  * kernel subsystems: schedulers, I/O schedulers, virtual memory
    management, etc.;

  * filesystem implementation: journalized, distributed filesystems,
    etc.;

  * realtime extensions to free operating systems;

  * virtualization tools (i.e. Xen, User-Mode-Linux, etc.);

  * kernel development tools : debuggers, performance evaluation, etc.;

  * distributed operating systems;

  * embedded systems development.

Programs of previous years are available online [2].  The program for
2005 is being defined and a tentative program is available online [3].

There is no programme committee (it is not a scientific conference)
and selection process is expected to remain as lightweight as
possible.

Volunteers should contact Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@enix.org>
and Ludovic Court=E8s <ludovic.courtes@laas.fr> by June 2005.  Speakers
are encouraged to write a small paper (6 to 12 A4 sheets) summarizing
their presentation (in an open format such as PostScript or PDF).

Ludovic Court=E8s and Thomas Petazzoni.
