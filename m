	All of these 'lack of choice' arguments aren't really about lack of choice.
They're about advantages that outweight disadvantages. How can you choose
not to eat strawberry ice cream if it's so good and your local ice cream
store doesn't carry pralines n' cream?

	These arguments are fine to make, but all they really say is that you
prefer to use Microsoft software to the other alternatives because the other
alternatives are deficient in various fundamental ways.

	It's hard to understand the point of such arguments. Surely you shouldn't
be upset at someone for providing you the best option you have, should you?
