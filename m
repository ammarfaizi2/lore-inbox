Hi There


Do you have any kids going to college or university?
====================================================


How would you like to help their education?

You know they need their own Laptop computer nowadays.

Yes I know, a couple of grand is a lot to come up with.

But how about £200 ?

Don't you think they are worth a small investment to give 
them a chance.?

Here is your opportunity to MAKE THEIR DAY and give them 
a fair start in life.

             -----------------

I recently bought a large quantity of ex-lease laptop
computers from a major bank'

Because of the price, I can see them as being suitable 
for students, looking for a budget computer. Being Compaq, 
I am also happy to sell them because of the quality.
