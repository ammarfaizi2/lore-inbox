Largest and most recognized brands are working to make you 100% happy with this stuff.. WATCHES - NEW YEAR PRESENTS. Prompt delivery. Answer your demands using this lovely thing. Satisfy your sexual appetite. http://ca.geocities.com/camron1gfj/  Zeal without knowledge, is fire without light. Caught between a rock and a hard place. If you would enjoy the fruit, pluck not the flower . Strike while the.. bug is close. There's no place like home.. Seven-fifths of all people do not understand fractions A fool gives; a wise man takes. A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness.. The bigger they are, the harder they fall . Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you
 A friend to all is a friend to none.  He who plays with fire will get burnt 
You never know what you can do until you try  Never be afraid to sit awhile and think .
