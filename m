Maybe this was at least partially the impetus behind his recent
departure from the company.  And if not the impetus, a possible straw
that broke the camel's back.

How fast will cpus be when Sun actually deploys this stuff?

A commodity x86 U1 box at that time will probably have 6+ GHZ
cpus in it, and super-duper-DDR or whatever the current memory
technology will be.  Why do I need Sun's TOE crap in this box?
Where's all that precious CPU I need to be saving?

This stuff isn't really useful for huge database servers either.

Where do they plan to do, put Solaris10 on iSCSI drives?  ROFL! :)

These days Sun is already several laps behind before the green flag
even comes out to start the race.
