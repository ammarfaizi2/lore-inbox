BREAKING NEWS:  HOUSTON, Nov 7, 2003 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Pediatric
Prosthetics  Goes Public Through a Reverse Merger and will be trading unde=
r
the symbol PDPR. 


BREAKING NEWS:  LAKE HARMONY, PA, Nov. 13, 2003 (MARKET WIRE via COMTEX) -=
-
The OTC Report Starts Pediatric Prosthetics Inc. (OTC: PDPR) with a Buy
Rating and announces that the company will now be trading under the symbol=

PDPR. 



THE NATIONAL PROSTHETICS INDUSTRY

The national prosthetics industry is estimated at nearly $2 billion annual=
ly
and is extremely fragmented. PDPR is a New Public Company and has already
developed a strong hold in the Infant-Pediatric Prosthetics segment. This
infant segment, ages 0 to 14 comprise of 5% or $100 million of the total $=
2
billion national prosthetic market. 

PDPR developed this strong hold on this segment by focusing on the
infant-pediatric prosthetics segment. PDPR was conceived and designed to
address this segment, which requires specialized expertise to meet the nee=
ds
of these babies and their families.

PDPR, a New Public Company, hopes to repeat the success of another in the
prosthetics industry, Hanger, Inc. Hanger, Inc. is currently trades on the=

NYSE under "HGR", has a market cap of approx. $340 million and trades at
around $16.



If a child lost an arm in an accident, the entire national medical communi=
ty
would go into high gear. They do everything to try to replace the loss, an=
d
as quickly as possible. PDPR knows that accidents happen before birth too.=

One tiny fiber, designed to support the fetus in the mother's womb,
sometimes breaks, and somehow loops around the baby's tiny little arm or
leg, and keeps it from developing. Sometimes an unknowable and unfortunate=

combination of genes can cause the loss.

These losses have created a need in the industry that must be filled to
enable these infants the best chance to develop.

PDPR is the only infant-pediatric prosthetics company focusing on the uniq=
ue
needs of these babies born with a limb loss.



INFANT-PEDIATRIC PROSTHETICS MARKET

Children ages 0 to 14 comprise 5% of the total $2 billion prosthetic marke=
t,
$100 million. The vast majority of this 5% pediatric prosthetic market
derives from babies born with a limb loss. 

There are approximately 145,000 first time amputations each year, meaning
first time fittings. Of these 145,000 first time amputations, less than 1=
%
or approximately 1,000 babies born with a limb loss. 

PDPR is the only infant-pediatric prosthetics company focusing on these
unique needs.

The vast majority of the Prosthetists are overworked, fragmented and work
out of a single clinic with an intensely local focus. PDPR believes that t=
o
address this dispersed market, it must be done on a national scale creatin=
g
a national presence in order to serve the geographically dispersed demand.=

PDPR is the vehicle conceived and designed to fill that role.



MARKET POTENTIAL

By focusing on the infant-pediatric need, PDPR will generate a consistent
revenue stream by servicing their clients from childhood to adulthood. Thi=
s
"annuity effect" should compound earnings year after year and enable PDPR =
to
enjoy stable growth. 

After the initial "first infant fitting", each child will need a "re-socke=
t"
of the prosthesis each of the next two years due to simple fact of growth.=

Every third year a child will need a complete "new myoelectric system" wit=
h
new larger components. This cycle will continue into the child's early
adolescence, 13 to 14 years of age, after which growth slows requiring onl=
y
a "re-socket" every two years and a "new system" perhaps every 4 years.

The economic cost from infancy to adulthood is anticipated to be over
$200,000 for a below elbow amputee. Adults will spend an additional $200,0=
00
on their artificial arms. Revenue growth is directly correlated with the
physical growth of the children. PDPR's management model for growth combin=
es
the strength and expertise of upper and lower extremity specialists with
over 50 years of combined experience.



PDPR MANAGEMENT TEAM

Eighteen years ago, Linda Putback-Bean, President of PDPR, was involved wi=
th
fitting the very first baby with a new small myoelectric hand. Shortly aft=
er
this fitting, Linda with Mr. Haslam, designed a new system for the small
prosthesis, and trained the child and parents how to operate and maintain
it. That child has since grown to young manhood and is now a star player o=
n
his high school varsity football team. 

The management team of PDPR is nationally recognized as the leading
prosthetists in the infant-pediatric prosthetics field. PDPR's management
has recently been featured in, "Orthotics & Prosthetics Business News",
written up in "Life Magazine", and some of the fitted children have appear=
ed
on national TV shows, including "Good Morning America", "Maury Povich",
"Phil Donahue", and "20-20".

With thousands of successful fittings, the prosthetics team for PDPR is
poised to give the most cost effective service to their clients, emphasizi=
ng
not only their attention to the needs of children and their parents, but
also explain how PDPR is dedicated to utilizing used components to serve
disadvantaged children.



FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

The PDPR management team is nationally recognized and without question the=

leading prosthetists in infant-pediatric prosthetics.

PDPR has developed a strong niche in the nearly $2 billion a year industry=

by focusing on specialized infant-pediatric prosthetics. 

PDPR is the only company focusing solely in the National needs of the
Infant-Pediatric Prosthetics

By targeting the infant-pediatric need, PDPR will generate a consistent
revenue stream by servicing their clients from childhood to adulthood. Thi=
s
"annuity effect" should compound earnings year after year and enable PDPR =
to
enjoy stable growth.
