Maybe you're right, but to the point of the conversation, 'taint worth
it to fight it.

The worst thing anyone can do is go off half cocked, make a challenge,
and *poof*, the protocol gateways disappear, because now Larry is

gateways.

So, in essence, I say pick the battles that are worth fighting, and then
only the battles that are worth winning.
