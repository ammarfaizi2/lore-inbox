Wrong. Its a common misconception. The GPL requires I make source
available to those I give the binaries, be it a box on a supermarket
shelf or a one of product for a client.

In fact the GPL has to do this because it is really import that the
author is not hit with the cost of third party distribution. What the
author cannot do is forbid that third party distribution.

In Linksys case dumping the required source on the end of the CD of
goodies that comes with the kit and including a notice would be
sufficient.
