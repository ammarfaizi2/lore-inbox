THIS DOES NOT EXIST. I AM NOT DOING THIS. THIS IS A SUGGESTION.

I've done some of the harder parts, but I personally am not going to
saddle them with a unixoid kernel at this point without severe
provocation. YMMV.

                          PUPLinux

                Personable UniProcessor Linux

                1.2.14 umbilical snip version

FEATURISMING...

        * based on Linux 1.2.13
        * ignores POSIX. Aims to further the unix tradition of innovation,
                in conjunction with innovations from Forth, Amiga, and
                <your name here>.
        * converted entirely to the osimplay meta-assembler
                o Therefor builds, if necessary, with nothing but a
                        32 bit post-Korn shell. No dd even. Includes one.
                o Is also therefor x86-only, and 386-max, at least at
                        first, but not nearly to the extent that you think.
        * No SMP ever, guaranteed. Not one ASCII byte.
        * EOL = CR,LF
        * dyndufs, appropriate ls included, shows the du of a dir, not the
                        less-than-useless 1970 legacy noise the
                        innocent user sees now for a dir's "size"
                o block sizes from one byte to Sagans in powers of 2
        * Forth or similar in kernelspace (H3sm and/or Tiny OpenBoot)
        * hard realtime service on NMI
        * More stateful vt's; per-vt text modes, fonts, etc.
        * Dotted Standard File Hierarchy support, DSFH
        * No modules
        * probably no threads, but I'm not sure.
        * Plan-9-style CPU-based "includes" structure, to the extent
                that that pertains to a meta-assembler
        * (back-port?) full UTF-8 support
        * stdaux, FD 3, secondary input for all executables
        * latched (level-triggered) interrupts
        * Forth interpreter syscall(s) on INT 0x81

"Doc, GUIs aren't putting Linux on the desktop."
"Of course not. The GUI didn't put Windows on "the client". Try the above,
and call me in the warm new glorious light of morning."

My apologies to the perps if there's a real "PUPLinux" somewhere.
You didn't know penguins had umbilical cords, did you? Ain't l-k grand?
