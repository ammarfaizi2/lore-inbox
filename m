Good Morning,
I'm a Customer of a broadband ISP in Italy; They sell ont only the
connection, but they add VoIP Phone and TVoIP. (Both TV on Demand and TV
Broadcasting).
I bought a Video Station branded by my carrier and surprisingly I found
that the operating system the use is a modified version of linux.
It was possible for me to see it because the Videostation Itself is just
a PC with an Ethernet Card on it and it does boot from remotely.
I sniffed tftp traffic upon boot and in it it is possible to recognize
linux, over that the / dir is mounted over NFS and it was possible for
me to see more and more file belonging to it.
I then asked my seller if they use linux on my VideoStation and call
center tell me yes, but the call center people don't know where to find
source code of their linux version.
I contacted the the real producer of the videostation but they told me
the the contract they have with the carrier told they sell without OS
videostatiuons to them.
What to do now ?

The Videostation is produced by
http://www.telsey.com/
Product is
http://www.telsey.com/products/product.jsp?pid=254&fid=13
The ISP is

Sorry but this page is just in Italian.

Hope this could help in resolving it

Bye
