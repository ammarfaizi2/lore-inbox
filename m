Hi,

	I have a question about AMD AthlonXP and AthlonMP:
What motherboards do you recomend for building an Atlon based network
server that will run 24/7 365days a year under high loads ? I need a rock
solid motherboard that can support at least 2GB of RAM, and optionally
integrated video card onboard.


Thanks!
