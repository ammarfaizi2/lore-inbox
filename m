Just for the record, "operating system", and "kernel" are used as 
synonyms in the research literature. If you open a textbook on 
"operating systems" or look at the contents of the proceedings
of  Operating Systems conferences, you will not find many discussions
of text editors, compilers, or other programming tools.  Generally, the operating
system is considered to stop at the system call interface.

One of the revolutionary features of UNIX was that it was relatively
agnostic about "tools". 
Oddly enough, the two most active campaigners for expanding the 
definition of operating system are the FSF and Microsoft.

I think that Richard's usage of "operating system" is based on 
Digital Equipment Corp. terminology from the prehistorical times
of releases on tape.

(1) GNU Programming System. 
or
(2) GPL Programming Layer 

You should be able to get US military funding because these are  recursive
TLAs. The GPL expansion to "GPL Programming Layer" so that  GPL becomes
a context sensitive recursive TLA should be enough to get an entire Homeland
Security program dedicated to the project. 

Please feel free to use this idea without restriction.  In fact, this is released
under "I don't want to have anything to do with it" license.
