It may be that that is the one called sun12x22.psfu in kbd-1.05.
I think I first took your first version and later replaced it
with your latest version. Perhaps I did some work on it myself
as well, but maybe that was first for kbd-1.06. There was also
a Polish contribution for kbd-1.06, so the 1.06 version will have
a few more symbols, I think.
