Hi....

I have Redhat Linux 7.1 running on a pentium 133 system...I recently 
attempted to upgrade my kernel from v2.4.2 to v2.4.4.  I applied a patch and 
recompiled the kernel.  When I rebooted I get the following...

Loading linux.......................
Uncompressing Linux...Ok, booting the kernel

Then the system just hangs.....I am wondering if anyone could help me 
resolve this problem....
I am new to linux, but I am very interested in getting good at it.

Please Cc me with any suggestions....Thankx
