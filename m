This was tried, trust me. We didn't create this list because someone
forgot to respond to a single posting. As we wrote in the announcement
there has been too many incidents: At least two people got kicked off
the old lvm list for posting comments about the latest release using
lower bits in pointers to store data. Other people have posted patches
for serious bugs like NULL pointer dereferences and the postings were
denied. Another person complained about the behavior and got no
response.

For modules included in the Linux kernel, an open development forum is
a minimum requirement.
