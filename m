You mean some junk in the Constitution that Bush never read?

Somebody who targets civilian airliners to "protect certain assets",
thereby denying innocents the "due process" guaranteed by the
Constitution, certainly in unconcerned with mere legality. This
is not only illegal and immoral, it's even insane. The current
President of the United States has committed treason against the
Constitution and People of the United States of America and the
average American, having sold his birthright for the promise of
a job, remains sleeping in comfort.

Next they will come for your neighbor.
