Maxtor has a perminant entry on my shitlist following their 60% failure
rate with their SATA drives (in bulk.)  And seeing how Dell no longer
builds systems with Maxtor drives adds weight to my listing :-) (Unless
they are getting a damn good OEM deal from WD, I don't think cost was why
they switched.  Even Tivo switched to WD after the Maxtor/Quantum merge.)
