Hi,

I own a laptop which has no serial ports anymore, so I want to use
IrDA to synchroize my Palm.

So, every time I press the "software Hotsync Button" on my Palm and I
get to my IrDa "port", I get the following kernel oops (2.4.20):

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
 printing eip:
