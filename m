First mistake:
	your security administrator relied on the firewall for protection.
It is an _aid_ to security; not the 'be all and end all'. IOW, the hosts
weren't hardened to resist penetration in case the firewall didn't cover
it.

Second mistake:
	your security administrator didn't make known the changes taking
place, so that clueful users could have taken some preventative steps on
their UNIX boxes.

Third mistake:
	your security administrator either didn't know about; didn't care
about; or didn't act on security problems for linux and solaris -- which
have been posted, discussed, and addressed on many general or OS-specific
security lists.

Fourth mistake:
	your security administrator, rather than address the problems, is
sticking his head in the sand and mumbling 'Windows' -- which, as an OS,
is a christmas tree where every bauble says 'please hack me!'.

In short, your security administrator needs to be dragged out, shot, and
left hanging by the front door as a warning to his replacement.

Or, at least fired.
