In Germany swapping music for free except for limited copies to friends
(for which you pay with every harddisk or CD or CD burner you buy) has
been illegal for _many_ years.  The part of current German copyright law
that says that the highest penalty for copyright infringement are three
years in prison is unchanged since 1974.

Current German copyright law says you are allowed to reverse engineer
under certain circumstances a program you are a licensee of to produce
independent programs that interoperate with this proprietary program.
Otherwise it would often be impossible to develop software like Samba
that has to interoperate with proprietary products - how easy would it
be to forbid something like this in the licence terms of the proprietary
program. Since the licensee is often in a very weak position compared to
the company selling the software current German copyright law says that
any contractual appointments that disallow the allowed cases of reverse
engineering are void.

Both rules make sense to me and whether I like them or not I am smart
enough to see the difference between these two cases.
