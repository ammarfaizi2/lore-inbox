If the game is good enough, it isn't pirate proof. I believe that Blizzard
and other such companies have pursued this course in the past. The result?
The hackers watch the communication between the client and the server and
write their own servers. They even go so far as to pretend as if the practice
is legal by putting disclaimers on the "public servers" that state that
"you may only connect to this service if you have purchased a valid license
for this game." Of course, they don't verify license keys...
