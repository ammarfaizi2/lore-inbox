Hello, good to hear from you again!

Do you already have a dedicated page up, or are you just going to keep
things there? This sounds like a very useful bit of information to get,
especially given my direct experience with the (lack of) documentation
of this issue, and perhaps worthy of its own microproject...

IIRC on linux-m68k or somewhere someone told me it was binutils-2.9.1
and gcc-2.95.3 for m68k (which I'm sure you've already heard, just
trying to air it out here).

I myself am especially interested in seeing the results of this as I,
too, have a variety of architectures in the house.


Thanks,
Bill
