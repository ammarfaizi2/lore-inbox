Not in my book.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody who tells me that one KB 
of memory or disk is 1,000 bytes is a liar.  When a disk manufacturer chooses 
to interpret KB in such a way as to make their disk seem bigger, I just say 
to myself "ok, they lied, that's what they do, they're in business and they 
don't care".  Now could we just ignore the self-serving doublespeak 
promulgated by greedy manufacturers, and continue using KB please?

Kilo, as in memory -> 1024
Kilo, as in distance or weight -> 1,000

Difficult?

/me wonders when the kibblebytes thread is going to end
