Yes, I know. The second one came from vger.kernel.org, but did not originate there. In fact, upon looking at the second one again, it came through the mailing
list:

I don't think HTML should be there either.

Sorry, actually, what I typed is not really what I meant. Both e-mails were in a foreign language that I don't speak (or read). Quickly glancing at the first
one, seeing where it was from (the mailing list), I thought the link might be a benchmark, patch, or some kernel related info. I clicked and it was none of the
above.

The second one I didn't make that mistake with (and the subject told me not to anyway).

(Oh, and I do run with no Java, Javascript, cookies, etc. enabled)
