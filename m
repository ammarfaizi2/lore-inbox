They're STILL distributing Linux.

  ftp://ftp.sco.com/pub/updates/OpenLinux/3.1.1/Workstation/CSSA-2003-020.0/SRPMS/linux-2.4.13-21D.src.rpm

I got the url from
  http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=10018
which is itself an interesting article: it reports on an anonymous

And I checked, the file is still there.
