Hi!!

Is there any way I can have 8K block sizes in ext2, reiserfs or ext3.

I am trying to install Oracle on Linux with 8K DB_Block_size.
But it gives me a Block size mismatch saying that the File BlockSize is only
4K

Maybe, there is a kernel patch available which enables Linux to create 8K
file blocks.
Thanks in anticipation....

Regards,
Anish Srivastava
