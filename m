That's right, extreme linux has been around for years, and now they've
changed the name to Scyld Linux at www.scyld.com .. I managed to pick up
a couple of cds of scyld linux at lwe a couple of weeks ago.. I have yet
to install it but i did boot it up.... all i can say is SHWEEET!! found
my ata66 stuff right off the bat... it's based on redhat 6.2 but they've
made some VERY nice changes to the installation procedure... on top of
that, you only really need to install it on the master node... just boot
the cd in all of the slave nodes for each to become a node. no hard
drives required. :)
