This is the same I think, but not Linux specific:

------------------------------------------------------------------

P. Mc Namara 12 Jul 06: about the OHF foundation providing
"certificates" for hardware, I'd propose (...) levels.

    * First, any company that pledges full and complete interface and
behavioral documentation for a device, any docs necessary to make the
device do everything it is designed to do, and makes it publicly
available under nothing more cumbersome than the basic copyright that
exists on all written works receives one certificate. Somebody else
used "community friendly" or something similar. I don't know what to
call it. Perhaps just "Open Documentation" (...)

    * A company that contributes back to the community during the
development of a device get labeled "Community Supporter" or something
similar.

    * A company that enters into a legal agreement to release the
entire RTL and supporting information for a project at a given point in
the future (far enough ahead to protect the companies commercial
viability) can get the "Open Hardware" certificate.
