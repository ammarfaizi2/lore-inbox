Maybe because HTTP and FTP is usually easier to get, the downloads are
faster if you have a fast mirror and ibiblio.org is already posting
the kernels on BitTorrent, eg. for 2.6 you have these:
http://torrent.ibiblio.org/browse.php?docid=42

Also checkout other things they post, including video lectures:
http://torrent.ibiblio.org

No problem, ibiblio.org has :-)
