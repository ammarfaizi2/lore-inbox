And this last statement pulls my trigger, Chase.  Admittedly, the kernel is 
not the whole of linux, and never has been, but without it, where are we?

Based on that, I find the attitude of the FSF to be downright overbearing 
when they expect each and every one of the KERNEL developers to go get an 
account and go through all the lollygagging around it takes to actually 
leave a message through the channels the FSF expects you to use.  I don't 
care what you call it, it boils down at the end of the day to a PITA.

I'm here as a lurker, and potentially a small bit of wisdom based on 
nothing more than my somewhat advanced age, but it seems to me that if the 
FSF wanted real input from the guys & gals submitting patches on a daily 
basis, then they owed it to ALL of you to come to this list and ASK!  AND 
GIVE WEIGHT TO THE ANSWERS GIVEN.  The fact that they didn't do this in an 
open discussion forum such as this, speaks whole sets of encyclopedias 
vis-a-vis their apparent consideration (or should I say disdain?) for 
those that do the real work.

This, FSF & RMS, is all about 'open' source, so bring the discussion to an 
'open' forum instead of treating the movers & shakers present here in such 
large numbers as just so much rabble, to be blown away with the water 
cannon of your so-called legal wisdom when we get unruly.

Well, seeing as how we must be rabble, now we've been roused.  Bring your 
arguments to the table and let a consensus, if indeed there can be one, 
gradually form in a manner that all can at least agree to disagree on.

And do it in plain language that even some who do not speak english as a 
first language can easily understand.  We need comprehension, not 
legaleze.
