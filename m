Yeah, like you're trying to make money.  Which is fine.  But if that 
"application" needs to use the RT/Linux patent in order to work, it
either has to buy a license or be GPLed.

It's somewhat two faced that the protesters here are arguing that
everything has to be free in order for Linux to be used as a RT platform,
but then come back and complain that the FSMlabs patent says everything
has to be free if you don't want to pay.

Maybe Victor should have used a different model: if no money changes hands,
then it's free to use the patent, if money changes hand, FSMlabs wants a 
cut.  I think that was the intent, but as with all things, it's hard to 
state that clearly in a legal document.  If that was the intent, I support
it, I think it's perfectly reasonable.
