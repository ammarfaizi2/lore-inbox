Well, let's not rely on anonymous sources and go straight to the web 
site, shall we?

Ordering copies of the spec, for non-members:
http://www.infinibandta.org/specs/How_to_Order_IBTA_Specifications.pdf

Key note:  use of spec is only granted for NON-COMMERCIAL use


Now, let's look at the membership agreement for IBTA:
http://www.infinibandta.org/meminfo/mem-agreement.pdf

Key note:  The point is made repeatedly that there are no patent grants 
simply by being a member.
