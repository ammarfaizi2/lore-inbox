A) Lots of BK users here.
B) We like people to stay up to date (we got burned by some user getting us
   to debug a problem that we had long since fixed).
C) I've been yelled at for not broadcasting about new releases (and now 
   I'm yelled at for doing so.  Sigh).

It would be nice if you suggested a better approach, I'm at a loss as to
how to keep everyone happy.
