Hold it! Who is acquainted with Linux 2.6.15-rc*, Jens or you?

This childish discussion who started bitching isn't going to take you anywhere.

It is *your* library, I have no interest in it as long as CD writing
works at the moment. Either do your research or ask the public, I'm not
going to answer or research this for you.

It is not helpful that you are (1) talking about ATAPI tapes under the
CD subject and (2) claim you know better than Linux (or Jens, for that
matter) if you haven't researched this.

If you want to talk about libscg's access methods to all kinds of
devices besides CD/DVD, start a new discussion please.

And it is about time that you stopped spamming people who explicitly
stated "No Cc:" such as Jens Axboe and Lee Revell.
Not minding these requests is rude.
