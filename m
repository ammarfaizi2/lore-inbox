If you want to sign a NDA and can justify the need they may given them to
you, but most people in open source can not stomach or take the three year
liablity of the NDAs generally issued in the storage industry.  They are
also one-way and have guides that whatever you create you generally loose
rights.

So please feel free the join the game and ask.  The water is warm.

Cheers,
