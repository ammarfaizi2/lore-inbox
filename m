Hi, folks. I would love to bang on the latest 2.5.x revs but unfortunately I
need an updated initio driver. My attempts at a compile all bomb with the
current initio code. Since the freeze is coming up, could somebody please find
whomever is responsible for this driver and ask them to write it to the new
specs? I would do it myself but I can't code!!
