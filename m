GIT 1.0.0 is found at the usual places:

	Tarball	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
	RPM	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/RPMS/
	Debian	http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/debian/
	GIT	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/

The name "1.0.0" ought to mean a significant milestone, but
actually it is not.  Pre 1.0 version has been in production use
by the kernel folks for quite some time, and the changes since
1.0rc are pretty small and primarily consist of documenation
updates, clone/fetch enhancements and miscellaneous bugfixes.

Thank you all who gave patches, comments and time.

Happy hacking, and a little early ho-ho-ho.
