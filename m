I'll ask Intel if there's a BIOS update. Computers are almost as bad as
games now; the first thing you need to do before using them is patch!

What evokes my curiosity is that the 2.5.51 kernel detects and correctly
uses the processor siblings, while 2.4.20 does not. Given that 2.5.51 is
running quite well, I think I'll just stay on the bleeding edge of Linux for
a while.
