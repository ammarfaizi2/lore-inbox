I've dealt with "you've gotta run" before.  I had the required
hardware & software running over in the corner, with shared disk space
or remote access from the linux box on the desktop.  It wasn't easy,
but I simply stuck to my insistance that I _needed_ this (only one
example required) and that I was meeting the company's requirements.
Nowdays, that situation is on my checklist to determine if I want to
work there.

The really funny thing about the initial email is the amount of
interest in the followups and their meanderings.
