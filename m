It all depends on how much risk you want to take and how
much you have to lose.

If all you can lose is some of your own time and energy
there's nothing wrong with attempting something where
everybody else has failed over the last 15 years.

On the other hand, I wouldn't take that risk if I were
running a business and had to make money to live...

Rik
