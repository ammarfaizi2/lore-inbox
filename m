 After recently reading Mr. Stallman's online *BLURB*
at www.stallman.org, specifically the diary entry
on June 28th 2003, I am disturbed, I would like to
work on helping you people move to a OSL licence,
work out copyright owners and add the OSL option to each 
individual file one by one.

 I am willing to pay to track down unfindable people.

 This license does not lose you any additional freedoms,
in fact it is more legally secure so it gains you
legal security, as well as the traditional GNU freedoms
which RMS is jeopordising with a disgusting set of
*IDEALS*. 

In cases where members have died I will pay to track down their copyright "bequethers".

I will build up a copyright list for each file using BK 
and the CHANGELIST/SET files, as well as listed file
copyright holders in that file.
