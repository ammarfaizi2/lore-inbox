We can create an "offtopic@vger.kernel.org" list for
everyone who want to discuss on topics which are way
off from whatever current Subject: line is.

For that matter, if you folks want, we can even
create a  "catfight@vger.kernel.org"  list for
name-calling and other anti-social kind of
behaviours.


This topic is NOT available for public discussion.
If you want to plead on listowners, send your plea
to  postmaster@vger.kernel.org

Doing to group-reply including the list shows only
that you can not follow instructions.
