You must be thinking of nvidia's kernel module...

With the new module licenes, they do not keep you from loading or even
making the modules.  It just lets the community know that they don't need to
support bug reports from these kernels.

The *seperate* issue of gpl symbols will also not affect current symbols,
only new symbols that people add in the future.

PS, I don't think our community needs people who jump to colclusions like
this.  Have you even read LKML?!
