I don't mind trying to compile release kernels on a PPC box, however
when I send a bug report to LKML, everyone shoots it down and tells me
to use someone else's source tree.

If people do not care about PPC in the kernel, should it be included in
the source, or should I just forget about trying to use the 'stock'
kernel and use someone else's PPC source tree (which are usually a few
versions behind) in order to compile the kernel?
