Sorry; I must have misunderstood.  But I think lwn.net 
misunderstood, too; http://lwn.net/2001/1213/kernel.php3
says "Marcelo's stated plan is to have the final release be the same 
as the last release candidate; the hope is to be done with surprises 
caused by last-minute patches."

I guess I and lwn.net were projecting our desires onto Marcello's statements?
