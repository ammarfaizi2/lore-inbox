This is the one and only reason why I have to strongly consider voting YES
for you proposal.  Had it been only on the merit of the GUID and CPRM had
never entered the picture it would have been a hands down YES.

And the purpose of "lawyers" is to turn a lie into truth, because it will
not stand on its own merit.  We all know this fact.  At this point in time
when people ask me for drives to buy, I can only suggest the one company
that voted NO and I hope that their sales blow through the roof as a form
of financial protest to the rest.

We can go offline with the legal issues, and the nice thing about that is
as a person you are trustworth and honest.
