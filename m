Hi there,
I updated my system from RedHat 6.0 -> RedHat 7.0 and Murphy is still
working.

[1]
 I can't compile Kernel 2.2.17 since the update. 
    (make bzImage)

[2]
Error Message:
make[2]: Entering directory '/usr/src/linux-2.2.17/arch/i386/lib'
cc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.2.17/include -D__ASSEMBLY__ -D__SMP__

make[1] Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux-2.2.17/arch/i386/lib'
make: *** [dir_arch/i386/lib] Error 2


The running system with 2.2.17 crashes sometimes - no error Messages - 
System freezes - only Hardwarereset works.

I tried to compile version 2.2.16 - it works - no errors !
