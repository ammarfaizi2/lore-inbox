So much for self-regulation. I don't mind having the odd flamefest, since
every now and then something good comes out of them that goes beyond the
entertainment value.

However, I am very concerned about the state of a community that has its
members turn to their respective lawyers to ask for backup. Not only does
it reflect badly on our ability to resolve disputes, it also implies that
there is more than a loose relation between what is legal and what is
Right(TM), which is BS.

I contend that quoting lawyer advice in a flamewar on a community list
should automatically invoke Godwin's law, and just to be on the safe side,
I let it be known that you all sound like a bunch of Nazis. EOT.

Roger
