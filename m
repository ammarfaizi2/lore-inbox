The repository linux24.bkbits.net is only at 2.4.19-pre3; however, the kernel 
test directory is at 2.4.19-pre4.  I seem to remember that when we had this 
problem with the 2.5 repository it was a scripting issue.

Anyway, could someone with access to the relevant sites fix it?

Thanks,

James Bottomley
