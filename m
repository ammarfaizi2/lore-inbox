Hi,

This may be a little off topic to the kernel list and may belong on a
linux-raid mailinglist, if so I  will apologise now :)

I have a client with an IBM Netfinity 5500 server which is based on a
ServeRAID 2 controller (Adaptec make the controller chip I believe)

Just wondering what the reliability and stableness of the driver for this
particular hardware is like in either 2.2 or 2.4 series kernels as linux
appears to be one of our only choices for its destined task.

It maybe best to reply off list if question is off topic?

Regards, Jim.
