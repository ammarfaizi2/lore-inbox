cox.net, you mean -- that's the domain name for e-mail accounts on Cox
High-Speed Internet (which replaced Cox@Home).

I don't remember the exact details; I think AT&T tried to buy it but the
@Home bondholders managed to kill the deal with their legal manuverings,
or something to that effect. So, AT&T never got to buy @Home.

No, it was liquidated at the beginning of the month -- AT&T never owned
it.

Because you're on AT&T's own network now, the same way that Thomas Molina
and I are on Cox's own network, etc.
