Wrong  (assuming you want to include the UK as part of Europe :-)

UK Copyright Designs and Patent Act,  1988 (as ammended)

50C.--(1)  It  is not an infringement of copyright for a lawful user of
           a copy of a computer program to copy or adapt it,  provided
           that the copying or adapting-
   
   (a) is necessary for his lawful use; and
   (b) is  not  prohibited under any term or condition of an agreement
       regulating the circumstances in which his use is lawful

   (2)  It  may, in particular, be necessary for the lawful use of a
        computer program to copy it or adapt it for the purpose of
        correcting errors in it.

... and the above is from a copyright regime which is in general quite
draconian.

OK - So now you get to argue about EULAs,  but that's a seperate issue.
