Linux is a copy of Unix.  There is very little new stuff in Linux.
All of the innovation is built on top of a copy of a commercial work.

To date, nothing remotely as influential as Unix has come out of the
open source community.  Sure, there are a ton of copies of existing work,
that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about new things.  I keep
coming back to this because some of you refuse to get it.  It costs A LOT
OF MONEY TO MAKE NEW STUFF.  Because we are stupid, we all make a lot of
mistakes, we throw away those mistakes.  The free software model doesn't
generate 1/1000th of the money it would take to make progress continue
at its current rate in the software world.  Don't believe me?  Cool.
Go start a company, GPL your work, get back to me in 5 years and show
me how well it worked.

Other than distributions, where are those free software success stories?
Oh, yes, Cygnus.  They were doing about $25M/year or so when redhat bought
them.  Whoopee.  And Red Hat, *with* Cygnus, is doing all of $80M/year.
And we all agree that they are the leader in the free software financial
success stories, right?  Who's bigger?  IBM?  Let's see, spent $1B and
by their own statements "almost have made that back".  Hmm, running at
a loss but going to make it up on volume.

Now let's compare to some closed source companies:

	Company		Factor more revenue than Red Hat
	Microsoft	370
	Oracle		116
	Sun		150

You get the idea.  Sun makes more in 2 days than Red Hat makes all year.
It doesn't even take Microsoft a whole day to make what Red Hat makes in
a year.

Indeed.  Look over your shoulder.  That's me, stepped way farther back than you.
