"Don't use in DRM'ed hardware" and "Don't use for commercial purposes" do=20
differ from "Not allowed in country X". The first two are essentially the=20
same (as far as I am aware, DRM has no use for F/OSS, it is made for=20
commercial stuff). They protect the freedom of the software. The third=20
(!country) is something different since it attacks the freedom of the=20
software. Equivalents (or similar thoughts) would be "Don't use in DRM'ed=20
hardware", "Don't use for commercial purposes" and "Use in any country you=
=20
want".

I agree that it is a valid term. I wouldn't like to see my program running =
on=20
some obscure DRM'ed hardware when I made it to be free.

As far as I can see, Linus wants to allow usage of Linux in DRM'ed hardware=
=20
(for ex. future mobile phones). He wants to allow usage, but he hopes that=
=20
the customers would make companies disband DRM (and similar=20
crypto/obscure/... stuff). If that is the case, I don't agree with his=20
oppinion that the customers could do anything. Most of the "customers" have=
=20
no problem with DRM, and look-a-likes. Most of the customers still use m$ w=
in=20
and office, and others think that os x is an free/open operating system.

> Besides that, I pretty much agree with the rest of your mail.

I do too, but I don't think that "To stop it, just don't buy any of it." is=
=20
the solution of the problem. It would be a solution if most of the customer=
s=20
would do so.
