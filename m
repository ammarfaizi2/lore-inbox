Hummm... I guess this is because yoiu see new (development, pre, ...)
kernels each few days. Alan said he gets mosly line shifts (==
non-overlapping patches, or "people should be talking to each other").
Maybe due to the rapid version turnover? Maybe most of the merging is being
done by the posters themselves during development, as Ye Kernel Gods refuse
to do it for them?

I'm surprised that commercial shops see much merging. I'd assume they have
direct access to the up-to-the-minute source, so _less_ merging should be
necesary. Or they are (over)confident in their tools, and just work on
stale sources?

I think the difference lies elsewhere.
