        I am? I'm sorry. I did not mean to anger someone who is more 
experienced and sagely than a mere fool such as myself. I suppose I'll throw 
away my Bachelor's degree in Comp. Sci from '96, all the C programs I've coded 
since 91, all the logo since '81, as well as the projects I'm currently 
working on. I am such a fool. Back to programming Zaxxon on my Apple IIe for 
me. Perhaps even Karateka.. or Spy Hunter.

        BTW: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html . Bookmark it. And come 
back when you have a better MUA. It's starting to remind me of WebTV.

                                                        BL.

        P.S.

        Kryten: There's something familiar about you, too.. I get a name...
                Smee... Smeeg Heeeeeed!!
        Rimmer: Smeghead?
        Kryten: That's it!
        Rimmer: He remembers me!!
