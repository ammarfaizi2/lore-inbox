Hello.

Just figured if anyone could give some information about resizing of software
raid5 systems (2.4.x kernels)? I've been looking all over for information about
if this is possible or not currently, and if not, how this system of raid
cluster blocks work in conjunction with ext2. The code is a bit tricky and not
too many comments to help one try and get a hold of how it works.
Any pointers for this would be nice.
