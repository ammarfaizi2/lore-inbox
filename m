But it clearly gets a very reliable flavor of electricity...

We got one to 1460 or so, then got BSOD on the controller which switches 
from the UPS to the diesel when they get up to speed, dropped power on 
the whole data center (at work).

I ran one at home from the night 1.2.13 was released (or two days after 
when a patch came out) until the afternoon before Y2K, when I decided I 
didn't want to have that system to check at midnight. It was an 8MB 
386SX-16 named "glacial" for its performance rather than because it was 
cool ;-) But it did DNS nicely, which was all I could ask.

I think you have the record, though.
