Hi all,

How it's the support of ATA100 in the linux kernel? Do I need to use 2.4
to get full speed or is enough to configure the drive with hdparm? When i
use hdparm several modes supported appear. Is udma5 equivalent to the
standard ATA100 ? And sorry if my questions are maybe too simple for this
list.

TIA
