It changes an attribute of a key, for which you have DAC checks, therefore 
you could assume that we'd also want MAC checks.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.

Not sure yet how we'll avoid generating spurious SELinux denial messages.

Ok, if a failure of this nature is generated by an LSM, we need to return 
the LSM's error code (e.g. ask the LSM for search permission and it 
returns -ENOMEM).

Ok.
