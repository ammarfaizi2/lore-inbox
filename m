This is consumer hardware. Consumer products are optimized for a
good buzzword count per $ ratio. Everything else is secondary.

Producing cheap stuff has its price. And being so smart an buing
cheapest available has the same price. QA and recalling are
expensive as hell. That's why cheap products usally have this
quality tradeoff.

Most consumers don't like to pay for quality. 

Germany has learned this lesson and thus "Made in Germany"
doesn't mean anything for certain products anymore :-(
