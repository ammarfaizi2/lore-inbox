    1. With the file system, why not charge for commercial use?

Maybe they will... but it's not something they could do under the GPL.

    2. Regards to hardware manufacturers, what have the got to lose from
       publishing the specs? nothing.

Many manufactures will claim otherwise... for some hardware products,
the useful life-cycles is only six months, if you can't make money
within that period of time, the product never will --- so there are
arguments for keeping things vague for just a little while.

Also, some hardware vendors cannot release specifications because they
don't own all the IP here either (see my earlier comments) or are part
of some kind of cartel/consortium which is overrun by labatomized
lawyers, the DVD people for example.
