Anyway, I have a more authoritative source[1], which says

	Singular
		Kate's book
		Father's pipe
		Charles's records
		Alice's cassettes
	Plural
		my parents' books
		the boys' room
		the children's toys
		men's clothes

	<Warning sign>
		My friend's bike is new.
		My friends' bikes are over there.

	<Translated> With singular, an apostrophe and an s is added
	to the noun. As for plural forms with a trailing -s, only an 
	apostrophe is added. Other plural forms get an apostrophe and an s 
	(like with singular).

	Family names ending in -s may either have apostrophe + S or just
	an apostrophe appended.

		Mrs Jones's/Jones' hats
		The Bates's/Bates' house

So in our Torvalds case, we have the option.
