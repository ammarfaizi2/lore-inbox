Hi.

I rearranged things earlier today. The latest patch versions are now all
under the 'current' sections at the top of
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=25964.

When I use -rev, I mean a revised version, just as you think, so I'd go
for

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-linux-2.6.1-rev6-whole.bz2?download

and

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swsusp/software-suspend-core-2.0-whole.bz2?download

and (as the instructions on http://swsusp.sf.net say), apply them in
that order.

Regards,

Nigel

Evolution (n): A hypothetical process whereby infinitely improbable events occur 
with alarming frequency, order arises from chaos, and no one is given credit.
