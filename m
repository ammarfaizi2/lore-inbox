                        REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP



This letter is important, and requires your immediate attention!

Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction.

 I am a top official of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel, I am
currently on official assignment here in The Netherlands. My local partners
and I are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds
which are presently trapped in an interest bearing  Federal Government
suspense account for which we need a foreign account that you have absolute
control over in your country or a third country other than Nigeria to
receive the funds.

 It was when the new civilian administration in Nigeria set up this panel to
review all contracts/ oil licenses to determine their authenticity,
propriety in the light of the economic and political realities of my country
that we identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are currently
floating in our Apex Bank. At this moment we have worked out modalities
within ourselves to transfer the sum of US$ 8,500,000,00 (Eight Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, for our personal use.

 However, by virtue of our positions as civil servant and members of the
Contract Review Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names.
Consequently, I was delegated by my colleagues as a matter of trust to look
for an overseas partner into whose account we can transfer this said money,
hence this letter to you.

 Furthermore, my colleagues are willing to transfer the total sum of
US$8,500,000,00 into your account for disbursement. Your areas of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction and the account required for this project can either be
PERSONAL, COMPANY or an OFFSHORE account, you have total control over.
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of this sum while 5% shall be set
aside for incidental expenses between the parties in the course of this
transaction. You must however, note that this transaction is subject to the
following terms and conditions:

 (1) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence,

(2) That you would treat this transaction with utmost assistance and
confidentiality.

(3) That the funds would only be transferred to an account you have absolute
control over.

(4) That the funds will be free from undue taxation

 Modalities have been worked out to the highest level for the immediate
transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your swift response
and satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance to you is that
your role is RISK FREE!. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves
and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedure will be
officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company
you may nominate as the ultimate beneficiary. Once more, I want you to
understand that having put in over 13 years in the civil service of my
country, I am averse to having my image and carrier dented. Therefore this
matter should be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency that is why I have
given you my Amsterdam tel/fax number for contact. Kindly expedite action,
to enable us include this transfer in the batch of payment to contractors
which is usually carried out on quarterly basis as scheduled.



Yours Sincerely,

 DR Abdul Kadiri
