Alan, 

It is too late to switch this one (again). However, I would be happy to 
organize another one on a different day/time for the Europeans. Andrew, 
what is the earliest in the day you can do it? Alan, how about Tuesday or 
Thursday next week? 

I would still like to try a conference call so if that is acceptable to a 
subset of participants I would be happy to organize that for the next one. 
Just think of the enjoyment from making fun of our American accents! 

Seriously, conference calls are an opportunity for the rest of the 
Kernel Community to hear each others voices and communicate in a 
different way than has been done widely before. Especially for people who
can't attend OLS. I think it will help bring people together in a way that 
email and irc can't. Maybe it's a woman thing, I dont know ;)

Hanna
