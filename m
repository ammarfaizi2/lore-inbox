I've seen machines bought from the very same batch with _completely_
different innards. BTW, around in Chile you mostly get some store-build
machine, for years all in the same box with the same logo outside. Good
luck at finding CornerStoreComputer on your database... and if you do, may
it help find out which mobo was the cheapest around when it was built.
