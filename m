Why do you think it doesn't?  I've been running 2.4.9 and then later
2.4.16 on ten boards with 760MP's for a few months with perfect
stability and reboots only for kernel upgrades and power outages
exceeding our UPS backup.  I also still run 2.2.19 on a 760MP box for
our NFS server.

BTW, all of above are with Tyan S2460.

Take care,
Daniel
