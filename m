 wrong.

 i added xattr support to fuse, for use in selinux.  it's a long story.

	 http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.2/1441.html

 and yes, for the record, i am just as comfortable with hardware
 designs as with software, having designed a massively parallel
 encryption algorithm capable of doing up to about 16384-bit
 block sizes with key sizes of up to around 8192-bits, (which
 unfortunately wasn't very fast in software - you can't have
 everything), came up with some significant improvements to
 the plessey/imperial-uni/man-uni ALICE parallel transputer
 network as a third year project, and also provided aspex,
 the massively-parallel SIMD processor company, with enough
 new material and ideas in four months for them to have to
 register six new patents.

 ... why are you people bothering to attempt to go "oh, this
 guy must not know anything therefore we'll waste the list's
 time with our opinions on whether he cannot do anything",
 such that i have to refute you, and look like a complete
 egg-head jumped-up i'm-better-than-you horn-blowing tosser?

 stop it!

 everyone has their level and areas of expertise: instead of
 turning this into a pissing contest, be glad and humbled for
 an opportunity to learn from each other.
