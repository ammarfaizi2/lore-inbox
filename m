A very good day to you.
 
I am Mr. Jonathan Mwari Zuma, an accountant and principal overseer 
with the South African Mining Corporation. I got your contact through 
a friend in my local chamber of commerce in collaboration with the  
American Consulate here in South Africa. This is in line with my quest 
for a reliable and reputable person/company to handle a very 
confidential transaction, which involves transfer of fund to a foreign 
account.
 
This said fund (US$20.5m) Twenty million, five hundred thousand United 
Statesdollars, is reportedly made to be a variation and accumulation 
of equity investment made in the South African Mining corporation in 
the period of 1983-1987. This redeemable investment interest, has now 
matured and has long been cleared for disbursement but with no 
apparent knowledge of who the investors are,  as most of the investors 
then, were corrupt government officials and their cronies under the 
obnoxious apartheid regime who used pseudo names and aliases in the 
transactions, and could not come up for claims under the present 
political setting in South Africa.
 
After due consultative sessions with my colleagues in the account 
department at the mining corporation, I discovered that none of them 
knows about the funds. So  I decided to confiscate the funds and 
placed it in a private trust company for safe keeping, awaiting 
further transfer to 
a foreign account for further business ventures. I cannot handle this 
transaction on my name because we were not allowed to operate an 
offshore account while still in service. What I need now is a foreign 
national who can assist me in the transfer of this fund, and also to 
help invest the fund in a risk free venture. if you are wi! lling to 
assist me in this transfer, I have agreed to compensate y ou with a 
certain percentage(20%) of the total sum (US$20.5m) through mutual 
negotiations. Your specialty is not a barrier to this transaction as I 
have mapped out strategies to effectively actualize this transaction.
 
Thank you for your anticipated co-operation, and I hope to hear from 
you soon, to enable me give you full details of the transactions.  And 
also remember to maintain absolute confidentiality as any leakage of 
information may jeopardize our chance of receiving this money.
 
Best regards,
Jonathan Mwari Zuma
