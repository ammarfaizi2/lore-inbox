No, I think we'd improve CVS because bk came along and showed us what we 
already knew.

Bitkeeper *is* better, but as long as the ideas those improvements are based 
on don't get patented there is no reason for us not to claim them for 
ourselves.

Summa summarum:
Having a Free CVS is good.
Having a useful BitKeeper is sometimes better.
Having a Free CVS with all the features of BK would be best.
