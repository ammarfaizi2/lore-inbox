Yes, I realized that by reading the include/linux/security.h comments
describing the security hooks. The question is rather if there is something
which all the different methods of logging in have in common that can be
caught with a LSM hook?

The reason that I wanted to do caching is that I want to add more checks
to the root_plug module. For instance, to deny all socket accept() and
connect() calls when the USB module is missing (to not break already
established connections but not allow any new ones, e.g. to lock out any
new SSH sessions).

I'm assuming that this could introduce the need for some kind of caching
of the results of the USB-device-present check as the number of checks
increase.
