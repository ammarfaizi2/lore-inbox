This is what I tested a few months ago:

Test system: 2 dual Pentium3 systems
- with 2.6.11 kernel and kernel IRQ balancing;
- each with an Intel dual port E1000 NIC (e1000 driver 6.0.54);
- both systems connected back-to-back to each other with 2 links.

Test 1:
- I started 1 UDP flow (< 23 Mbps) on the first link with the Iperf 
network performance measurement tool. For a UDP bandwidth lower than 23 
Mbps the interrupt rate at the receiver interface was lower than 2000 
interrupts per second. In this case all interrupts were distributed to 
CPU 0. 2000 interrupts per second seemed to be the threshold for the 
interrupts to be distributed to 1 CPU.

Test 2:
- Then I started 1 UDP flow of 600 Mbps on the first link. 8000 
interrupts per second were generated by the receiver interface. 
Approximately half of the interrupts were distributed to CPU 0, the 
other half to CPU 1.

Test 3:
- Then I did a test with 2 UDP flows of 600 Mbps, each over their own 
link. 8000 interrupts per second were generated by both receiver 
interfaces. All interrupts generated by the 1st interface were 
distributed to CPU 0, all interrupts generated by the 2nd interface were 
  distributed to CPU 1.
