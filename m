hello. i read linux kernel internal. are there other books/papers
like that which dwell with linux kernel in detail,especially on 
process mechanism,for example,how pthread and fork are implemented,
how clone actually work.are there other materials on these topics
on internet that can be downloaded freely.


thanks
