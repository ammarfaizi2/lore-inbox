I'm running 2.6.3 on my SX164 with no problems at all.  It's running
web and mail servers, hosts a few BK repos, and lately it's been busy
compiling a bunch of stuff.  Current uptime is 13 days after kernel
upgrade.  I've been running 2.6 kernels since January without a
glitch, so there's nothing wrong with 2.6 in general on Alphas in
general, at least.  I haven't dared try 2.6.4 after reading this
thread.
