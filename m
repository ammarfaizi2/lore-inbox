Sorry for ignoring you Andrey, I've been totally consumed on other
things until now.

Thanks for the offer but I doubt its a big enough project to warrant two
people.  I have a couple patches to a different driver to make & submit
then I'll work on this.  I hope to have a patch for this sometime next

patch, though.

Mark
