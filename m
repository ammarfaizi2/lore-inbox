Let me be equally short.  Your original message gave no details of what
debugging steps had been taken. (I can assume you would know what you're
doing, but frankly, I could be wrong.)  You venture a guess that the
system had been h4x0r3d in some inventive way to prevent your attempts
to recover data and proceed to paste error messages from the 3ware
driver that indicate a problem with the hardware (either driver bug,
cabling, controller, or channel on that controller) including the
drive itself.

Please do not attribute to hackers what is simply a half dead drive.  So,
was the machine powered down for an extended period as I aluded? (to
preserve the machine until someone had time to look at it.)
