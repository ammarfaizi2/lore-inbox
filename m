I am looking to develop a diagnostic tool for hard
disks.  I need to identify the devices.

I already have the command to issue to the command
register, how to set the device register and how to
read the data register for the information needed.

What I need to know is the port address space for the
ATA device.  Specifically the port address space of
the command bloc registers.

Any help would be much appreciated
Thank you

John
