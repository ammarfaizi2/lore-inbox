Hello Rob,

_the_ ultimate difference between someone participating and someone _running_
the business is (in my eyes) that the one "running" it is playing with his own
money, his own existence (and maybe that of his family) and possibly feels a
big responsibility for his employees, the money he was possibly given by
investors or the like. 
If you never made that experience you don't know what Larry is talking about.
If you don't believe that, take all your money and loan your house and start a
business, then experience the feeling.
You may have noticed I do not agree with Larry in many things, but anyway I
fully respect him, because he took true responsibility for running a business,
and I know what that means. There are easier things you could do in life.

Regards,
Stephan
