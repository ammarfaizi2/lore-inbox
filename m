kbuild-2.5-core-13
  Changes from core-12.

    Disable the ability to generate .[is] files on demand from the
    command line.  There are corner cases with autogenerated .[is] that
    are causing kbuild database problems so this new feature has been
    disabled for the moment.  If you try to generate a .[is] file,
    kbuild will give you instructions on how to do it by hand.

    Tweak standardize_name code to cope with aic7xxx shipping files and
    overwriting them with the same name.

kbuild-2.5-common-2.5.15-2
  Changes from common-2.5.15-1.

    Add -f to cp/mv.  Mainly to cope with aic7xxx shipping files and 
    overwriting them with the same name.

    Add missing select for aic7xxx.

kbuild-2.5-i386-2.5.15-2
  Changes from i386-2.5.15-1.

    arch/i386/pci/Makefile.in fixups.  Add acpi flags to acpi.o.  Only
    build pci objects when CONFIG_PCI=y.
