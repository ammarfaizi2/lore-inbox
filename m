OK, then - Show Us The Code.

Everyone else who have expressed an opinion believe an in-kernel 
converter to be far to difficult to get right. You disagree, and think 
it should be easy.

So write it. Show us the code. Change our minds.

You opened with a a "This should be possible". We raised you a "No, it's 
hard, here's other ways to do it." You raised with a "It should be 
easy." I call.

Let's see your cards.
