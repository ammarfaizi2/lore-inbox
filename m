Perhaps you can explain the benefits to BitMover of this "deal".  If you
are going to say that we get tons of marketing and sales from the free
use of BK, forget about it.  Sales in this product space are made at
the CEO/CTO/VP level and I can assure you they don't read this mailing
list, they don't read slashdot, and if they did they would view what
we are doing as too risky.  I tend to agree with them.

So what's the part of the "deal" that benefits BitMover?

As for the data, you are right, we don't own that.  As for the metadata
which makes BK work, that's ours, not yours.  BK made that metadata,
you did not.  If you don't like those terms, convince Linus and friends
to get off of BK.  That would be just fine with us.
