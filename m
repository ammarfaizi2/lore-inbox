Hello all,

  I have noticed that there have been alot of changes to the cciss 
driver in the last few revs of the 2.4 kernel a diff of 2.4.18 and 
2.4.20 show  this (2500 lines in a patch). But the driver version has 
not changed.  I am trying to figure out how the version in the kernel 
relates to the version on hp's web site.  On there website they have a 
2.4.34 version that has patches witch will patch the kernel that comes 
with redhat 8.0 witch doesn't help me much because that kernel is an rc 
kernel with about 100 other patches 3 of witch touch this driver.

 Can any one be of some help. I am going to be deploying alot of 
machines with this card in the next few months and would like some of 
the fetures the newer driver gets me.

Byron
