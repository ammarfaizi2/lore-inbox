Sorry I've been slow to respond... I'm going to apply your driver
locally, so you and I have a good baseline to work with, but there are
some small issues related to PCI initialization that I want to review
and discuss with you, before submitting officially to Marcelo...

(another message should follow during the upcoming work week)

Regards,

	Jeff
