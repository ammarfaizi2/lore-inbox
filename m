You can be assured I will submit proposed changes.  Something along the 
same lines as the CDDL.  Needs to protect
receivers of the code from IP claims and also needs to accomodate mixing 
of non-GPL components without
contaminating add on modules and functionality.  I would use the GPL if 
it were more acceptable along these
lines.  In case you haven't noticed, I don't have problem being 
outspoken, nor do I am subject to intimination
by the more vocal element of the FOSS community.  I am using the CDDL at 
present but a revised and more
capitalism oriented GPL would certainly be welcome.

I'll sharpen my pencil.

Jeff
