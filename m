FYI, this person just posted a private email to a public list.

Personally, I don't care, I try not to send private mails that I wouldn't
want to see out in public, and I stand 100% behind what I said to him
in private.  In fact, I feel more strongly about it now than I did before.

On the other hand, it might be useful information that this person doesn't
seem to understand the rules of the road, i.e., what is private remains
private.
