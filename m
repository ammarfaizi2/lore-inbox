As long as using only ALSA native applications, "modprobe xxx" would
be enough.  The subtle configuration is required for OSS emulation,
kmod support and card-specific module options.
Well, but it's surely better to set up module aliases and options
properly for comfortable life :)

There is another issue, that alsa mutes all volumes as default.
I know that's what sometime annoying people.  IMO, it's same on OSS
anyway, since everyone needs to set up the mixer as he likes after
start up.
