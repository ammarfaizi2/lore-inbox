I do not know from where that manual page text was quoted.


According of Ren_ Scharfe, man page text is correct on Mandrake 8.

Well, same error is on man page on this system
(Linux Mandrake release 7.1 (helium)).

So is that fixed by distributor (of Mandrake) or is it fixed by
manpage maintainer ?
