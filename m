Hi,

This is a call for interest to gauge the Linux kernel community
interest in a Kernel miniconf for the next Australian Linux 
conference.

Linux.conf.au is the annual Australian Linux conference. The 2004
conference will be held in Adelaide, South Australia in January. The 
two days preceding the conference, the facilities are available to run 
mini conferences.  People who pay to attend the main conference can
also attend the miniconfs for no extra charge.

If you are interested in presenting a paper, giving a talk or want
more information, please email me.  There is more information about
the conference at the conference web site http://lca2004.linux.org.au


Thanks
Chee Kent Lam
