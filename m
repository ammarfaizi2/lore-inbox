Anyone concerned about your right to view, listen to, and/or copy video
and/or audio that you have legally paid for should visit the URL below.
Maybe you don't care, but just remember that the law is a multi-faceted
thing. A law passed pertaining to one thing, will set a president
allowing further, more restrictive laws to pass pertaining to others.
Before you know it, we'll be living in another Stalinist state.

I have heard from some that "God will take care of me, so I won't worry
about it." God only takes care of you if you have the presence of mind
to pay attention to what's going on and act accordingly, and listen to
Him when he speaks to you. He did not create mindless, non-thinking
robots, to be lead around by the nose, but when you fail to pay
attention and act as maybe you should, that's exactly what you become.
When you allow those in power to enact laws that hurt you, and when you
vote for those people, are you really doing what God wants?

Whether you believe in God - or any higher power - or not, do you expect
someone else to make everything right for you? While you all sit back
and think "The next guy will take action and make a difference.", the
large corporations are NOT sitting back, and they ARE making a
difference, and that difference is certainly NOT in the interest of you
and me. How do you think the U.S. DMCA and the equivalent European laws
have come about? I'll tell you why, because complacent, lazy, people
have sat back and allowed the greedy corporations and other powerful
special interest groups to take control and push these laws through.
Those in power will only listen to those that actually open their
mouths, pocket books, and show up at the voting booth.

And please, no flame mails about this not being relevant to the various
mailing lists I've sent this to. If that's what you think, you have some
more thinking to do.
