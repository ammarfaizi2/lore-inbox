Well SPAM is a very big problem and I can see that David is trying.
Sometimes he has a bad day and pisses a few off with his answers.
However, in every case in which somebody that I know of has complained,
the problems did get "mysteriously" fixed so, like they say; "Don't go
away mad. Just go away!".

Once you get flammed for a few years, you get used to it. That's why
some people send email to me rather than "the list". Sometimes I am
able to help without having to forward their problems to the list.
Sometimes I have to take a work-break and can't help, and other times
I can't help because I don't know what they are talking about. Anyway
if David wants invoke the rage of the Gods, yawn... It doesn't bother
me anymore....
