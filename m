Subject: PROBLEM: 2.5.37 IDE boot hang

Hello, with kernel 2.5.37, I get the following messages on boot,
and nearly immediately after init starts running starup scripts,
the system hangs with no error message. The last thing I see is
devfsd starting up, right at the top of the boot scripts.  I have
two ide disks (hda and hdc), as well as a cdrom drive (hdd).
