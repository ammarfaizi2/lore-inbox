is there any real documentation on this syscall anywhere?  i.e. if one
wanted to write a daemon that dynamically dealt with nfs exports
(creating/removing/changing) this syscall would seem very appropriate
(at least as I understand), but I can't find any documentation besides
the skimpy man page on how to use it.

am I not supposed to use it? :)

thanks,

shaya
