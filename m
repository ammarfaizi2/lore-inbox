People who disagree with my views about free software often say that
it is ineffective for me to talk about them.  The ways they say this
are as boundless as human imagination, but the message is the same:
"No one agrees with you, no one cares, you are wasting your time, your
efforts are totally ineffective."

However, other evidence shows that some people are paying attention
even if others are not.  Talking about principles encourages people to
think about them, and that has an influence.  In the long run, it has
been very effective--merely writing code would have achieved little.

I conclude that the reason people insist so strongly that no one is
listening is precisely because that isn't so.  The aim of these
messages is to cause discouragement.  After recognizing this, one can
easily avoid believing them.

      Until it happens please assume that those who
    chose to use the tool they want are exercising their freedom

They are exercising a legal right to do something foolish and
harmful.  Freedom does not mean nobody can criticize you.
