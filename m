yes, I've seen this. He posted it while I was
reporting mine. I did it randomly to quickly
get a compiled kernel to check for another
unrelated bug so it was just a warning
report anyway.

I knew it before the post. I use opera on
yahoo from where I work. Yahoo truncates
lines very shortly, opera cannot send
attachments with this web interface, and I
cannot reliably use other browsers because
of crappy anti-viruses (websweeper...). It
really is a hell on earth, but so ridiculous
that I prefer to laught at it now. I wish I
had a true SMTP access to send standard
posts, believe me !

Willy
