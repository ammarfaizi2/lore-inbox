I have a need for a headless machine to power off at the end of shutdown,
but cannot get it to work for smp kernels. I tried 2.2.14, and 2.4.9,
built with smp and apm. If there is a way to make this work, I would
really appreciate any advice. If it cannot be done I would sure like to
know that too, so I can stop banging my head on this particular wall.
Please send responses to me directly as I am not on this list. TIA.

Cheers,
Shawn
