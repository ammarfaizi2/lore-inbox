Fair comment. I can happily put it on a web site with a pointer instead
any preferences to a location like kernel.org or just 'wherever'

Splitting it up by company is easy enough to do - split the web page
into "Interested in contracts below $1000, $10000, $100000, $1M, ..."
sections

One could construct a verifiable non-repuditable rating scheme I guess.
That depends if its worth it

	"People who paid for bug fixes in the 3c501 driver also bought
	 MacIIfx support contracts..."
