>hrm.  In that case I'll shut up with the speculating.

Please dont stop speculating. I and many others rely on someone like yourself 
who is more likely to understand what is going on to comment. I can't expect 
you to know exactly what goes into every patchset out there. Your input has 
been invaluable and most of the drive for my benchmarking.

Sounds fair enough. My resources are exhausted though. Someone else have any 
thoughts?
