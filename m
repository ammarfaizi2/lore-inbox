Subject: kswapd problems with 2.4.{9,10}
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0110051119070.19656-100000@tide.corp.google.com>

I've run into what I think is a problem with linux 2.4.{9,10} and a
memory intensive application we use here. The application works by
readonly mmapping large chunks of disk into memory and then mlocking
them into place. As the application runs, it replaces old chunks
mapped in with new chunks that it wants to map, after unlocking the
old chunks. The problem occurs after the program runs for a
while. kswapd starts going crazy, consuming all of one CPU's
cycles. If I quit my application and restart it, kswapd goes crazy
immediately. The machine behaves this way until I reboot (it never
recovers). This application works without problems on 2.2.19.

For example, I have a machine with 2G of RAM, 2 1Ghz PIII's, no swap,
and a stock linux 2.4.9 kernel. My application mmaps two 407M chunks
of memory into RAM, and then mlocks them to force them to load from
disk. After accessing the first chunk for a while, it unlocks the
first chunk, un-maps it, and then loads a new file in its place,
mmaping and mlocking the new file. After loading some number (around
5) of these chunks (only 2 at a time), kswapd starts consuming 100% of
one CPU, and the mmapping and mlocking of new chunks slows down
significantly. If I let the program continue running, the machine
eventually hangs. I've tried 2.4.10 and it behaves much worse, locking
the machine up sooner.

I've created a simple test program that reproduces this
behavior. WARNING, this program will slowly make your machine
unusable. It needs to be run as root to be able to mlock memory. The
test program needs blocks of data on disk to mmap -- the following
shell command will create sample blocks:

bash# for i in `seq 0 19`; do dd if=/dev/zero of=/export/hda3/tmp/chunk$i count=6682555 bs=64; done

I've attached the test program at the bottom of this message, as well
as the kernel config I've used to build my kernel. Please contact me
if you have further questions.
