Two paths you might want to cover are netfilter and IPsec.  Both of these
can be tested by simply adding netfilter rules and IPsec policies/SAs and
then running the same test you were using before.

You might also want to look at multicast but I don't know of any good
tests for that.

Oh and then there are VLANs, bridging, Ethernet bonding, qdisc's, etc.
Again these can be tested by setting up the relevant devices or rules
and running the usual TCP/UDP tests.

Cheers,
