USB and SCSI are both enabled/disabled in the system buses menu.  The
apparent confusion happens because of their defaults.

Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best
state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one;
for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries *by a
government*, which we might expect in a country *without government*,
our calamities is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means
by which we suffer."
	-- Thomas Paine
