It makes no sense to comment things if you don't know what's going on.
So please avoid comments like this in the future.

Your statement "it may be now moved to non-free in Debian in the near future"
is just complete nonsense. Of course, I am in discussions with Debian people 
about the best method to force SuSE not to publish broken versions of cdrtools 
in the future.

Let me comment what SuSE is currently doing with cdrtools:

A program is an artwork (this is what the European Union did write into laws).

Even though you may get the permission to modify an artwork, you will not get 
the permission to create bad carricatures and call them just "modified 
versions".

The GPL requires you not to impact the original authors' reputations, but this 
is what SuSE is doing by publishing defective variants.
