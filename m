OK,

I ctags -R the source tree, getting a 28meg tag file, and searched it in 
emacs.

Sheeshhsh...  I've got a dotcom network to admin., php/postgres/ssh apps to 
develop, and all the business crap needed to "run" a business to deal with.  
(you know, all that gov crap that's got nothing to do with making YOUR OWN 
living.)

Basically I want to use this laptop as a proof of concept demo to all the 
un-free masses out there who think linux is bad cause (Apple using) Rush 
Limbaugh sez so.  But a laptop with NO power management and NO sound is the 
proof of concept the Evil people would like me to show.


This sucks.

John, thanks for the ctags tip.  It helped now, and will even more in the 
future.  

Dave

PS -- I'm damned tired of manufactures NOT supporting us.  Are we a market or 
not?
