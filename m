Try leaving the ivory towers of academics for the real world.
I did and it was a rude slap in the face.  Most academics don't get the
real world of business, they can teach it but generally can not do it.
If they could do it, they would not be in academics.  Except for the few
cases of people who just get off on teaching and that is wonderful.
Maybe you are different, and do not fit under the brush.  However your
comments about NDA's leaves me little faith in your knowledge base.
