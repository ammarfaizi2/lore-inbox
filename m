The vendors will just lie like they do now.  For example M-Audio claims
all its products are supported under Linux but leave out the fact that
half of it had to be reverse engineered, lots of it still doesn't work
right for lack of docs, and whenever someone asks them about Linux
support they just punt to the ALSA mailing lists.
