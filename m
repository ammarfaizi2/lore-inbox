actually I think that your case for ignoring the 'no reverse engineering'
would be far better if you paid for a bitkeeper license, but when you are
being allowed to use it for free on the condition that you use it specific
ways (no reverse engineering and public access to changeset info) saying
that you will eliminate complying with those terms but still get to use it
for free isn't being very reasonable.
