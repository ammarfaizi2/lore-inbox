Hi everybody!

I've got a problem with a machine (using an Asus SP98AGP-X mainboard) that 
doesn't want to power off since moving from 2.2.x to 2.4.x kernel. As I 
haven't found any other solution, can I simply replace the new apm.c by the 
old one from 2.2.x or just a part of the unit or would that be fatal?

PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS!

Thanks in advance,

Christian Schoenebeck
