Both filename lines should begin one level above "drivers/".
They can be named linux* or a/ and b/ or foo/ and bar/ or whatever.
The patch needs to apply using "patch -p1".

This is all well-documented.  Please review:

linux-2.6.current/Documentation/SubmittingPatches
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html

and let us know if anything there needs to be clarified.
