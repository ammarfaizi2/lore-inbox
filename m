NP, will do.

I might as well take this opportunity to comment on my own sight.

Apparently, someone was quick to take advantage of a recently announced
exploit and defaced www2.randomlogic.com (as I'm sure some of you have
noticed). The exploit has been fixed, of course, but they were a little
faster than the server owner (hey, it happens occasionally :), that
owner not being me.

Apparently, either they don't like Linux, or maybe they thought they had
to prove a point because of my sig. Whatever, who cares.

Anyway, I'll fix it soon enough.
