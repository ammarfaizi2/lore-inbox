Hi ,

  Is there a way by which we can trace the flow of 
execution of a process , when it is executing the 
kernel code path ?

  Any tool which does this would help understand 
which all functions / code path is taken in the kernel
when a particular program executes .

  strace provides just the system call invocation ,
but I would like to know what happens within the 
kernel when the system call executes .

  Kindly reply directly to me as I'am not subscribed
 to the list .

Cheers !
