There seems to be a lot of confusion surrounding ppp and pppoe these days.

In June someone inquired about the Ostrowski's pppoe patch for pppd and was
pointed to the ppp cvs archive at samba. However it seems the cvs archive
there only has a roaring-penguin pppoe module, not the native kernel
implementation.

What happened to the cleaner kernel implementation that didn't require extra
user-space packet filters?

Also, is there a mailing list for the ppp development? It seems to be kind of
an orphan on samba's servers with no status or news pages on their web site
and no mailing list for bug reports, or development discussion.
