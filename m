My experience with NVidia drivers has
been all good -

However ATI is hopeful, we need some
competition. I found that a radeon worked
well, in terms of 3D screensavers, and
quake 3 arena - however starting RtCW
resulted in immediate hard lockup, every
time - no ping, no sysrq.

People are working on ATI drivers, who
knows, maybe there will be something
usable soon.
