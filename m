   I have been having a devil of a time trying to get SMP to work with
stability on the new B2 stepping of the 760 MPX chipset (Tyan 2466N-4M
motherboard).  Has anyone fiddled with it, and if so, are there any known
bugs?  My gut feeling is that the BIOS included with the motherboard is
incredibly buggy, but I haven't been able to find any information to
confirm or contradict that.
