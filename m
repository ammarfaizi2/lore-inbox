Maybe you should read the e-mails a bit more carefully.  The issue
you're refering to is NOT renaming the kernel, but rather what people
believe the collection of kernel, libraries, and user-land tools should
properly be called.  I don't think I've ever seen RMS (or anyone else
for that matter) say that the kernel itself should be called anything
other than Linux.  The controversy is what peoples' ideas of what
constitutes the operating system are and what to call it.
