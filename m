Jeff, you are WAY off in left field.  The GPL is fundamentally different
from any other software license.  The so-called license that comes with
Windows seeks to limit the rights of the Windows buyer.  It limits your
right to fair use, criticism, and so forth.  The GPL is different
because it actually grants you rights you would not have other wise had:
the right to redistribute the software product.

UCITA seeks to make Microsoft's license -- which cannot be a contract
because it provides no benefit for the software user and no obligation
for the software maker -- enforceable as a contract.  Again the GPL is
fundamentally different because people assent to its terms for their own
benefit.  Microsoft's license provides no benefit and no person would
ever agree to it, nor do they need to: their rights are secured as the
buyer of goods[1] and they can throw the license in the recycling pile.

software publishers. However, this preference does not alter the Court's
analysis that the substance of the transaction at issue here is a sale
and not a license."  Judge Dean D. Pregerson, United States District
Court for the Central District of California.
