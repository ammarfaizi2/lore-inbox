hello,

after upgrading my computer to newer distro with kernel series 2.4 ive found
something i have question about
issuing free or top commands shows 0kb of shared memory

how is that possible ?
i have apache and mysql running, thought they'd use shared memory?

i recompiled procps package with no effect

can someone please xplain it to me ?

thanx in advance,
terry
