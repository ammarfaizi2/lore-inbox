My proposal to block mail composed with Outlook was half serious but I
believe that the reason behind this half serious side is that it educates
users.

I don't care when I receive a virus. But It means that somebody lurking
lkml has most likely launch an unknown attachment. 
And this is the main way viruses are propagated. Only a small number of
viruses use Outlook giant security hole that allows to execute an
attachment without user action (other that viewing the mail). Sircam like
ILoveYou&co need help from stupid (uneducated) user.

So if you forbid Outlook and explain why, people becomes more aware of this
problem.
And this is important, specially important on this RED CODE day where even
Microsoft advices its NT users to shutdown their machine. I would not be
astonished to have Internet problem today due to the wasted bandwidth.
