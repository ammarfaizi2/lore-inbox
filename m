I can report that mode 4 is not at all well here.  I turned it on and 
changed the extraversion, built it, and when it booted, it got to 
this line and hung:

Checking to see if this processor honours the WP bit even in 
supervisor mode... OK.

And I had to use the hardware reset to recover & boot to a mode 3 
version of 50-06.

That .config is attached.
