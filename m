One of the links between my fingers and the list is 2.0.33, but I would
not install anything but 2.4 on a new install. I get uptimes in the 200+
day range with 2.4 and far better performance and networking.

Note that I agree on what's most stable, but if the question is what
should I install, 2.4.xx is the choice. 2.4.13-ac was very stable, but I'm
sure 2.4.17-ac2 will be as well. Alan actually runs his kernels, so they
will compile and run.
