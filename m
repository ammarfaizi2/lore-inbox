You're not *listening*: only the encoding of the gif is encumbered by patents. 
The "decoding" of the gif is *not*.

So only the original author of the gif had to worry about using a software that 
had a license to generate GIF's (like photoshop, etc.). To use/decode the GIF 
there are no restrictions. AFAIK, there are absolutely no patent infrigments in 
distributing the logo.gif file.

Now that I've said this, I must say that I would also prefer a completely 
open-source format like PNG to be used :)
