Again, Ill clarify my possition, I didnt mean to slam on Linus, but its too big
for him to maintain AND code for. As much as I would like him to maintain it, 
he is a human, like us. Well, most of us. Im still wondering about ac. ;) 

And he still is technically maintainer for the 2.5 kernel because he hasnt officially named anyone else. And no, im not saying 2.5 is in maintence mode, but you have to maintain code already written to improve it. Recoding falls under maintance, belive it or not.

And yes, I think Linus is cool for letting all of us use the kernel and hack the kernel and all the other geek goodness. And dont take this as Im slamming the kernel either. But I mean, we need more dedicated kernels coder. Linus just happens to be (imho) the best kernel coder we have.
