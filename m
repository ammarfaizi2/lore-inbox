Yes, IBM is definately behind OSS, but that doesn't mean everything is suddenly
opened...and for many people, it's still got to have a 'business' (or legal)
reason to be made open (apart from the technical benefits of OSS)...

IBM is one of the biggest companies around, and obviously everyone can't do a
mental 180 in a short period of time...;-)

Although I just got here a year ago, so I don't really know what it was like in
the 'old days' :)

I actually think that in this case (and possibly many others) it's not a case
of wanting to 'protect' amazing code or design, but more that people are used to
working a certain way (closed), and it's hard to change.  They still have a
'reflex' that tells them to keep it closed, and need a good business (or legal)
reason to open it...instead of asking 'why not?' they ask 'why?'.

In this specific case, the obvious benefits like peer review, increased user and
developer base, etc. were ignored; they thought the user and/or developer base
(any retail company or ISV) was too specific and/or small.
