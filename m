Greetings;

The old fart is back again. :)

I've just done a divide and conquer on kernel versions, and have found that 
while I DO have a kde audio signon for kernels 2.6.18-rc1-rc3-rc4, I do 
not have any other functioning audio, including the kde sound effects I 
normally get.  xmms and tvtime are mute, as are the firefox plugins to 
play videos from the network. 2.6.17.8 and below works great yet.

So whats the fix?

-- 
Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
