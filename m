Balderdash! It is like selling a car with free professional
maintenance, but no manuals to allow you to repair your own car. :-)

It might be true that nVidia is actually limiting their market. Since
that results in loss of money to nVidia, and not to you, it really isn't
any of our call. If they are not yet comfortable with the GPL, then that
is the way it is. _I'm_ not comfortable with the GPL -- although that is
mostly Richard Stallman's fault, as I liked the GPL before he opened his
mouth...
