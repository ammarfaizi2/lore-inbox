Thank you. I think that completely clarified your position in this.

Personally, I'm more of a "crusader". I don't think it's ok to force
someone into our way of thinking, but when the try to use our work I
feel they have at least a moral obligation to be as open themselves.
Kind of along the lines of the old "Do unto others..."-saying. That also
mean I don't really like bundling proprietary and open software (which I
do for a living so feel free to call me a hypocrite).

This whole DRM:d hardware issue is a bit different though since it seems
to be moving to a point where it cannot be avoided. "Vote with your
wallet" fails when there are so few of us that care about these things.
With they way electronics are packaged nowadays (chip packages that is),
it's getting increasingly difficult to build your own stuff. My fear is
that open source will be something you can only fiddle with on your ten
year old computer from the pre-DRM era.
