Well, that's often what it takes, I'm afraid ... going direct to Linus is
by no means the only way to work, and it's often not the easiest. Try 
picking someone who's interested in the area you're working on, if possible
(ideally the maintainer if you can work out who it is). Failing that, try 
Andrew or Alan or both.

It's a bit like Darwinian evolution, or Democracy ... both rather horribly
inefficient, but overall it's reasonably effective. Yeah, it's crap
sometimes. Sorry.
