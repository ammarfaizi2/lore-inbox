I agree with this line of thinking.  The various academics studying
geology have been warning California about "The Big One" for years now,
and no one seems to care anymore.  

I don't think anyone's being lazy and I certainly don't have the

assume they were working very hard on other things (like getting TPC-H
benchmarks to run!)
