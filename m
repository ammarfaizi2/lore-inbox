anyone who wants to can setup a bitkeeper server, set it to sync with
bkbits.net every 5 min and re-export the data (including the SCCS
formatted metadata) any way they want. Larry has even encouraged people to
do this.

what he is refusing to do is to pay the cash for the bandwith to support
this.

I'll volunteer to run such a server so that you purists don't have to get
your hands dirty by touching bitkeeper, as long as someone else is paying
the bandwidth and hosting costs (and I'm not requiring a colo facility,
someone's house with appropriate bandwidth is good enough for me. I'm
willing to cut any corners that can be cut to keep it cheap)
