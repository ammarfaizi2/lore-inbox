Ok - I had a bad day today struggling with hardware. Having said that 
I'm somewhat frustrated with the lack of progress of Linux getting it 
right with Asus, nVidia, and AMD processors right.

I still have to run pci=nommconf to keep the server from locking up. 
That's with both 939 pin and AM2 motherboards.

This bug remains unresolved:

So what's up with the no progress?
