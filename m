This patch, in conjunction with the "core" high-res-timers
patch implements high resolution timers on the i386
platforms.  The high-res-timers use the periodic interrupt
to "remind" the system to look at the clock.  The clock
should be relatively high resolution (1 micro second or
better).  This patch allows configuring of three possible
clocks, the TSC, the ACPI pm timer, or the Programmable
interrupt timer (PIT).  Most of the changes in this patch
are in the arch/i386/kernel/timer/* code.

This patch uses (if available) the APIC timer(s) to generate
1/HZ ticks and sub 1/HZ ticks as needed.  The PIT still
interrupts, but if the APIC timer is available, just causes
the wall clock update.  No attempt is made to make this
interrupt happen on jiffie boundaries, however, the APIC
timers are disciplined to expire on 1/HZ boundaries to give
consistent timer latencies WRT to the system time.

With this patch applied and enabled (at config time in the
processor feature section), the system clock will be the
specified clock.  The PIT is not used to keep track of time,
but only to remind the system to look at the clock.  Sub
jiffies are kept and available for code that knows how to
use them.

Depends on the core high res timers patch.

Patch is against 2.5.44-bk3

This patch as well as the POSIX clocks & timers patch is
available on the project site:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/

The 3 parts to the high res timers are:
 core		The core kernel (i.e. platform independent) changes
*i386		The high-res changes for the i386 (x86) platform
 posixhr	The changes to the POSIX clocks & timers patch to
use high-res timers

Please apply.

+High-res-timers
+CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS
+  POSIX timers are available by default.  This option enables high
+  resolution POSIX timers.  With this option the resolution is at
+  least 1 micro second.  High resolution is not free.  If enabled this
+  option will add a small overhead each time a timer expires that is
+  not on a 1/HZ tick boundry.  If no such timers are used the overhead
+  is nil.
+
+  This option enables two additional POSIX CLOCKS, CLOCK_REALTIME_HR
+  and CLOCK_MONOTONIC_HR.  Note that this option does not change the
+  resolution of CLOCK_REALTIME or CLOCK_MONOTONIC which remain at 1/HZ
+  resolution.
+
+High-res-timers clock
+CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMER_ACPI_PM 
+  This option allows you to choose the wall clock timer for your system.
+  With high resolution timers on the x86 platforms it is best to keep
+  the interrupt generating timer separate from the time keeping timer.
+  On x86 platforms there are three possible sources implemented for the
+  wall clock.  These are:
+ 
+  <timer>				<resolution>
+  ACPI power management (pm) timer	~280 nano seconds
+  TSC (Time Stamp Counter)		1/CPU clock
+  PIT (Programmable Interrupt Timer)	~838 nano seconds
+
+  The PIT is used to generate interrupts and at any given time will be
+  programmed to interrupt when the next timer is to expire or on the
+  next 1/HZ tick.  For this reason it is best to not use this timer as
+  the wall clock timer.  This timer has a resolution of 838 nano
+  seconds.  THIS OPTION SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF BOTH ACPI AND TSC ARE
+  NOT AVAILABLE.
+
+  The TSC runs at the cpu clock rate (i.e. its resolution is 1/CPU
+  clock) and it has a very low access time.  However, it is subject,
+  in some (incorrect) processors, to throttling to cool the cpu, and
+  to other slow downs during power management.  If your cpu is correct
+  and does not change the TSC frequency for throttling or power
+  management this is the best clock timer.
+
+  The ACPI pm timer is available on systems with Advanced Configuration
+  and Power Interface support.  The pm timer is available on these
+  systems even if you don't use or enable ACPI in the software or the
+  BIOS (but see Default ACPI pm timer address).  The timer has a
+  resolution of about 280 nanoseconds, however, the access time is a bit
+  higher that that of the TSC.  Since it is part of ACPI it is intended
+  to keep track of time while the system is under power management, thus
+  it is not subject to the problems of the TSC.
+
+  If you enable the ACPI pm timer and it can not be found, it is
+  possible that your BIOS is not producing the ACPI table or that your
+  machine does not support ACPI.  In the former case, see "Default ACPI
+  pm timer address".  If the timer is not found the boot will fail when
+  trying to calibrate the delay timer.
+
+Default ACPI pm timer address
+CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMER_ACPI_PM_ADD
+  This option is available for use on systems where the BIOS does not
+  generate the ACPI tables if ACPI is not enabled.  For example some
+  BIOSes will not generate the ACPI tables if APM is enabled.  The ACPI
+  pm timer is still available but can not be found by the software.
+  This option allows you to supply the needed address.  When the high
+  resolution timers code finds a valid ACPI pm timer address it reports
+  it in the boot messages log (look for lines that begin with
+  "High-res-timers:").  You can turn on the ACPI support in the BIOS,
+  boot the system and find this value.  You can then enter it at
+  configure time.  Both the report and the entry are in decimal.

+
+ * In theory you could turn this off, but it has been so long....
+
+ * There are two reasons to keep this:
+ * 1. The NMI watchdog uses the timer interrupt to generate the NMI interrupts.
+ * 2. We don't have to touch the PIT unless we have a sub jiffie event in
+ *    the next 1/HZ interval (unless we drift away from the 1/HZ boundry).

+ * The high-res-timers option is set up to self configure with different 
+ * platforms.  It is up to the platform to provide certian macros which
+ * override the default macros defined in system without (or with disabled)
+ * high-res-timers.
+ *
+ * To do high-res-timers at some fundamental level the timer interrupt must
+ * be seperated from the time keeping tick.  A tick can still be generated
+ * by the timer interrupt, but it may be surrounded by non-tick interrupts.
+ * It is up to the platform to determine if a particular interrupt is a tick,
+ * and up to the timer code (in timer.c) to determine what time events have
+ * expired.
+ *
+ * Macros:
+ * update_jiffies()  This macro is to compute the new value of jiffie and 
+ *                   sub_jiffie.  If high-res-timers are not available it
+ *                   may be assumed that this macro will be called once
+ *                   every 1/HZ and so should reduce to:
+ *
+ * 	(*(u64 *)&jiffies_64)++;
+ *
+ * sub_jiffie, in this case will always be zero, and need not be addressed.
+ * It is assumed that the sub_jiffie is in platform defined units and runs
+ * from 0 to a value which represents 1/HZ on that platform.  (See conversion
+ * macro requirements below.)
+ * If high-res-timers are available, this macro will be called each timer
+ * interrupt which may be more often than 1/HZ.  It is up to the code to 
+ * determine if a new jiffie has just started and pass this info to:
+ *
+ * new_jiffie() which should return true if the last call to update_jiffie()
+ *              moved the jiffie count (as apposed to just the sub_jiffie).
+ *              For systems without high-res-timers the kernel will predefine
+ *              this to be 0 which will allow the compiler to optimize the code
+ *              for this case.  In SMP systems this should be set to all 1's
+ *              as it is used in a per cpu fashion to indicate that a paricular
+ *              cpu needs to run the accounting code.  It should result
+ *              in a variable that can be cast to a volital long and of
+ *              which the address can be taken.
+ *
+ * schedule_next_int(jiffie_f,sub_jiffie_v,always) is a macro that the 
+ *                                 platform should 
+ *                                 provide that will set up the timer interrupt 
+ *                                 hardware to interrupt at the absolute time
+ *                                 defined by jiffie_f,sub_jiffie_v where the 
+ *                                 units are 1/HZ and the platform defined 
+ *                                 sub_jiffie unit.  This function must 
+ *                                 determine the actual current time and the 
+ *                                 requested offset and act accordingly.  A 
+ *                                 sub_jiffie_v value of -1 should be 
+ *                                 understood to mean the next even jiffie 
+ *                                 regardless of the jiffie_f value.  If 
+ *                                 the current jiffie is not jiffie_f, it 
+ *                                 may be assumed that the requested time 
+ *                                 has passed and an immeadiate interrupt 
+ *                                 should be taken.  If high-res-timers are 
+ *                                 not available, this macro should evaluate 
+ *                                 to nil.  This macro may return 1 if always
+ *                                 if false AND the requested time has passed.
+ *                                 "Always" indicates that an interrupt is

+         * the correction.  (Note that drift that makes the value  
+         * smaller is the easy one.)  We also require that
