Oh, no, no, no, no... my productivity!

I love it.  :)  My interest in #kernelnewbies has certainly been
tweaked.

So what method did you use to get your list of kernel symbols?  (i.e. is
it arch specific as System.map or do you have a way of pulling all
archs?)

Now, can you make a version to guess the values of various #defines?  Or
perhaps given the definition, guess the #define.  ;)  Twisted
individual... and I mean that in the best possible way... ;)
