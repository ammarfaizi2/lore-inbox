OK, suit yourself.

Anyway, there was no need to get so defensive - Arjan was just telling
you that it's not up to the kernel developers when reiser4 gets in, it's
up the the reiser4 developers when they submit it in a mergeable state
(they know what that is), so you should ask the reiser4 people when they
plan to do that.
