it does not matter that it's a bold faced lie, people technically 'lie' 
about little things all the time and for a good reason - the human 
species (especially males) are way to agressive by default, so a certain 
conscious buffer zone is needed to even that out. (It is in fact a 
medical condition if that buffer-zone does not exist.)

But there's a crutial difference. A statement from Linus (or you) like 
the one above also shows three more things that are important:

1) that you have a sense of humor, and that you dont take things too
   seriously :) Humor goes a long way defusing differences.

2) that you actually entertain the possibility of being wrong and that
   you do not just want to steamroll the other side with your opinion.

3) that you actually care about the other person. This matters alot.
   There's a reason why hundreds of people who never met each other join
   on a mailing list and write code, and the reason is definitely not to
   have others piss on their code.

i took some time and re-read your thread with Roman about cpusets back 
in September. It was like fresh air! Roman was totally reasonable and 
positive in that thread - so i dont think it's me or Thomas misreading 
his style in this case or something.

anyway, the reason i confronted Roman with the situation was in the 
renewed hope to improve direct communication. I'm still hopeful :)
