Kernel was patched with the hpt-patch which was posted to linux-kernel about a
week ago. LVM is used, ext3 on all filesystems. The system was still running
but with one D-state process.

lspci -v, part of /proc/cpuinfo and kernel config included after the oops.

Linux version 2.4.12-ac6-hpt (root@zeus) (gcc version 2.95.4 20011006
(Debian prerelease)) #1 Thu Oct 25 10:31:58 EEST 2001

ksymoops 2.4.1 on i686 2.4.12-ac6-hpt.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.12-ac6-hpt/ (default)
     -m /boot/System.map-2.4.12-ac6-hpt (default)

Warning: You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will
assume that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running
right now and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.

No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
Warning (read_lsmod): no symbols in lsmod, is /proc/modules a valid lsmod file?
Warning (compare_maps): mismatch on symbol partition_name  , ksyms_base says c01ca6b0, System.map says c014fde0.  Ignoring ksyms_base entry
