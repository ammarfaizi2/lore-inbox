I just created a mailing list for this discussion attached to one of my 
existing sourceforge projects.  It's penguicon-comphist@lists.sourceforge.net.

This is sort of an abuse of sourceforge, but then again the project I 
attached it to is to put together a Linux convention in Austin in 2003 and 
we'll probably have at least one panel on computer history, and most likely a 
BOF too, so it's SORT of on topic. :)

To subscribe, apparently you go here:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/penguicon-comphist

(I've cc'd the people who've emailed me about this topic so far, but haven't 
subscribed anybody.  If you're interested, you have to do it yourself.)
