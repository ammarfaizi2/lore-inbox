Cort has put in an enormous amount of time and effort into maintaining
the PowerPC port of Linux over the past 5 or 6 years, and I for one
would like to acknowledge that publicly and thank him for that.  It
has not always been an easy task, I know, because there are a wide
range of opinions within the PPC/Linux camp and Cort has been the man
on the spot to sort out the balance between the competing interests.
And I for one will miss the time, effort and resources he has put into
the infrastructure things such as the repository, web pages, ftp site
etc.

I would also like to thank FSM Labs for contributing the space and
bandwidth for the PPC/Linux repository over the last couple of years.

Paul.
