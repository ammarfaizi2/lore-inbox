One of the big problems in C99 was that there was nobody on the committee  
who really understood gcc well, so the committee had problems using gcc  
solutions given that nobody would be able to really describe them.

And the reason no such expert was there was that the FSF didn't send  
anyone, because they seem to think standards tend to ignore what they want  
to do.

It's a classic vicious circle.
