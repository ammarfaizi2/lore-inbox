I saw a report on AMDZone of another VIA chipset bug.  The original source
is:-
http://www.chip.de/news_stories/news_stories_163106.html

The claim from AMDZone's translation is that:-
" According to the report KT133A boards with chipset codes of 1EA0 and
1EA4 can have the bug which causes your computer to restart."

Has this one bitten Linuxers yet?
