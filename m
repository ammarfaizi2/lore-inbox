Something is not quite right here.  I built rc2-mm3 and booted (uni processor, amd64, preempt on).  
mm3 lasted about 30 mins before locking up with a dead keyboard.  I had mm2 reboot a few times
over the last couple of days too.  

11-mm3 uptime of 2 weeks+
12-rc2-mm2 reboots once every couple of days
12-rc2-mm3 locked up within 30 mins using X using kmail/bogofilter

My serial console does not seem to want to work.  Has anything changed with this support?

TIA,
Ed Tomlinson
