The only windows system that I have seen that was reliable (unless the 
people there were lying to me) was a big ibm netfinity system.  I 
believe it was stable because it didn't use any extra harware or drivers 
except what ibm had installed on the box.

What I'm saying is that most of the problems with windows are from 
flakey, half-baked drivers and dll's form third parties.  I've got no 
hard numbers, just my personal experiences.

Binary onlyt drivers are bad.  Source drivers are good.  THat's just the 
way it is.
