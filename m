Don't they understand that Linux is actually a system that is growing to
be very popular?

And I would think they would want to support new things with TCP, with a
router and all.  If something is reserved, I would read that to be
reserved, not denied.  Interesting thing - Why would they go out of their
way to deny a few packets if they eventually make use of a few bits?

Eventually, Microsoft will start conforming, I would think, and when that
happens just *watch* everybody follow.
