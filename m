Andre Margis --

I saw your name in a usenet group and have several questions about EMC. I am
writing a story for Network World and would appreciate your responses.

On Monday EMC is announcing a new storage management platform that will
ultimately be able to manage other storage and Fibre Channel devices than
Symmetrix' and Celerra. It will be able to monitor and manage HP XP256/512,
IBM Sharks, any Compaq StorageWorks array, Hitachi Freedom and Sun StorEdge.
They will also ship a middleware layer that will let users and ISVs link
their software to the EMC platform.

1. Do you have other storage than EMC? If so what?
2. Is it important that you be able to manage and monitor that storage from
the same management interface? Why?
3. Are you cutting back on IT spending?
4. Would you possibly develop applications that you would want to tie to
this EMC management product?
5. What storage management packages do you have?
6. Is it important that they be able to be integrated into the EMC offering?
7. What is your title? Who do you work for? Where are they located?

Thanking you in advance for your answers.
