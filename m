So what did you want for Christmas this year :-?

Maybe I should stop now because I have history of being able to "irritate
you mightily" !!!

You know me from our conversions offline and in person, and enough said
there.  There are times when I am a classic BOHA and other when I a
serious and cold.  You know my intent, and that is all that needs to be
said.

What I really want, is a better License for all.

Cheers,
