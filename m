    Ok, this may seem pathetic... but I'd like to start fixing my own 
bugs in the kernel as I find them, but as my education thus far has been 
coding and not *nix related, I do not know how to create a diff to 
submit in the correct format for inclusion in the kernel, any help, or 
suggestions where to get help or any such?  TIA
