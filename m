Looking forward!

Swsusp for 2.4 is nearing 1.0.

Swsusp activities have moved to sourceforge as Florent's pages are no longer 
updated and he also took leave of absence. Florent also mentioned in one of 
his last posts that the old swsusp mailing list at fornax may evaporate any 
time. 

Could we please use the new mailing list <swsusp-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
as well as the download area there (link below)?

Regards
Michael
