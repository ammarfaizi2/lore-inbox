They have at least a few boards that don't need the flash util, you just
alt-f2 when it's booting, and it loads it off the floppy.  I've got an
ASUS P4B533 that i just flashed to a beta 1012, futilely searching for a
fix for the fact that my machine will not boot Win98 unless it is in
logged mode.  Safe mode works, but regular boot will not, only if you do
option 2 in the startup menu.  Had to hunt down a disk to recycle to use.

Speaking of floppies, old wisdom said to always flash off the floppy, then
it was always flash off the hd, and now it's back to flashing off the floppy?

I wonder what you do for floppyless computers.
