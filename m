The problem is that they could very easily drop support for linux, then 
what do we do?
We don't have any form of access to the top-of-the-line hardware needed 
to run most new games, which means there'll be less incentive to try and 
port them, so there's less reason to create drivers, ad infintum...

If anything the only thing we can really do is ask *politely* if they 
could open more of the drivers...
