Argh, no, don't do this.  The Subarchitecture specific code should never
appear in the standard include directory (that was about the whole
point).  The extern for hard_smp_processor_id should just be global,
since it's common to all architectures, and the voyager specific define
should be in a voyager specific header file.

As an aside, it shows the problems x86 got itself into with it's
inconsistent direction of physical vs logical CPUs.  The idea was that
smp_processor_id() and hard_smp_processor_id() were supposed to return
the same thing, only hard_... went to the actual SMP registers to get
it.
