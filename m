RTLinux has never had code in the kernel, but it still had
a mention in the maintainers file for quite a number of years.
I think that these entries are really pointers for those who
are interested in this area of Linux's use. As such, RTAI is
the only real free software real-time Linux extension and I
think it deserves mention. Nowadays, rtlinux.org is only an
alias for fsmlabs.com, which I think pretty much sums up the
situation.
