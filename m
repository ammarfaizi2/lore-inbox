Good day,
I have to first of all apologise for taking you unawares by 
the contents of this message.  I had to send the message 
straightaway because of the short time involved in what 
I demand of you.  Please treat this message with utmost 
seriousness and swiftness.  
Apart from the fact that you will be adequately rewarded, 
I will forever show my gratitude.
I am Mr. Aroujo Tao Savimbi, son of the late Angolan Leader 
Jonas Savimbi who was killed last year.  I got your contact 
details from the internet because I really have no time and 
I needed an anonymous person abroad whom I hope I can trust.  
I pray I am not making wrong judgement by coming to you.
Jonas Savimbi deposited a large sum of money with a security 
vault in Europe that is my late fathe. The movement of members 
of his family (including me) is restricted.  Our movement are 
monitored but I have managed to enter South Africa where I 
intend to lie very low until I complete this transaction with 
you.  Other members of my family and I do not have access to 
any of these deposits with banks in Angola and Europe so you 
can see how desperately we need your assistance.
Both government officials and fraudulent relatives are trying 
to get their hands on my father=92s wealth by claiming that the 
wealth was gotten through arms smuggling and illegal sale of 
diamonds.
You can find out more about my late father by checking this 
profile at URL below:
www.kwacha.com/edoc2.htm
His wealth is estimated to be over US$1billion and my mother, 
being the only one with some of the documents has aided me to 
sneak into South Africa refugee Camp and conclude this 
transaction with any one I choose.
I have spoken with the security company and the operations 
manager has agreed to release the two trunk boxes in their 
possession to whomever=92s name I issue a power of attorney 
as the new beneficiary of the deposit. This security company 
has US$50,000,000.00 each and precious materials which my 
father lodged in their safe keep in  America before his death 
so I will give you their contact and relevant documents 
including power of attorney to allow you access to the 
two trunk boxes of money.
The whole idea is for you to receive this money physically, 
set up bank accounts in  America and transfer in bits into 
your home bank accounts before my government even knows 
what is happening.  My father was a rebel leader in Angola 
before his death.  You must follow my instructions as stated 
above the transfer of the funds because it will be difficult 
for the Angolan government to trace my father=92s money to an 
individuals account moreso, when you have no prior relationship 
with us.
I am currently and temporarily living in South Africa refugee 
camp and I will be communicating with you on a satellite phone 
and GSM to avoid intervention by the authorities.
We have to keep this transaction very secret because of the 
political situation in Angola at the moment.  I shall send 
you a password and information that will include power of 
attorney and the contact of the security company as soon as 
you are ready to proceed.
Could you please send your full names, address, confidential 
telephone and fax number to enable me issue a power of attorney 
to you and refer you to the security company in Atlanta Geoger U.S.A for 
immediate payment.
Please reply to my confidential e-mail assistsavimbi@netscape.net
Yours sincerely,
Aroujo Tao Saimbi
