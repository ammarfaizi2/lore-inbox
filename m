A metal case with a small circuit board, and some magnetic splattered
(very precisly) on a disk doesn't seem like as much work as trying to
fit over 10^12 transistors onto dies fitting in the same space.  Making
waffers for memory isn't free, and higher densities take work to
develop.  I am not sure what the current density for ram if in terms of
bits per area.  I am sure it is a lot less than what a harddisk managed
with magnetic material.  I am amazed either one works.

We will see. :)
