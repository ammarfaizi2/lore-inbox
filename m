Adam,

This was just dropped in my lap.

---------------------------
Add IBM to this list with their QDIO drivers for OSA-Express on s390(x).

On S/390, IBM did the same as Andre. LCS drivers have been binary-only in
the beginning and have been released under GPL later after 3172 and other
LCS devices became obsoleted by IBM. QDIO is their current standard and
they don't want to open this channel protocol to their competition.

So i think, there is enough precedence even from the "big guys".
---------------------------

Now that you have clearly stated you are revoking usage of your work
except for GPL-ONLY.

Please list the files and functions you claim, under this decision.
If you are the sole copyright holder of a file it is clean and clear.
If you are not then you have a problem to settle with the joint owners.
I will ignore your claim on shared copyrights until you have a settlement,
if all persons holding copyright ownership agree with you then ...

How soon will there be a patch-war for everyone to stake a claim, and
screw the pooch ?

Cheers,
