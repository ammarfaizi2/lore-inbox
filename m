Why is it that after I successfully compile qt3 and kde3.0.x... that I can
never go back and
recompile the beast without kde's ./configure scripts not being able to
find qt3?? it acts like a
onetime shot at compiling and then never again. 

It's a pain in the ass. What's the skinny, if any one knows?
