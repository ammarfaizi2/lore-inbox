Dear Sir,
            	Investment Assistance
 I humbly approach you with a view that we may be able to enter into a mutual =
business transaction that could be of immense benefit to both parties. =
Foremost, I should begin by introducing myself.

 I am   Mr. Azziz   Bashir the son of late Mr.  Gaetiano Bashir, a precious =
stone merchant in Sierra Leone, who died in the year 6th of May 2001
After the death of my father, the Government of Sierra Leone arrested my mum =
and my kid brother on the allegation that my father was a front man to the =
late dictators of Sierra Leone. All my father assets were confiscated, by the =
present government and during this injustice; my brother and my mum were =
maltreated and tortured. From this trauma, my mum fell sick and died. After =
the whole incident, I went through my fathers document and I found out that =
he lodged $12 000,000.00 (twelve million dollars) with a security vault =
before he died, out side my country and he intended investing it before his =
untimely death.

 Sir, my intention now is to invest in your country, in any profitable =
business you deem fit.

 I will be grateful if we come into joint business partnership. Because of my =
family background I shy away publicity. Precisely, I prefer staying away from =
well know public figures in any country. Hence I won't want my name mentioned =
to any one, as I still want to stay away from the scrutiny of my country =
government. Mentioning this mail to anyone may put me in a big mess and cause =
me to lose the money. As soon as I receive you consent I will immediately =
forward the contact and all other information of where and how to collect =
this money

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks

Mr. Azziz Bashir
