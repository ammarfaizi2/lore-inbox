Eric,

You are being helpful and this is a good thing.
Sure anyone can join T13 for $800/year and up to $10K in travel cost.
Anyone can join T10 for $10K/year and additional $10K in travel cost.

Any other class/level of membership is worthless.  If you can not vote why
bother.

I do not remember meeting you when I was working with VP Skinner in
the Longmont office, the division of firmware for all of Maxtor.  This
could be that you were part of the Quantum merger?

Regardless, I may be hard to understand.  The drive companies are harder
being mimes until recently.

Cheers,

Andre Hedrick
