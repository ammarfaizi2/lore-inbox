Nobody chooses to work with MS, they merely take the job that's offered.

I didn't choose to use MS, I merely chose to be able to pay the rent. 
The choice is basically use MS or don't work in the computer industry.

Hell, I'd even take a pay cut if someone had a Linux job on offer. 
Never seen one... never likely to either in the near future.  MS 
completely owns the business world (and it's not like I've not looked 
either, I'd give anything to get out of the job I'm in now but there's 
very few people hiring at the moment).

I don't think that MS are all wrong...  I even *like* Visual Studio (not 
the .NET one though, beta1 was unusable).  It's just the creeping vendor 
lockin that I hate.
