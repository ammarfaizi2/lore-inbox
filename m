In any case, "no objections" and certainly "no response" is not the same
as "being granted permission".  You can not take silence as a positive
outcome to these questions, unless you're on a deathwish to get sued.

You need *explicit* permission of the author in order to use any code
in a way not covered by the license under which that code is distributed.
