"A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer that you've
never heard of can render your system inoperable" -- Leslie Lamport

You *do* realize that the last company that tried to sell us this sort of

it up so badly?

This assuming that your corporate security officers allow the traffic through
the firewall.

As Randy Bush likes to say on the NANOG list: "I encourage my competitors
to design their networks this way"....
