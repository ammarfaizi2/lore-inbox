The kclug archives claim to run until the second week of october 1993.  I 
just haven't sorted through them that far yet.

Please don't beat on them TOO hard, I think they're on an ISDN line or 
something...

(The reason for limiting the search to mid 1992 is that by they they were 
already up to 0.95, so 0.01 was no longer relevant...)
