A very very very quick look at the code shows that:

 - It looks nice / clear
 - It's horribly broken in at least two area :

 DO NOT USE BITFIELDS FOR DATA ON THE WIRE !!!

 and

 Where do you handle endianness ? (no need to shout for
 that one).

(Or in general, do not use bitfields period ....)

bitfields format is not guaranteed, and is not endian consistent. 

Ben.
