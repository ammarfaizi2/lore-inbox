Not I.  The slides for my last meeting were done as TIFF files and I used xv to
display them.  Plus, the most recent documentation I wrote for one of our
mainframe applications was done with vi and LaTeX.  "What, in addition to the
printed copies, you want a copy of the Word document?  There is no Word
document.  But I'll convert it to Rich Text for you and you can take it from
there."  If my employer didn't require me to use them occasionally, I'd delete
every Microsoft product on my laptop.  It's not that I have anything against
proprietary software.  It's just Microsoft that I despise.
