To quote from their press release:

"Hundreds of files of misappropriated UNIX source code and derivative UNIX
code have been contributed to Linux in a variety of areas, including
multi-processing capabilities. The Linux 2.2.x kernel was able to scale to
2-4 processors. With Linux 2.4.x and the 2.5.x development kernel, Linux now
scales to 32 and 64 processors through the addition of advanced Symmetrical
Multi-Processing (SMP) capabilities taken from UNIX System V and derivative
works, in violation of SCO's contract agreements and copyrights."




To my understanding, this hasn't been proven... most of what I have read
says otherwise.

If this is proven false in the IBM lawsuit, wouldn't this statement become
grounds for a libel lawsuit on behalf of the authors of this functionality?
