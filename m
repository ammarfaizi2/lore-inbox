I'm not a big fan of this solution, but it's definitely a better 
solution than a closed list. The acceptance depends on whether the group 
of people you want emails from accepts it (and if you subscribe to a 
mailing list be sure to exclude it from this mechanism or the mailing 
list administrator will immediately kick you from the list).

And be aware that it doesn't help against all spam - spammers know how 
to fake headers...
