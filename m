Ummm, the quote about "UNIX is starting to smell bad" is much, much older.  I
think I first heard in the 1989 Baltimore USENIX, when Pike was the featured
speaker, and his talk was "Why workstations don't work", where he outlined
Plan9.  If it wasn't the Baltimore USENIX, it may have been Salt Lake city,
Dallas, or the Boston one.
