Sounds interesting...

Once concern about global URL in general, it tends to be occupied
by specific pattern, like accesses from one process or to on dir.
It prevents to realize locality.

I think it's better to have limitations like;
	entries for same process would be limited to 2/3
	entries for same dir would be limited to 1/3

Does this mean for each process recording last recent 16
accesses to FAT file system ? If true, pid would be eliminated.

I guess it's better to record nr_slots for this entry.

As implementation issue, if number of entires is small enough,
we can use an array, not a list.

I think super_block can be retrieved from inode, any other intention do
you have?


In addtion, we can do follwoing to check the exact match case;

	0. Record hash value of file name in struct fat_lookup_hint

	1. Check hash value to find exact match case,
	1-1. If matched entry is found, check if file name and
	     file name retieved from dirent corresponding
	1-2. We found the entry

	2. Get hint value, if there seem to have locality
	2-1. Check locality of access pattern for this PID and this
	     DIR.
	2-2. If we relize access locality, return hit value so that
	     it covers a potential working set.
	2-3. Use hint value as start position of dirscan.
