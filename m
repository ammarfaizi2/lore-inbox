I have made a little test, at which the receive interrupt is 
disabled in that state. It seems to be no improvement to the 
solution of just trow away the bytes of the FIFO. In both 
cases characters got lost.

So I think you are right, it would be the best to make the 
simple solution with flushing the UART receive FIFO till the 
flip buffer implementation will be reworked.
