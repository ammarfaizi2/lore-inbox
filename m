This would be a shame, as he has been a valuable resource..
Why has the list become more restrictive?

I think that this is one list where we have to keep the ability to post
from individuals separate from the need to make sure that their ISP or
company is compliant to a set a of rules..  The LKML can't toe the
strictest of lines, without loosing some possibly valuable
contributors..
