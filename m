Hi Alan,

Will you incorporate Andre IDE patches into the 2.2.19preXX
kernel? If not, do you have any plan to do so in the very near future? 
I know this issue has been discussed before. But there has not been
any progress.

I have been following the kernel development for years. I have seen
many drivers added to the kernel. Some weren't working properly
and had to be removed quickly. Strangely, the IDE patches drag on
and on after all the kernel releases.

Are you still concern about the stability of the driver?  

Regards,

Jeff
