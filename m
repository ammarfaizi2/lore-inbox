It means I can do anything on my ipaq I can do anywhere else. I can run 
multiple apps at a time. I can run X11. I can run the palm emulator even ;)

Its the same reason Linux is valuable on an S/390 mainframe. Its a common pool
of apps, environments and tools. Anything your PC can do, my ipaq can do.
