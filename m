Ok, I'll grant that.  :)

I think a BK clone is detrimental to the overall open source SCM world, 
is my main point.  I was thinking more along the lines of "useful to 
'the cause'" ;-)

Well, I disagree with that assumption too :)  My main objection is that 
a BK clone would divert attention from another effort (such as OpenCM), 
with the end result that neither the BK clone nor OpenCM are as good (or 
better) than BitKeeper.

Interesting...  Here's the link, in case others want to check it out:
