That is a very bold statement which is incorrect. I remember reading at 
least one post to lkml from a company who is using the Taskfile ioctls and 
having a lot of praise for them. Sorry I delete older lkml stuff so I can't 
quote you the post but I am sure you could find it in the archives if you 
tried to look.

Considering your massive amount of changes which are, A) completely 
uncoordinated with Andre, and B) going well beyond what one could consider 
cleanup, I am still waiting to see you place your name as IDE maintainer... 
Clearly you have taken over maintenance now so stand up to it.

Best regards,

Anton
