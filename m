this being an fpga, why not have various contents for it, such as all
the heavy lifters required for theora encoding, for instance,
so, you take 5 of those cards, and build a digital recorder that can
encode 4 tv shows in real time while viewing them at the same time,
you can sell the device for video surveillance, and so on...
