	No...  I'm say that their right to free speech does not trump
my right to not have to listen to it or download it and I determine
the criterion, they don't.  I have, in my right to free speech, the
right to say screw off, I don't want to hear it.

	Excuse me???  Clue alert!  I'm not subscribing anything to any
spam mailbox.  I'm not doing jack shit to subscribe myself to anything
to do with them.  I am leaving bait around for them to screw themselves,
but I certainly have the free speech right to do that, now don't I?
I don't go to them and say "subscribe all these addresses".  I don't
say to them, send E-Mail here.  They are trespassing on my systems,
clearly stepping over well delineated boundries.

	I'm really lost by your reasoning on this one.  "Subscribing my
mailbox to a list of 'spammers' to avoid associating with them, with the
knowledge that you loose some valuable mail" makes absolutely no sense
what so ever.  The legitimate mail I may or may not loose has no bearing
on the sugarplum or teergrube systems (which is what I'm assuming that
you are elluding to).

	Tough...  I find the speech offensive, I don't have to listen
to it.  If I find that the level of offensive speech from a particular
source exceeds all value, then I have the right to block it.  They don't
like it, they have a right to change.  Like I said...  I don't take
active action against them.  They have to come to me.  They come to
my web site and step over my limits and contact my systems.  I'm not
going to them.

	Destroying my freedom is just as bad.  I have the freedom to
choose and I have the freedom not to be plagued by the vermin who have
harvested my addresses and are using them in a way that violates my
acceptable use on my addresses.

	Not a problem.  Won't be the first time and won't be the last time.
I deal and so shall they.
