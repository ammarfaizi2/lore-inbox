Somehow there is a problem: a user can explicitly put "noexec=on" and it 
will be silently ignored if the kernel doesn't have PAE support. I guess 
that currently no message is written because "noexec=on" is the 
_default_. Still, it would be fair to the user who added "noexec=on" on 
its command line that if it is not respected, either because the 
hardware doesn't support it or because the kernel doesn't support it, we 
display a warning saying it's hopeless.

I'll send a patch if it seems meaningful to you,
