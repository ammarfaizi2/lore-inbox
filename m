Well, it would be nice if it was signed off by him, but John is
nowhere to be reached.

So I signed it off myself, as in:

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

; that should be okay.
