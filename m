Don't forget the fact that 2.4 is the first kernel you
managed to get stable under high load since 1.2.

Both 2.0 and 2.2 didn't get stable until Alan took over
and Alan's 2.4 fork got stable some 4 months before your
2.4 tree got stable.

I think you've pretty much proven how well random
development works.

Rik
