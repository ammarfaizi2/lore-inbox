> I am playing around with RH beta roswell and noticed that is has GRUB instead of lilo. I know lilo is still available but I like GRUB's boot screen. My question is how do you upgrade kernels with this thing? Is there a howto somewhere? Also, I have a duel boot system with win98 but I can't boot it. The two os's show up on the boot screen but only linux boots.
