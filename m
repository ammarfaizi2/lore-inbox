...does that remove any memory copies???

To be best does not mean that there's no place for improvment.

Can anybody please help me and tell me where to start understanding what
tux does?

www.tux.org does not seem to be the right place :-(

I don't want to make linux bad or stand on anybodys toes. I'd just like
to improve linux like everybody else and I do not know every single
peace of source code floating around the world by heart ;-)
