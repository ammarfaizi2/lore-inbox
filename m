I have decided to write a open source version of v.90, called OpenModemTalk, itwill work like : (OpenModemTalk) (--) (Emulate V.90) (--) (V.90 ISPs server). This will fix current issues I have writing my Supra pci modem, namely patents, it can be done like they did with http://www.openH323.org/, if it doesnt work, theres always K56 flex, shheeeshhh...
