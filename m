Hi,

Sorry for the slow response, I've had a lot of work to do recently.

Do you know any other examples?

In this particular case we are saved by the fact that the snapshotted kernel
memory reflects the state from before the operation, so the kernel will
perform it again after resume.  However if the suspend failed we'd add the
freed page to the LRU which would be a mistake (I think it might be prevented
by checking the page's refcount before putting in back on the LRU).

We're talking about the situation in which no one waits on the I/O that's
completed asynchronously in interrupt context.

I assume that the freezing of bdevs makes this impossible with respect to
filesystems, but there are other types of I/O, like the networking, which are
independent of that.  Also, if someone uses a block device or a partition
directly, will the freezing of bdevs save us?

Could you please explain why you think so?  We just fail the suspend if there
still are any uninterruptible tasks after the timeout, so I don't see the
reason why these tasks should enter the refrigerator.
