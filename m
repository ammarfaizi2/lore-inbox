Yes, this book is very outdated, and quite badly translated from German.
It also has big technical mistakes if I remember well some reviews I've
read (I do not have the book myself). I would recommend :

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1584502843/
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596002556/

They are not perfect either, but much better and up-to-date that the one
you quoted.
