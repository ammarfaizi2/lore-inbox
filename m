Yesterday I thought to give 2.6.0-test9 a try after I stopped testing 
around -test5. Everything runs quite well but my mouse has some issues :)
For information, my mouse (connected via PS2) has buttons left and 
right, a mouse wheel which is also used as the middle button and one 
button at the left side and one at the right.

On 2.4.22 wheel and buttons left, middle and right worked perfectly, 
altohugh the side buttons weren't recognized. Now on 2.6.0-test9 with 
the new input system the side buttons work, unfortunaly the middle 
button doesn't. I tried the evtest program to exclude any wrong 
assumptions that X could provoke, but I don't get a MiddleBtn event, 
especially it isn't even supported:

$ ./evtest /dev/input/event1
Input driver version is 1.0.0
Input device ID: bus 0x11 vendor 0x2 product 0x6 version 0x38
Input device name: "ImExPS/2 Logitech Explorer Mouse"
Supported events:
   Event type 0 (Reset)
     Event code 0 (Reset)
     Event code 1 (Key)
     Event code 2 (Relative)
   Event type 1 (Key)
     Event code 272 (LeftBtn)
     Event code 273 (RightBtn)
     Event code 275 (SideBtn)
     Event code 276 (ExtraBtn)
   Event type 2 (Relative)
     Event code 0 (X)
     Event code 1 (Y)
     Event code 8 (Wheel)

I did take a look over the mouse code but I really don't know the border 
conditions. All I see is that on psmouse_connect the middle button is 
put in anyway, so I really wonder, who cleared the bit again. Any 
advice? [.config and dmesg attached]
