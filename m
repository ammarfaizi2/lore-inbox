These are in fact the points I wished your opinion about...
Actually these are requirements (like others said), not
use restrictions. btw, IANAL and IP rights are a minefield.
Since their code is C++ I already rewote everything in C, but it
also contains the binary firmwares which I can't rewrite. That's
why I asked you about the license.
It's likely Echoaudio will change the license in the next release
to a dual GPL/custom license, so this will be no more an issue.

Thanks for you answers.
