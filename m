The x86 version has been cleaned up and isn't _that_ bad, though it
could definitely use some comments and I don't like the "Lxxx" labels,
I'd rather either use number with the "nb" or "nf" GAS constructs or
use real words labels. Looking at it though, I fail to see the need
to get it generated by gcc in the first place :)

The PPC version that was proposed is horrible.

That's not too much, you could probably afford having a one page header
to the suspend image with those informations and the page copy loop
(provided by the suspended kernel so you don't have _any_ compatibility
issue and can even do it from the bootloader one day...)

We already have the shutdown() callback or we can simply use device_suspend()
with a D1 parameter instead of D3 or D4. That's what I'd do...

Looking at swsusp code in current 2.6, when do you do that pass ? On the
shutdown pass, you call devices_suspend(4); which is fine. But I don't see
where you call devices_suspend(X) on the resume path. IMHO, that should be
done from the boot kernel after loading the suspend image and before
starting the resume process. Your mdelay(1000) for waiting for DMA to settle
down is PLAIN WRONG imho, even dangerous. (And typically, an USB controller
will still be hapilly be DMA'ing all over your memory). That's what I call
idling devices at this point, and that's where I'd call devices_suspend(1),
and we should do that for kexec too.

Ben.
