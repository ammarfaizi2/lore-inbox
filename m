I would be interested in seeing this test suite as well.

Also, if anyone with any background on the subject can
chime in on the RH test suite and how the Linux Test Project
compare/overlap/differ, that would be good to know too.

The main Red Hat test suite is a version of Cerberus (originally from VA
and much extended), its all free software and its available somewhere
although I don't have the URL to hand, Arjan ?
