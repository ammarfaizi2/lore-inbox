Not that the 71.x drivers don't still work for old cards.  My TNT2 is
doing just fine at the moment.

They are also planing (they claim) to offer packages for the older cards
(at least I read someone was planning to continue offering packages for
the older driver series.)

Of course I might have problems when I try using 2.6.14, although 2.6.12
has no problems.
