This isn't a good idea as there are many issues affecting both kernel
series and some people looking for support wouldn't even know where to
ask their questions.
In Addition, some right issues (e.g. copyright violations) are discussed
here not regarding kernel development directly.

If you want a more compact overview just have a look at kernel
traffic[1]

see you,
