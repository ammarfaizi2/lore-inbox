Link! Thank you. I clicked thru to:

2.1.1 Character Sets

The character set used by UDF for the structures defined in this
document is the ... OSTA CS0 character set ... defined as follows:
...

Between your English and their English, I conclude,

I should expect to see 8 or 16 bits per char.  Specifically, when I'm
looking at hex bytes, if I see x08 then thereafter I should see 8 bits
per char thereafter, but if I see x10 then thereafter I should see x10
bits per char.

That sure sounds easier than UTF-8 is, to decode visually from a
hexdump.  For example, I now think, with "OSTA Compressed Unicode", also
known as the "OSTA CS0 character set", the $'\xE2\x82\xAC' x20AC â‚¬ "EURO
SIGN" will always appear as the plain hex byte pair x 20 AC.

With this much context in place, now the 2004-04-23 guess of "a problem
with 16 bit characters vs 8 bit characters" makes sense.  That guess
says cid 8 maybe works better than cid 16, maybe especially when we need
cid 16 to express a char outside of the x00..FF range.
