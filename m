Lots of patches now include the "Signed-off-by" tag.  I'd like to
hop on the bandwagon, but I haven't followed all the discussion
so I don't know exactly what I would be signing off on.

If the semantics of "Signed-off-by" has been decided upon,
perhaps a Documentation/SubmittingPatches update is in order?
