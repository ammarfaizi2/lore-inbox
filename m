A new version of the gdbstub patches for the i386 kernel is available.
It installs in kernel sources 2.0.24+, including 2.0.36 and 2.1.120.

Go to http://www.gcom.com and take the "Linux" link for browser
download.

This patch allows two Linux machines to be connected via a serial line
with one machine able to perform kernel level source code debugging on
the other.
