Well, I offer this patch under the GPL, so anyone (including you) can do it.

But I would like to be able to submit further patches without "adult
supervision", so I hope you don't mind my pressing the issue:

Can you please be more specific? What purpose does this exclusion
serve, that would be realistically achieved otherwise? You already
have a GPL license from the author, and a way to contact and uniquely
identify the author.
