Hi Linus,

please pull from: 

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git
release

This updates the ACPICA core interpreter to the latest,
which includes a number of bug-fixes from simulation
and workarounds in response to failures in the field,
plus a resource manager update from several months ago
that has already shipped in some other operating systems.

This patch enables interrupt-mode of the Embedded Controller.
Polling mode can be restored with "ec_intr=0" if necessary.
At least one major Linux distro has shipped a version of this
already without complaints.

A key fix is for bugzilla 5483 where Linux now tells the
BIOS only once about its Processor Driver Capabilities (_PDC).
This is for compatibility with BIOS in the field that were
confused by Linux and not confused by Windows.
For us it means that on systems which could run either the
acpi-cpufreq or speedstep-centrino drivers, only the
(preferred) speedstep-centrino driver will load and
acpi-cpufreq will not load.  So if somebody configures
only the non-preferred acpi-cpufreq, it will not load.
As the major distros ship both, I don't expect this to
be a problem.  I believe that the long term direction is to merge
these two drivers into one to make configuration idiot proof.

All of these patches are in the latest -mm, and have been
in previous -mm patches for various tenures.

This will update the files shown below.

thanks,
-Len

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20060113
    
    Added 2006 copyright.
    
    At SuSE's suggestion, enabled all error messages
    without enabling function tracing, ie with CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG=n
    
    Replaced all instances of the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT macro invoked at
    the ACPI_DB_ERROR and ACPI_DB_WARN debug levels with
    the ACPI_REPORT_ERROR and ACPI_REPORT_WARNING macros,
    respectively. This preserves all error and warning messages
    in the non-debug version of the ACPICA code (this has been
    referred to as the "debug lite" option.) Over 200 cases
    were converted to create a total of over 380 error/warning
    messages across the ACPICA code. This increases the code
    and data size of the default non-debug version by about 13K.
    Added ACPI_NO_ERROR_MESSAGES flag to enable deleting all messages.
    The size of the debug version remains about the same.

    [ACPI] better fix for pnpacpi regression resulting from ACPICA
20051117
    
    Rather than tweaking acpi_walk_resource() again not return end tags,
    modify the pnpacpi code to ignore them.
    
    The pnpacpi resource type switch statements now include all known
    types in the order that they're defined -- so it is easy to see
    what is not implemented.  The code will squawk only if it sees
    a truly undefined type.

    [ACPI] enable PNPACPI support for resource types used by HP serial
ports
    
    PNPACPI complained about and ignored devices with ADDRESS16,
ADDRESS32, or
    ADDRESS64 descriptors in _PRS.  HP firmware uses them for built-in
serial
    ports, so this patch adds support for parsing these descriptors from
_PRS.
    
    Note that this does not add the corresponding support for encoding
them in
    preparation for _SRS, because I don't have any machine that supports
_SRS
    on these descriptors, so I couldn't test that support.  Attempts to
encode
    them will cause a warning and an -EINVAL return.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051216
    
    Implemented optional support to allow unresolved names
    within ASL Package objects. A null object is inserted in
    the package when a named reference cannot be located in
    the current namespace. Enabled via the interpreter slack
    flag which Linux has enabled by default (acpi=strict
    to disable slack).  This should eliminate AE_NOT_FOUND
    exceptions seen on machines that contain such code.
    
    Implemented an optimization to the initialization
    sequence that can improve boot time. During ACPI device
    initialization, the _STA method is now run if and only
    if the _INI method exists. The _STA method is used to
    determine if the device is present; An _INI can only be
    run if _STA returns present, but it is a waste of time to
    run the _STA method if the _INI does not exist. (Prototype
    and assistance from Dong Wei)
    
    Implemented use of the C99 uintptr_t for the pointer
    casting macros if it is available in the current
    compiler. Otherwise, the default (void *) cast is used
    as before.
    
    Fixed some possible memory leaks found within the
    execution path of the Break, Continue, If, and CreateField
    operators. (Valery Podrezov)
    
    Fixed a problem introduced in the 20051202 release where
    an exception is generated during method execution if a
    control method attempts to declare another method.

    [ACPI] acpi_register_gsi() fix needed for ACPICA 20051021
    
    Use the #define for ACPI_LEVEL_SENSITIVE instead of assuming
    non-zero, because ACPICA 20051021 changes its value to zero.
    
    Also, use uniform variable names:
    edge_level -> triggering
    active_high_low -> polarity

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051202
    
    Modified the parsing of control methods to no longer
    create namespace objects during the first pass of the
    parse. Objects are now created only during the execute
    phase, at the moment the namespace creation operator
    is encountered in the AML (Name, OperationRegion,
    CreateByteField, etc.) This should eliminate ALREADY_EXISTS
    exceptions seen on some machines where reentrant control
    methods are protected by an AML mutex. The mutex will now
    correctly block multiple threads from attempting to create
    the same object more than once.
    
    Increased the number of available Owner Ids for namespace
    object tracking from 32 to 255. This should eliminate the
    OWNER_ID_LIMIT exceptions seen on some machines with a
    large number of ACPI tables (either static or dynamic).
    
    Enhanced the namespace dump routine to output the owner
    ID for each namespace object.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051117
    
    Fixed a problem in the AML parser where the method thread
    count could be decremented below zero if any errors
    occurred during the method parse phase. This should
    eliminate AE_AML_METHOD_LIMIT exceptions seen on some
    machines. This also fixed a related regression with the
    mechanism that detects and corrects methods that cannot
    properly handle reentrancy (related to the deployment of
    the new OwnerId mechanism.)
    
    Eliminated the pre-parsing of control methods (to detect
    errors) during table load. Related to the problem above,
    this was causing unwind issues if any errors occurred
    during the parse, and it seemed to be overkill. A table
    load should not be aborted if there are problems with
    any single control method, thus rendering this feature
    rather pointless.
    
    Fixed a problem with the new table-driven resource manager
    where an internal buffer overflow could occur for small
    resource templates.
    
    Implemented a new external interface, acpi_get_vendor_resource()
    This interface will find and return a vendor-defined
    resource descriptor within a _CRS or _PRS
    method via an ACPI 3.0 UUID match. (from Bjorn Helgaas)
    
    Removed the length limit (200) on string objects as
    per the upcoming ACPI 3.0A specification. This affects
    the following areas of the interpreter: 1) any implicit
    conversion of a Buffer to a String, 2) a String object
    result of the ASL Concatentate operator, 3) the String
    object result of the ASL ToString operator.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051102
    
    Modified the subsystem initialization sequence to improve
    GPE support. The GPE initialization has been split into
    two parts in order to defer execution of the _PRW methods
    (Power Resources for Wake) until after the hardware is
    fully initialized and the SCI handler is installed. This
    allows the _PRW methods to access fields protected by the
    Global Lock. This will fix systems where a NO_GLOBAL_LOCK
    exception has been seen during initialization.
    
    Fixed a regression with the ConcatenateResTemplate()
    ASL operator introduced in the 20051021 release.
    
    Implemented support for "local" internal ACPI object
    types within the debugger "Object" command and the
    acpi_walk_namespace() external interfaces. These local
    types include RegionFields, BankFields, IndexFields, Alias,
    and reference objects.
    
    Moved common AML resource handling code into a new file,
    "utresrc.c". This code is shared by both the Resource
    Manager and the AML Debugger.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20051021
    
    Implemented support for the EM64T and other x86_64
    processors. This essentially entails recognizing
    that these processors support non-aligned memory
    transfers. Previously, all 64-bit processors were assumed
    to lack hardware support for non-aligned transfers.
    
    Completed conversion of the Resource Manager to nearly
    full table-driven operation. Specifically, the resource
    conversion code (convert AML to internal format and the
    reverse) and the debug code to dump internal resource
    descriptors are fully table-driven, reducing code and data
    size and improving maintainability.
    
    The OSL interfaces for Acquire and Release Lock now use a
    64-bit flag word on 64-bit processors instead of a fixed
    32-bit word. (Alexey Starikovskiy)
    
    Implemented support within the resource conversion code
    for the Type-Specific byte within the various ACPI 3.0
    *WordSpace macros.
    
    Fixed some issues within the resource conversion code for
    the type-specific flags for both Memory and I/O address
    resource descriptors. For Memory, implemented support
    for the MTP and TTP flags. For I/O, split the TRS and TTP
    flags into two separate fields.

    [ACPI] ACPICA 20050930
    
    Completed a major overhaul of the Resource Manager code -
    specifically, optimizations in the area of the AML/internal
    resource conversion code. The code has been optimized to
    simplify and eliminate duplicated code, CPU stack use has
    been decreased by optimizing function parameters and local
    variables, and naming conventions across the manager have
    been standardized for clarity and ease of maintenance (this
    includes function, parameter, variable, and struct/typedef
    names.)
    
    All Resource Manager dispatch and information tables have
    been moved to a single location for clarity and ease of
    maintenance. One new file was created, named "rsinfo.c".
    
    The ACPI return macros (return_ACPI_STATUS, etc.) have
    been modified to guarantee that the argument is
    not evaluated twice, making them less prone to macro
    side-effects. However, since there exists the possibility
    of additional stack use if a particular compiler cannot
    optimize them (such as in the debug generation case),
    the original macros are optionally available.  Note that
    some invocations of the return_VALUE macro may now cause
    size mismatch warnings; the return_UINT8 and return_UINT32
    macros are provided to eliminate these. (From Randy Dunlap)
    
    Implemented a new mechanism to enable debug tracing for
    individual control methods. A new external interface,
    acpi_debug_trace(), is provided to enable this mechanism. The
    intent is to allow the host OS to easily enable and disable
    tracing for problematic control methods. This interface
    can be easily exposed to a user or debugger interface if
    desired. See the file psxface.c for details.
    
    acpi_ut_callocate() will now return a valid pointer if a
    length of zero is specified - a length of one is used
    and a warning is issued. This matches the behavior of
    acpi_ut_allocate().

    [ACPI] Avoid BIOS inflicted crashes by evaluating _PDC only once
    
    Linux invokes the AML _PDC method (Processor Driver Capabilities)
    to tell the BIOS what features it can handle.  While the ACPI
    spec says nothing about the OS invoking _PDC multiple times,
    doing so with changing bits seems to hopelessly confuse the BIOS
    on multiple platforms up to and including crashing the system.
    
    Factor out the _PDC invocation so Linux invokes it only once.

    Fixed a problem within the Resource Manager where
    support for the Generic Register descriptor was not fully
    implemented.  This descriptor is now fully recognized,
    parsed, disassembled, and displayed.
    
    Restructured the Resource Manager code to utilize

    large switch() statements.  This reduces overall subsystem
    code size and code complexity.  Affects the resource parsing
    and construction, disassembly, and debug dump output.
    
    Cleaned up and restructured the debug dump output for all
    resource descriptors.  Improved readability of the output
    and reduced code size.
    
    Fixed a problem where changes to internal data structures
    caused the optional ACPI_MUTEX_DEBUG code to fail
