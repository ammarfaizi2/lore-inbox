Hi;

After LK switched to digest-only some time back I wrote an awk digest 
expander since I manage the list volume by filtering on key words in the 
subject field.  Recently some messages with headers indicating a digest are 
actually coming through as individuals which really tarts things up.

While the digest expander is my problem, keying on reliable email headers 
it is significantly easier than coding logic to tell if the message is a 
real digest or an individual message.  It would be very helpful to let the 
group know if there is a problem with digests and if the headers will 
accurately reflect the message content.

Thanks,
Tim.
