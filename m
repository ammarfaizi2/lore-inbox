RH9.0 is sufficiently ancient that there is no SATA support.  IIRC the 
drives themselves did not become available until around the time of 
fedora core 1's release.

You would be far more able to handle modern hardware if you downloaded 
the FC4 set of iso's and burnt them to a fresh set of cdr's.
