Dear Friend.
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Alwani M. Sood, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. 

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. 
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. 
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of twenty two million dollars $22,000,000,that I have with finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. 
I have set aside 20% for you for your time and patience.please send a reply through this email address with your full contact information for more private and confidential communication.Please reply to my private email address:(alwanisoodpvt@netscape.net)
God be with you.

Alwani M. Sood.
