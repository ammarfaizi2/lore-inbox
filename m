That's a pretty broad statement to make considering the wide range of
hardware and uses.  Certainly there are many kernels that you could
declare "unstable" (at least wrt certain thing, vm, ide, etc) without too
much argument though.

If you're just looking for a good repository of Linux tests and testing
information, take a look at the Linux Test Project at
http://ltp.sourceforge.net

Thanks,
