Thanks a lot!
I didn't realized what exactly was needed...
I thought I could compile in 2.4.22, since 2.6.0
was not working...
Anyway I fixed it, thanks to the user module that
let me set up that cvs dir.
So now I'm writing on my neatly working Debian Sid,
with my nice kernel-driver-adsl-connection on
my 2.6.0 Linux.
I really thank you *VERY MUCH* for your GREAT help.
:-)))

All the best,

*Guldo*
