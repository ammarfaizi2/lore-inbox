I did not thought that I have to send changes in my CV and in positions
to you or to linux-kernel. I try very hard to not disclose this type
of information, because of I thought that nobody is interested in what
I do and where I do that, and that presenting myself with one constant
email address serves other to remember that this Petr is really still
same Petr, and not someone else. Maybe SubmittingPatches need chapter #0,
--
When you send patch first time, please include list of all your positions,
so we can track which companies participate on Linux kernel development
through you.

If you send patch later, please include list of changed positions, so
we can properly update list of this companies.

and into lklm FAQ:
--
Q: Can I use my xxxx@yyyy.name, yyy@yahoo.com, xxx@mail.cz email addresses
   for my posts?
A: No. Please use one you randomly choose from all email addresses you
   have (and do this random selection each time you post message, so grep 
   through archive can reveal compaines supporting Linux kernel).
