Randy,

Thanks for the patch, but it does not work for 2.4.26.  The kernel panic I get
("Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel.")  is
generated by the init() function in init/main.c.  Willy's patch applies to
init/main.c, perhaps yours should now as well (i.e., in later kernels)?  (I have
not tested Willy's patch, but he claims success with a 2.4.23 kernel.)

I like your approach better because I do not have to set a time, it just keeps
trying in a loop.  Since mounting the rootfs is a critical step, I don't mind
the infinite looping until success - especially with hot swappable devices.  I
had nice functionality on a 2.4.18 kernel, but would rather keep current with
the kernel.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you think might be possible, as well
as a timeframe, if at all possible.  Thanks.

Bill
