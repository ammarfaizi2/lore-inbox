It already has, for years. Like it or not, certain questions/issues
*do* get raised. If the FAQ can capture at least some of these, it
saves bandwidth on the list.

Anyway, since both you and Daniel are unhappy about the entry, I
figure it averages out to be neutral :-)

It's kind of like the Australian Senate, which for the last 15 years
or so has managed to piss-off governments of both of the major
parties, and has been called "obstructionist" and "unrepresentative
swill" at various times, with government calls for "reform" (read:
transformed into a rubber stamp) from both sides. This probably means,
on average, they are doing the right thing. Certainly the voting
public seems to be happy with the situation.

Not that I should compare myself with the Australian Senate. What I do
is far more important.
