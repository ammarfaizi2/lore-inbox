You could start with Joe Pranevich's "Wonderful World of
Linux 2.4" at
http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=1999-10-03-001-05-NW-LF

There have been a number of improvements and features added
since but any 2.2 -> 2.4 features summary should indicate
much of what you would loose in a 2.4 -> 2.2 transition.
