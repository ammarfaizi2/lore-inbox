No, I am the crap - I used a self written script to generate the former 
41
OSS fixes - but was too lazy this time and edited the mbox file for
sending these 10 patches :-(

Now, I will add my full name without &auml; (which btw, is not an
&aelig;) - I guess you fetched the patch via an lkml archive, or do I
have to resent 5/10?
