Hi,

this is my first try of a 2.5.xx kernel, so if this one was announced 
already... please don't hurt me ;-)

I've tried to compile a somewhat little kernel and got this one:

fs/built-in.o: In function `init_nfs_fs':
fs/built-in.o(.text.init+0xa7a): undefined reference to 
`rpc_proc_unregister'

Bye
  Michael
