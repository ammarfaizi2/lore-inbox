You are right technically, but hey, you informed them of a copyright
violation which may mean a lot of internal hassles. Without giving them
any slack because what they are doing _IS_ stupid, calm down a little. 1
day is a hardly a timeframe in which they can respond adequately, in
particular at the end of the week. You should have allowed them a week
or so...
