Why? You're not a signatory to the Berne Convention and thus surely you
don't need to honour it? You can just re-use the GPL'd code without our
permission, and make your law permit it. You could adopt US copyright
law with exceptions for the Linux kernel. There's precedent for such
exceptions -- see what the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988
has to say about Peter Pan, for example:
http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880048_en_28.htm#sdiv6

And enacting the US patent law is absurd -- why would you want to copy
something as broken and abusable as that?
