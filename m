I've no objection to taking "heres links to packages for xxx distro"
texts if people want to write them, but I don't have the time, nor
knowledge to add these for every distro out there. And these days quite
a few distros are starting to ship module-init-tools and the likes, so
the situation shouldn't be too bad.
