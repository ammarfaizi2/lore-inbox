Hi,

Is it just me or is the Gimp visibily slower with pre11 compared to pre10?

I am editing 6 Megapixel files (2800x2048) and things like rotations seem to 
have delays that were not happening with previous kernels.  My box has 320M.
Seems that pre11 does not swap out as much as pre10 so Gimp has less to work
with.
