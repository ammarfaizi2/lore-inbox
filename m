Subject: Reg lilo.conf changed and system doesn't boot

Hi,
I know that this is not the place to ask this question.Please forgive me.
I changed the lilo.conf on my machine(redhat 2.2.14-12 kernel) and it
doesn't boot up. I don't have
a boot floppy to boot. I have another disk which has an older version of
linux(2.2.6). I can mount the disk if I boot from the other
disk(2.2.6). Can I
in some way alter the lilo.conf of my disk(2.2.14) and boot linux from
that. Please tell me any ideas to do that.

Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
satishj
