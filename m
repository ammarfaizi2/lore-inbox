Hi all!

There is a good news (at least for me), my company would like to have a Linux 
driver for its card. And this great task is mine. So I'm going to write a 
driver.
But I don't know where to start. OK, the interface and how the driver should 
be written is clear(more or less) but I don't have any documents for it. It 
is a PCI card. I've got the card and the documentation. But I can say I have 
only the card, the documentation is in Japanese... :-(((

There is a win driver for it but the source code is not available.

Can anyone give me some online docs about PCI bus? (I found some info about 
PCI-9050 chip but it doesn't contain what I need.) Or some advice? (no, I 
don't want to learn Japanese :)

Thx

	Gabor
