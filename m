Even if I'm not forced to /use/ it, if it gets shoved into the kernel, it
is being forced on me. You are talking to /kernel developers/ here, who
care for the /code/; not /users/, who only care for whatever their
distribution dishes up (leaving out experimental/unstable/nonsensical
stuff).

Check. Can't, due to basic design problems.

Check.

Has happened before with code from the same people. Can't even get them to
clean up for considering for inclusion. Check.

Yep.

Sorry, the community has been sometimes abrasive, but on the whole helpful
and polite to newcomers. In this case they have been accused of everything,
including dishonesty... and this has been going on for the 4th round right
now.

Looks that way. And /again/ there are people who tell nicely what would
have to happen to fix ReiserFS 4 to get it into shape.

And who will take over when the authors make for the woodwork, yet again?

And what stops you from creating -rfs4 just for checking? If it /really/ is
so great, word will go round and people /will/ check it out.

Addressed at the ReiserFS crowd? Sounds about right...

A /very/ good question...

And again, historically "Work towards /my/ vision", "Linux is doomed if you
don't do as I say", etc arguments go nowhere. Rightly so, they are usually
from people who don't have a clue. If you /really/ can do it /that/ much
better than Linus & Co, go ahead and show us.
