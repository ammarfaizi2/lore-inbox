Richard,
In the linked document, it is stated "Linux is normally used in a
combination with the GNU operating system".  I only wish to clarify, how can
GNU be an operating system without the kernel? Don't get me wrong, I don't
wish to pick a fight of any nature.  It just seems to be inconsistant with
the terms being set forth in the article.  Shouldn't it be referenced as the
"GNU programs" or "GNU components" when talking about GNU without a kernel.

Regards,
J.S.Souza

    You *chose* GNU/Linux to parallel Unix? I assume you mean that you
    influenced GNU into using a Unix base with the eventual goal of having
    some sort of GNU Unix base (the Hurd?). The words you selected above
    are rather assuming.

I decided in 1983 to develop a Unix-compatible operating system, and
then chose the name GNU for it.  In 1990, after finding or writing
most of the necessary components, we started developing a kernel for
the GNU system; that kernel is the GNU Hurd.  Since Linux was working
long before the Hurd, people mostly use GNU with Linux instead.

See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html for the history of GNU.
