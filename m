I have updated some 8-way kernel comparisons running dbench as recently
as a couple weeks ago. Although, I do not know of any specific
Linux(TM) vs Solaris(TM) benchmark results on the lse web site. ;)

Speaking of OLS, Is there any interest in an lse-tech BOF or get-
to-gether of some sort in Ottawa this summer? It would be nice
to put some more faces to names from the conference calls.
