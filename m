It is.  Unless you couldn't endless of useless bugs reported from users
we can't debug and stupid whining trolls likle you as giving back.  While
we definitly can't redefine you definition of "giving back" your version
is at least no appreciated.  So please stop trolling here now and go somewhere
else.  Don't expect me and others to support you violating the clearly defined
copyright license (GPLv2) we gave everyone to our code.
