At least one opinion is that everyone whose code is used would be entitled
to sue the offender if they shipped a full GPL kernel. Think "class action"
When people start linking with fragments of the kernel and the like it
gets much more complicated, and depends upon whom.

On the bright side nowdays people you may have on the copyright
enforcing side of a kernel dispute include IBM, HP, Compaq, AMI, LSI,
Cirrus Logic, AMD, Intel, .... none of whom I suspect would ever have
signed copyrights over to the FSF.

This is not neccessary in most civilised countries, and in fact the current
US policy seems very suspect when compared to current WIPO treaties. Things
like the DMCA also changed the rules a little.
