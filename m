Dave, 

    thanks a lot for the effort of writing this document. I think it's very
    nice. 

    I think that a very useful thing for have a quite large group of people
    testing 2.6pre is a similar document that explain "what should I do with
    my distribution to test 2.6pre?". For example, I have an uptodate
    mandrake 9.1: it would be very nice to have a page where I can
    download package/learn what to do to test a 2.6kernel. Anyone knows if
    there is such a page over there? Otherwise, it would be nice that the
    distribution's gurus could advice us... 

    Thanks again to all linux-kernel people,
                                              Romano
