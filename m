I'm one of members to maintain one version of the Japanese Configure.help.
I also sent this question to Linus who coming in Japan, he denied this idea...

IMHO, using environment variable is not adequate; national language
designation should be set to the make option. The behavior of make
config must not be influenced by such a LANG environment variable.
You might concern about displaying national language character
(because it depends on the LANG variables), but it have merely
relations to `i18n text'.

Current distribution to the i18n texts are all outside from the core kernel...

BTW, i18n Configure.help needs `quality assuarance' because in English
all developers can recognize whether help text is correct or
not. However, i18n text can read for only each national people, so
developers cannot know about these correctness.  From this point of
view, I agree with Linus's comments because of this concerns.

But, there are some version of i18n Configure.help translations.
What a waste to make them sleep...
