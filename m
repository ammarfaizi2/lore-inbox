Actually, in this area, Linux has MSWindows beaten hands down - the amount 
of profanity in the Windows 2000 source code was actually not that great. 
However, what MS lacks in profane comments, it makes up by sheer oddness - 
some of the comments looked like they were written by someone on acid, and 
were extraordinarily long (50 lines of comments to 3 lines of code was a 
norm). Amusing reading overall, however.
