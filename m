European law,  for now, doesn't  allow software patents. For  the same
reason  that we  have a  right of  fair use,  and a  right  of reverse
engineering. We value freedom more than money. Maybe this will change,
but it'ld be the worse thing  that could happen to whole Free Software
movement - and even to the Open Source movement, and to most companies
that  do non-free  software too.  You  should speak  to lawyer  before
saying such false statements.

By threating to use patents to prevent us for ever using the same idea
as you do (even if they grew up in our own minds), you've just added a
last proof to the fact that you don't care at all about Free Software,
and even  Open Source  or the  Linux kernel, but  just care  about the
money you can earn.

This is your right, but don't  ask us to follow your rules then. Since
you are _not_ on our side.
