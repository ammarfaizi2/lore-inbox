It is likley that this project will not go to the market with Linux as 
the OS. The original intention was to make available all kernel 
changes and ship object modules for the specialised hardware. 

Reading the GPL tells me that really it is not correct to ship 
modules either, athough I know people do it.

For these reasons I feel I will have to use some other OS.
What I don't understand is how people in the embedded world live 
with this and the reason for embedded Linux unless you are 
effectively running a PC with some apps.

Cheers

Simon.
