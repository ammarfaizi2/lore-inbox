Well, another option would be to have workshops on a more frequent
basis, target the workshops on fewer areas and restrict the invitees 
to those doing work in fairly closely related areas.  This would 
allow us to foster the synergy of teamwork.  The only obvious downside 
to this IMHO would be the loss of the contribution of from those 
working in dissimilar areas.  This might be a significant loss, since
sometimes a great solution to a problem will come from someone who
is thinking "outside the box" of the current development team.

On the other hand, we could have the annual Kernel Workshop consist
of the folks who were at this year summit and simply add other 
workshops that are more narrowly targetted.
