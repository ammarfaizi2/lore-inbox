i tried 2.4.21-rc6 as i was told it might fix the mouse stalling on
heavy disk IO problem and i would like to report that it DOES fix them
for the most part, even certain compiles/benchmarks/stress tests that
could stall my pc for seconds now affect the mouse for mere fractions of
one second, situations that used to cause short stalls are now a thing
of the past

2.4.21-rc6 is the best kernel i have tried to date and i have tried many
on my quest to get a smooth mouse

i dont subscribe to lkml, so if you have questions please CC me
personally

hope this input is helpful

Daniel
