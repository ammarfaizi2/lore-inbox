This is no restriction. This here just asks for copyright notice and 
conditions to NOT be removed, which is perfectly fine. Section 6 never 
overrides this. Section 6 asks not to restrict rights, and above clause 
does not restrict rights.

I find perfectly fine. Is just a request to include the copyright notice 
and conditions along with the binary. Section 2, clause c does not 
override. Does not infringe Section 6 either. What is the problem?

Hahaha, those are no restrictions, so no problem. Summarizing this 
license, it ends up like this: "Copyright bla bla bla. Keep 'em goddamn 
copyrights and disclaimer or else you have no rights to copy, modify, 
sublicense, redistribute, sublicense bla bla bla. Software provided 'as 
is'. Clear?"

GPL is ok with that.
