http://cqi.com/~humbubba/3sm.html  is version 0.3 of
a Forth-like language I've been working on. It has 
about the the functionality of the dc command at this 
point. It's a 3 stack virtual machine with a state
variable or virtual register for what size an int is
at the moment. What I suspect may be of interest here
is that it is all in main(). Or whatever you decide to
call main(). __linux_openfirmware_sniffer() maybe.
But I'm quite clueless on the possibilities. I just know
it's a lovely fresh pile of pony manure, and you never know, 
there MAY be a pony in there. 

So Appy Olidays

right now.
