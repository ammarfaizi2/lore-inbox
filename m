Okay then lemme try to give you a reallife case... I *can* compile the
kernel perfectly alright, but let's face it, it can easily end up as a
medieval pain in the ***. The 2.2.20+reiserfs patch that I managed to
compile didnt swallow the reiserfs that my Suse7.3 linux actually
installed already. Well that's beyond ISA in this case but then here we
have a lot of old ISA-ethernetcards, for example, that I'd just simply
like to work properly....  

Let's face the bare fact : Linux life could be *way* more comfortable...
This stupid Win2k or even *brrr* XP ^H^H^H detects all the hardware
fine when installing. Even ISA. So should Linux. 

My 0.02c
