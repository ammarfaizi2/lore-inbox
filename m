Hello,

I wish to be personally CC'ed the answers/comments posted to the list in  
response to this post


I can't trace any reference addressing how the memory associated queue is 
managed?
Please check slide 13 from this link:
http://engr.smu.edu/~kocan/7343spring05/slides/chapter07.ppt


i mean according to  which algorithm the requests queued will be served? 
which process will be given first the priority? is  it first come first 
served

thanks
