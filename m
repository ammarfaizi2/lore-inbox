Hello!

	I was wondering if anyone has had any luck with 2.6 
on a Dual Opteron system. I have a Broadcom 5702 ethernet 
card, and the network starts up but it seems slugish. Lilke 
yobind and and nfs don't start up properly. They fail on 
startup and I have to run the init scripts by hand. I am 
also running a crazy Redhat Enterprise Server Beta release. Also 
I was wondering if anyone has an idea what a good distro 
for x86-64 bit architectures is?
	
thanks 
	-Anand
