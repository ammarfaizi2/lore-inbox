Hi Jonny,

The notebook is a Compaq Presario 701LA (700 series). It is a notebook
for the Latin American market, you can find more technical information
regarding this notebook at: (in spanish)

Almost all the time I ran in console mode my tests, no graphic mode as
it freeze very soon the kernel after booting.

Thanks,
