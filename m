In the cases I know it was more like 6 month of hospital and taking
pills for the rest of the life.  Many people above 60 have seen worse.

I have zero knowledge about what happened to her and therefore won't
comment on the legal case of her disappearing.  If you are looking for
a legal comment, ask a lawyer.  If you have a suspicion you can back
with evidence, contact the law enforcement authorities.  If you have a
personal opinion and like to share it, talk to a friend.

In either of those cases, LKML is _not_ the place to pester.  Go away.
Shoo.
