I got a "spam URI" reject from OSDL's mail server from CC'ing Andrew - I don't 
know if anyone else's servers are that paranoid, though.

I have a feeling that if the spamfilter rejected it from being sent directly, it 
might have a problem with the mail from the mailing list, too.

Dunno, though.  And yes, it was a big patch.  There were some formatting issues - 
the lynx dump was the original author's idea (just created a huge diff).
