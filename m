gcc 2.95.3 does compile faster than 3.3, but I don't think 3.3 is simply
worthless:

This is kernel 2.4.21-ac1, with the .config at the end of this message.
egcs is plain egcs 2.91.66, gcc 2.95.3 is plain gcc 2.95.3, gcc 2.96 is
gcc-2.96-118.7.2, and gcc 3.3 is gcc-3.3-1mdk.

gcc 3.3 produces both the largest and the smallest kernels. It just
depends on your compile options. :)

I probably have more important things to do, but, *maybe* I'll be able
to find the time and energy to run some benchmarks and see what's
fastest. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations?
