Who, exactly, do you think creates resources in the first place which
form the basis of commercial software which is eventually cloned?

A significant portion is from tax-funded univerities and research labs.

You think people writing Free Software don't do these things?  You
think that billions of dollars worth of activity isn't spend on
developing Free Software?

Likewise people who put enormous effort into developing free software,
whether they are commercial entities or not - it is reasonable for
them to protect their investment.

Unfortunately some other entities want to deprive free software
authors of the fruits of their work.  Think about it.  It cuts both ways.

This is true, but it is true both ways.  The more companies are
adversarial by using money and law to protect themselves, the more
free software advocates feel the need to have a confrontational
attitude.

I'm not advocating confrontational - just pointing out that the
natural consequences we observe apply to _both_ sides of the debate.

There's a lesson in this for smart commercial entities: don't
antagonise open source folks, cooperate with them, and they will give
back to you.

My sympathies to all activists everywhere.  I have a Jewish friend who
is a peace activist in Palestine right now, and two of her
co-activists were recently killed there.  Kinda puts things into
perspective.

Actually, it just might.  Free Software / Open Source is such a
tremendous force for good - because it speaks to basic human desires
for freedom to do our own thing - that it is a source of power unto itself :)

Not because it claims to be right.  But because it _is_ right :)
