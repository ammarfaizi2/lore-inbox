Greetings!

Thanks for trying to send me an email. I'm sorry but I did not receive it because I don't know if you are a person or a mass-emailing program. I accept email from any person (whether I know them or not) but I do not accept email from mass-emailing programs unless I have explicitly authorized them. 

I need you to click on the link below so that I know you are a person. Then please re-send me your email. You will never have to repeat this step.

I am very much looking forward to reading your email.
