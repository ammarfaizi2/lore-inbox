Subject: DMA support for toshiba IDE controllers

Does anyone know if there is any DMA support for the
toshiba IDE controller's in many of their portable
models such as the older porteges and librettos?  The
controllers support DMA, but not in linux.  I'm not
sure what toshiba's policy is on documentation.  They
used to be pretty stingy, but I heard they have
recently opened up of lot of their doc's, like the
oboe IR controller for instance. 

Thanks,

Alex
