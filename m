[Resent due to networking troubles]

Linux 2.6.10-rc2-bk1 has problems on both on a Sony VAIO laptop and PowerMac 
8500 (with G3 upgrade board).  

Linux 2.6.10-rc1 works fairly well on the laptop, but Linux 2.6.10-rc2
fails without comment in the middle of software suspend.  Upgrading to
Linux 2.6.10-rc2-bk1 doesn't seem to help.  Most of the suspend output
doesn't make it to the serial console, so i hand-copied it below.

The PowerMac 8500/G3 does not come up at all.  Upgrading to 2.6.10-rc2-bk1
fixed a couple of minor PPC problems, but it's still failing.  I can't see
what's going on because it appears that the video parameters don't match
the framebuffer geometry and almost everything is black with a few thin 
diagonal lines of dots and dashes (which don't look like morse code...).  
I have not mananged to get serial console to work on this machine, so i'm
rather clueless.  So all i can offer is the .config for it (see below).  
I tried to regress this problem and it seems to have appeared somewhere 
between 2.6.8 and 2.6.9-rc1.

It does seem to be specific to CONFIG_FB_CONTROL, as if CONFIG_FB_OF is set
instead, the PowerMac will boot OK, but all that will appear on the screen
until 'xdm' is started is a cute penguin.  The nearly-blank screen with 
CONFIG_FB_OF only set goes back at least until 2.6.3, after which i lost
patience chasing the problem down.

In addition, to that on the PowerMac, when things are running normally
(under 2.6.8 for example), switching to a virtual console from X windows 
causes the vertical refresh rate to be set to about 47Hz, i.e. the screen
loses sync.  It can be fixed (until X windows is visited again) using 'ssh' 
from another machine and doing a 'fbset' with the correct vertical sync
rate.  That problem has been with me for quite awhile.
