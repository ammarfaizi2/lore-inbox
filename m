Steve,

 [shameless plug to follow]

 you may add MSC.linux (http://www.msclinux.com) to your list. We 
support it since day one. Probably not a mainstream reference, but we 
are working in an application field that can make good use of XFS.

 [end of shamelse plug]

 Your list of users is great, but without mainstream support its growth 
will be severely limited.

 OK, but I understand people are working to change that for 2.6 :-)

Cheers
Martin
