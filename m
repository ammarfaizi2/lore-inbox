I'm using the TrueMobile 1150.  It was about $100 as I recall.  One of
the antenna leads is just barely long enough (it takes some work to get
it in) but it works fine.  (And does monitor mode, with the appropriate
patches.)

A couple of decent sites for linux-on-dell are:
http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/G.Wilford/Inspiron8500/ - lots of
good info, its where I went when I first got my dell set up.
http://www.gotontheinter.net/ - my site, mostly relating to mobile
kernel patches (mostly aimed at the I8500, but thats due to lack of
submissions/requests more than anything else.)
