As is d_lock, which didn't exist when those comments were made.

Doh!

Actually, splitting d_name like this is not so bad (as long as the
compiler doesn't add padding) because the important fields (hash
and len) are first and are compared for all non-matching dentries
in __d_lookup().

Might not be too hard (even if it temporarily kills performance)
to add atomic counters for each of these fields where they are
referenced in dcache.c, namei.c and e.g. fs/ext3/*.c (which is
only using d_inode, d_name, and d_parent).  Run a find and a
kernel compile and dump the counters at shutdown.
