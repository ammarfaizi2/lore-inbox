I've tried the 4.3.15 driver, and it is behaving in the same manner :

(82544GC device):

still the same latency.

(82546EB devices):

  8:        16 bytes 1845 times -->    0.96 Mbps in 0.000127 sec
  9:        19 bytes 1105 times -->    0.87 Mbps in 0.000166 sec
 10:        21 bytes  951 times -->    1.28 Mbps in 0.000126 sec
 11:        24 bytes 1327 times -->    0.98 Mbps in 0.000188 sec


Now this is worse, the latency is varying between 250us and 63us 
(seems like it is depending on the iterations).

Well I did take a look in the proc files (*.info) and I didn't see 
anything abnormal (like packets dropped etc.).

However, when compare the "features" list on the web, I find that the 
82546EB has some features that the 82544GC apparently doesn't have :

"Interrupt moderation controls"   Reduces the number of interrupts
                                  generated by receive and transmit 
                                  operations. Maximizes system performance 
                                  and throughput.

"Small Packet Interrupt"          Fast detection of TCP ACKs for improved 
                                  small packet throughput.


Maybe these features are taking effect ?
