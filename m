You miss my point.

I don`t call for switching (although would like it to happen).

I call for a _better replacement for bk->cvs_.

bk->cvs loses data, which could be captured in a more sensible manner
than cvs is.
(I think that everyone agrees here that it`s not even remotely arguable)

bk->arch would regain that data back to our hands, thats what i`m proposing.
(here i presume that that data being constantly lost _is_ really useful)

I decide to conveniently skip answering that part.
(That`s a suggestion to use your imagination here, really)
