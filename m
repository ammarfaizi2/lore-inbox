Hello again LKML -
   I appreciate you all sending me messages today in an effort to solve 
my problem - based on some of the questions that I was asked regarding 
my system I pretty much figured out that DMA was enabled for the HD but 
NOT for the CD drives... Asking around in some message boards, I was 
able to determine the approprite method to enable it for the cd drives. 
I greatly appreciate that time that you all took to help me :)

Cole
