My name is Sarah Cappa.
I am a senior partner in the firm of Cappa Consultants: Private Investigators
and Security Consultants.

We are conducting a standard process investigation on behalf of HSBC, the
international Banking conglomerate. This
investigation involves a client who shares the same surname with you and
also the circumstances surrounding investments
made by this client at HSBC Republic,the Private Banking arm of HSBC.

The HSBC Private Banking client died in intestate and nominated no successor
in title over the investments made with the bank. The essence of this communication
with you is to request you provide us information/comments on any or all
of the four issues:


1-Are you aware of any relative/relation who shares your same name whose
last known contact address was Brussels Belgium?

2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a person
at the Private Banking Division of HSBC Bank PLC?

3-Born on the 1st of october 1930

4-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume status
of successor in title to the deceased?

It is pertinent that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar
with this personality that we may put an end to this
communication with you and our inquiries surrounding this personality.

You must appreciate that we are constrained from providing you with more
detailed information at this point. Please respond to this mail as soon
as possible to afford us the opportunity to close this investigation.

Thank you for accommodating our enquiry.
