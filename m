I know this is a common FAQ type question, but I haven't really seen one 
thus far in my web/usenet reading.

I am an experienced developer, mostly middle-layer/back-end web based 
applications.  I would like to start getting involved in the lower level 
programming in the Linux OS, and hopefully be able to be a contributor 
to the OS, even at some basic level, in the role of a developer.  I am 
not the "evangelist" type, just interested in the technology and in 
building technology.

Does anyone have any good suggestions as to a good book, web addresses, 
etc. that could help get me started?  I have been reading this mail 
group for about 3 weeks now and I must admit I am a little overwhelmed 
by all the different projects and issues that are "on-going".

Thanks!
