Thanks.  It's a very nice piece of work.

I think you should probably note that some sort of locking or RCU
scheme is required to make this safe.  As it is the atomic_inc
and the list_add can be reordered such that the atomic_inc occurs
after the atomic_dec_and_test.

Either that or you can modify the example to add an
smp_mb__after_atomic_inc().  That'd be a good way to
demonstrate its use.

Locking or RCU is definitely needed here.

The visibility only needs to be delayed up until this point for
the crash to occur.

So this isn't exactly correct.
