Ummm, the way I parse the above statement, you are saying that Multics was
developed to work on DEC equipment without having to use DEC software.  Maybe
we are inhabiting parallel universes, but I'm pretty sure that in my universe,
Multics ran first on GE computers, and then on Honeywell computers when
Honeywell bought the division from GE.  Note, DEC did bid for the Multics
contract but was turned down.  Maybe you are thinking of Tenex or UNIX?

The original machine was a GE-645, which was a segmented, virtual memory system
using 36 bit words.  The operating system and system software was written in
PL/1.  Bell Labs had bought a GE-645 and was one of the three development
partners (along with GE and MIT) until they withdrew in April 1969.  You might
want to browse:

for more of the history of Multics.
