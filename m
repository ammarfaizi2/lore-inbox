Some people just don't know how to tell a joke! I wonder how
many companies have "non-exclusive" licenses to UNIX from AT&T?
I don't recall SCO buying back any of those licenses. In particular,
AT&T gave a non-exclusive license to many universities, including
UC/Berkeley, where most of the student-written code came from
before there was a Linux. Don't let SCO crap bother you. They
don't have a leg to stand on. They think they "own" Unix while,
in fact, it was given away long before they latched onto its last
craze.

FYI, this DR-DOS is pretty interesting. I knew the founder of
Digital Research, Gary Kildall. They probably would do well
to check their facts before they put a history-rewrite on
their web-pages. I think the DR-DOS is a hack of freedos
and I think they might try the same thing with Linux.

Cheers,
