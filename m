The VDC report is no FUD. As the link I gave states, this is a "survey

Linux: real-time limitations.

is hurting Linux. The GPL requirement is only part of the picture.

Fair enough. Note that I'm not betting against you, I'm just trying to
point out a problem. Whether you care to deal with this is problem is
an entirely different issue.
