I saw there were some other questions on the Promise RAID controllers and
their drivers. I just thought I'd let the list know I got some beta drivers
from promise, if you want them e-mail me at freaky@bananateam.nl

Haven't had time to test them myself yet... They came in last wednesday from
promise taiwan.
