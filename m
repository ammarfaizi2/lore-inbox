	No, it's a huge point. Because there are other ways you can get the right
to *prepare* it, these include fair use, first sale, scenes a faire,
necessary step, de minimis, and probably several other things I'm missing.

	It's not clear that necessary step and scenes a faire don't. There is case
law regarding necessary step creation of derivative works for commercial
distribution. So you're simply assuming as beyond controversy an issue that
is totally unresolved.

	An elaboration of Gone With the Wind is not functional. It doesn't *do*
anything. So whether or not it's the only way to do a particular thing is
not even an issue.

	Of course, and if all it took from the original work is the only way to get
a particular thing done, it's clearly not a derivate work for copyright
purposes.

	I agree, however it is not legally a derivative work if all it took from
Linux was the only (practical) way to get a particular functional task done.
This is scenes a faire. (Did you read Lexmark v. Static Controls?)

	The symbols are not the issue. Courts have clearly held that the names of
symbols and the order of functions is not copyrightable content. Anything
that is purely functional is not copyrightable content either. If it is the
only, straightforward, practical way to do a particular thing, it's just not
copyrightable. (If you want software patents, you know where to find them.)

	Software is not the same as other works, and the analogies to
non-functional works don't always, excuse the term, work.
