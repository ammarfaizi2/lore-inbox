	Contracts for slavery are specifically not enforceable due to
the 13th Amendment, and there is also a stronger question of formation
of a binding contract in your example, because the proposed mode of
acceptance (related to the pointers I provided before) is doing
something that you might have the right to do regardless of copyright
(running the program as opposed to distributing copies).  I believe
that people write contracts all the time that prohibit distribution of
certain works with others, for marketing reasons.

	We're not talking about mythically changing the copyright
status of another work.  If your opinion is "prevailing" please
include a reference to a section of the US code, a court decision
or some reference that one could actually track down.

	By the way, I have asked a lawyer at an IP litigation firm
that we use about this and he indicated the copyright infringement case
was quite strong.
