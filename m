Which looks to me like it was released 2002-04-19 which is now more 
than 2.5 years old. That's a lot in dog-years!

Some of the technology in a Dell 1850 didn't exist in April 2002. Try 
installing a current Linux kernel system.

The current, most direct logical descendant of Red Hat 7.3 is 
probably Fedora Core 4, although you may prefer RHEL or some other 
distribution for a server like the 1850.
