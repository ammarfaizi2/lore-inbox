Gentlemen,

we are glad to show you a "piece of future" - the new LOXXON Alarm
Computer, an incredible "secret weapon" against intruders and
burglars.
By only pressing a button, the little book shaped box hermetically
protects premises and buildings up to 2000 square metres.
No installation required - just put it in place and switch it on
Failsafe and free from false alarms!
Protected are not only doors and windows but the walls, the roof and
the
foundations, too.
Worldwide alarm notification via GSM.
How long will it last to protect a 1000 square metres villa?
5 minutes - if you're slow :)!
Very importnt: Energy blackouts don't matter.
