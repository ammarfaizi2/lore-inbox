This is a recorded announcement as I'm afraid we're all out at the moment.

The Linux Kernel developers thank you for your esteemed visit but
regret that the entire kernel is temporarily closed for business. Thank
you. If you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be
contacted kindly speak when you hear the tone.

In case of emergency, we can be found in Ottawa, c/o Andrew J. Hutton, Linux
Symposium & Kernel Summit.
