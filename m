am I? hmm, that isn't intentional; looks like someone started feeding
me linux.* traffic without telling me. I've suspended bincancels there
for now, until I can sort that out.

I don't personally consider that the fact that a group is gatewayed
from a mailing list to be significant when deciding how to apply Usenet
policies to it.

well, I would have to disagree (even if you don't think that binaries
coming via the mailing list would be a problem, there is still the
question of binaries posted via news - and the recent levels of abuse
in comp.binaries.*.d, rec.*, vmsnet.* etc. suggests that there are
plenty of people who are happy to post binaries anywhere they can
regardless of the real purpose of a group)
