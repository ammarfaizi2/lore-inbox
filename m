Quoting the FAQ:

"Don't attach huge files to your post.  One major culprit is people
attaching their kernel .config file to their post."

These days people get flamed for _not_ attaching their .config to
their post :-)

Also:

"Stick to the subject.  This is a Linux kernel list, mainly for
developers."

--- developers."
+++ developers to discuss technical issues, start flame wars, and
+++ generally use at least 50% of the bandwidth on non-kernel issues.

:-)
