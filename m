The critical difference with the GPL is that it doesn't _add_ 
restrictions.
Without the GPL you may use the code however you want as long as
you don't distribute.  With the GPL, you may use the code however you
want internally, and you can distribute provided you follow some rules.
The GPL is your only license to distribute at all, so if you want to do 
so
you must follow its _distribution_ restrictions.

Besides, I never said anything about one user taking a copy another
user downloaded.  Here is what I said:

This means that if my coworker downloads and uses the software I am in
no way bound by _his_ agreeing to the license.  If I illegally obtain a
copy from him (IE: stealing from his HDD) then that's another issue.  
But
he can agree to _no_ license that limits my individual rights (Unless I
signed some draconian employment contract that lets my boss do that).
