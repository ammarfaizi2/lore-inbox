Greetings;

I am attempting to get into a wap11 radio through its usb port, because 
that port offers a way to restore factory defaults and in the year its 
been quiet, I've forgotten the uname/pw.  To access it with snmp over 
cat5, the uname & pw are a requirement.

I have rebuilt the 2.6.20-rc4 kernel with every usb or pci network related 
item I can find that looks as if it might have something to do with this 
radio, which an lsusb reports as:

Bus 002 Device 006: ID 03eb:5601 Atmel Corp. at76c510 Prism-II 802.11b 
Access Point

Did I miss something, or is this going to need a trip to a windows box to 
fix?

-- 
Cheers, Gene
