Subject: booting after new Kernel compile reboots laptop automatically

My computer is Toshiba 1555cds satellite K6-2 - 380
MHz - 4.3 GB HD - 160 MB RAM 

More hardware details are available at
http://www.eboodle.com/marketplace/product_info/details__cat_id--462,prod_id--5142326,de_id--200,name--Toshiba%20Satellite%201555CDS.html
except for the memory which is now 160MB.

I am currently running mandrake 8.1 (2.4.8-26mdk).

I was recompiling kernel to version 2.4.19 with the
patch 2.4.20-pre9 and wireless extensions patch v 15.

The compilation and installation goes through without
any errors that I could see. But when I try to boot up
with the new image (using lilo), my machine resets
itself after
linux ..............

Could anyone help me with this? I am attaching the
linux compilation .config file, along with
/var/log/boot.log

If anyone needs it I can also give them the versions
of various packages on my current system (in which I
compiled it).

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Mudit
