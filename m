Well, I think his patch is orthogonal to mine.  My ultimate target
is IA64 and it will only support node-sized memory hotplugging.

If you need fine-grained memory resizing, that shouldn't be hard to
do.  As others have pointed out, per section hotremovable is not as
easy as per zone one, but we've done a similar thing for hugetlbfs
support.  Look for PG_again in Takahashi's patch.
