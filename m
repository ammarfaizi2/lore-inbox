Or you could take the hardware approach.  Hmm, this 8-bit microcontroller
on an ISA card looks *just* like a SoundBlaster AWE32, but it's got a 2.5"
HD attached to it.  And this custom piece of hardware which I just plugged
into my DVI port is a perfect video-capture device, complete with a
FireWire interface which I can stream into an ordinary Macintosh, or
digital camcorder.  Combine the two and you can brute-force your way out of
any copy-protection system under the sun which is intended to run on a
consumer-level PC.

Sorry, but these people make me laugh.

The small-time pirate can simply copy analogue-to-analogue - it'll be
slightly off quality but more than good enough for the average Joe (look at
the number of low-grade 128kbps MP3s out there).  The big-time pirate can
*always* get hold of enough exotic hardware and/or hackery to get around
the "protection schemes".  Who loses out?  The ordinary consumer who's paid
their $$$ like a good citizen.

Strange that I haven't made much use of the DVD capability on my PowerBook.
