I don't think you need extremly advanced technology to recover data
(or even overwritten data) from damaged hard disks.  In some cases,
the only thing which has to be done is an electronic replacement.
Scanning the surface of individual magnetic disks for information is
probably out of the reach of the typical thief, but such service
doesn't cost a fortune anymore either.
