Subject: PROBLEM: 2.4.20 Hangs, 2.4.2 didn't
Message-ID: <264578704.1049712470@[192.168.100.8]>

[1.] One line summary of the problem:

2.4.20 hangs after one day of operation, when 2.4.2 gave >200 days uptime

[2.] Full description of the problem/report:

I have just rebuilt a server, previously running 2.4.2, which
had an uptime of several hundred days, to run 2.4.20. The
HD had crashed, so it has a new HD (larger WD hard disk).
The net card also changed to an NE2000 compatible from eepro.

The other main change is using ext3 rather than reiserfs on
a partition with very large directories (>100,000 files
per directory). I have not (yet) got htree or anything fancy
running on there, just stock 2.4.20. This doesn't mean
of course that ext3 is the culprit, though given what
it is doing is very fs intensive, I have my suspicions.

After a whole 1 day of operation, the box hung. Continued
to respond to ICMP ECHO but nothing else. Being in
a remote location (and also to be honest not knowing
what to look for - see below), I didn't try SysRq-anything.

On reboot, there was nothing in the logs at all that would
indicate the cause of the hang. Just normal stuff, then
the first line of the reboot.

So questions:
a) Any known problems that cause 2.4.20 to hang like this?
b) Next time it does this, what should I look for?
c) Is there perchance some form of watchdog patch that
   will reboot the machine if it gets stuck (presumably
   with some lock held).

The build is SMP but the machine is not.

[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):

2.4.20, hang, ext3

[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):

[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)

[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
