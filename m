It this doesn't get people to try CML2, nothing will.  I still
remember many years ago walking into the labs and hearing the graduate
students.  They were shouting stuff like "jump thru the window" and
"wave rod".  A roomful was engaged in solving "adventr", no useful
work was accomplished for 3+ days and close to a $100,000 in computer
dollars was spent after this virus ^h^h^h^h^h^h game appeared on the
mainframe.

I keep wondering if the Pirate was included....not to mention, "Witt's
End".
