Well the thing is that I like todo evil things,
like connecting sgi flatpanels to creator3d's, using
non sun blessed ( aka sub 1000$ ) ethernet cards or
sticking in wierd raid cards.

Which is why I like linux ;)

Having source is great because I can break it,
and maybe learn something in the process.
