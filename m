Subject: differences in between 2.0 and 2.1 SMP?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

What are the architectural differences between SMP code in 2.0 and 2.1?
I'm a very beginner kernel hacker and I'm still in the code grepping
stage...
it seems to me that only one of the CPUs can execute the kernel code...
is that correct?
	Sorry for the dumb question 
	Thanks
