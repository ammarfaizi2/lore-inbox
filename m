   It's a disclaimer that I don't have a choice in having attached to
   my email.

Just because you have to do it doesn't mean anything to me.

That disclaimer is a liability for me, because it means that
I could get into trouble if I put your bug report into a database (for
example) and then forward that posting to other people privately in
order to work on the bug.
