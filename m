Eerh, dumb question here: Is this MiniPCI Wlan cards in general or how ?
I ask, because i've seen MiniPCI Wlan cards and i've seen cards that in
fact are PC-Card Wlan cards and a PC-Card-to-PCI bridge put together on
a MiniPCI card, just adding another PC-Card slot to your notebook and
inserting a Wlan card there (Dell TrueMobile 1150).
