Hi,

Firstly stupid me never saw the Bugzilla link first time through. This 
is now logged under Bug 6172

This is a vanilla 2.6.15.4 kernel no patches.

Several attempt were made to start NFS with /etc/init.d/nfs start. I 
understood this would start portmap. Am I wrong? Possibly my iptables 
provented it.  I have been experimenting with arno firewall.

Thanks for responding and sorry for logging twice.
