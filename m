From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>

i was profiling the scheduler on x86 and noticed some overhead related 
to SECCOMP, and indeed, SECCOMP runs disable_tsc() at _every_ 
context-switch:

        if (unlikely(prev->io_bitmap_ptr || next->io_bitmap_ptr))
                handle_io_bitmap(next, tss);

        disable_tsc(prev_p, next_p);

        return prev_p;

these are a couple of instructions in the hottest scheduler codepath!

x86_64 already removed disable_tsc() from switch_to(), but i think the 
right solution is to turn SECCOMP off by default.

besides the runtime overhead, there are a couple of other reasons as 
well why this should be done:

 - CONFIG_SECCOMP=y adds 836 bytes of bloat to the kernel:

       text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    4185360  867112  391012 5443484  530f9c vmlinux-noseccomp
    4185992  867316  391012 5444320  5312e0 vmlinux-seccomp

 - virtually nobody seems to be using it (but cpushare.com, which seems
   pretty inactive)

 - users/distributions can still turn it on if they want it

 - http://www.cpushare.com/legal seems to suggest that it is pursuing a
   software patent to utilize the seccomp concept in a distributed 
   environment, and seems to give a promise that 'end users' will not be
   affected by that patent. How about non-end-users [i.e. server-side]?
   Has the Linux kernel become a vehicle for a propriety server-side
   feature, with every Linux user paying the price of it?

so the patch below just does the minimal common-sense change: turn it 
off by default.


Adrian Bunk:
I've removed the superfluous "default n"'s the original patch introduced.
