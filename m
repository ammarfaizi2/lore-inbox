Hi guys,

I'm testing a little program that generates the last line of my signature.
I'd like to test it with a bunch of different /proc/cpuinfos (*any*
architecture - m68k, sparc, sgi, alpha etc) so I can experiment with these
and get it right.

I'd be happy if you could email me (privately) with a copy of your
/proc/cpuinfo for my programming pleasure? Thanks!

Once I've tested it, I will release it into the big bad world. You'll be
the first to know.  

Cheers,
Alex
