Subject: Silicon Image 3114 - is there an all linux kernel driver out there?

Hi all,

 I am trying to figure out if this SATA adapter is
fully supported in Linux. The information out there is
rather patchy. Silicon image web page claims that they
ship Linux drivers to whatever customers they have.

 Tyan has a download for RedHat and SuSE saying it's a
driver for 3114, but the package has 6514 names in it.
Is 3114 the same as 6514?

 Would those modules happen to work with other kernel
versions?

 Thanks!
 Konstantin
