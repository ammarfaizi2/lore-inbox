Ah, but the problem with this is that it's *wrong*.

Disk is not always decimal. Nor is it always binary. Most disk sizes are  
an unholy mixture of the two that deserves a stake through the heart,  
where 1 GB = 1,024,000,000 bytes.

If even people here do not understand how this works, then can it possibly  
be the right way of doing things?!

A current "9.1GB" hard disk would, if dc didn't lie to me, be either 9.3  
GB (decimal) or 8.7 GiB (binary).

So you'll be saying "9.3 milliards of bytes" - or is it "billions" where  
you live?
