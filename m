Erik postulates a "one MIGHT" legal argument, and gets threatened with bodily
harm?  I think you've given up any moral high ground regarding threats.

You may want to just take a few days off - you're apparently not attached to
the same reality as the rest of us:

Maybe if you apply the Bible Code to it, it's clearly stated, but all I see is
a reference that the MODULE_LICENSE macro will accept a parameter of
"Proprietary", and then goes on to say "it's there so the module in question
can be treated properly - just like a Jew in Warsaw in 1941 had to wear a star".

There. I said it.  The esteemed Mr Godwin says we're now free to get on with our lives.
