Are you speaking about PEOPLE who react on emails by flaming, or
something of list filtering "technology" ?

About people, then..    There I can't help, unfortunately.

We have lots of people subscribing on Hotmail addresses, and only 
complaint I can voice is that those people will at times let their
mailbox quotas overflow, which leads to bounces, and then subscription
revocation...  (Hard controlled quotas are not unique to Hotmail, nor
people who let them overflow...)

There is this small thing called spam...

We have various filters (see my other posting), but obviously they
are not infallible, a few spams do leak thru, and earn new filter
rules (if I can think up something suitably specific, while generic..)

A somewhat better anti-spam filter method, than what we use presently
is to use strictly CLOSED list -- e.g. must be a member to post.
I have seen what kind of pains closed lists are, I even moderate
couple small ones.

However we are deliberately running "open for posting, subject to
filters" policy, which lets questions and reports to come from
non-subscribers.
