Rob,

You know, I would have to say you just waxed my arse all over the mailing
list and left it in the mop bucket for cooling off.  The beauty is I can
now laugh about it, and see you are so raw over the issue.  Have a case of
chapstick to help smooth over the burn.

It is kind of cool you had an atomic bomb to fry me, if I cared I would
respond in the old ugly manners, but hey I asked for it.  Feels like the
the dude in the Memorex commerial.

Cheers,

Andre Hedrick
