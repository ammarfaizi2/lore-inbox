Hi Alan, Andries.

You probably know that I run the Linux Kernel Version History website
and produce CD's with collections of kernels on them. The kernels from
0.99.14 to date are complete thereon, but like you, I'm missing the
0.99.13* series except for 0.99.13 and 0.99.13k and I'm also missing the
original patch for 0.99.10 although I have the actual kernel tarball.

If you do find any of the missing kernels, either in patch or tarball
form, I would be very interested in obtaining a copy thereof.

Best wishes from Riley.
