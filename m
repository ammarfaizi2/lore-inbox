We have a netfinity 5100 (including aic7xxx scsi controllers) that
fails to boot with kernels newer than 2.4.18. The last few lines in
the boot messages are:
hda: LTN485S, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: attached ide-cdrom driver.
hda: ATAPI 48X CD-ROM drive, 120kB Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.12
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00

After this point, the system has locked up. (sysrqs don't work, etc)
The system is a dual pIII. acpi is disabled. This machine has worked
stably with 2.4.14 and 2.4.18 for quite a while. (it is a fileserver,
and isn't touched often)

I have tried running with noapic, to no avail. I have attached
complete boot messages and .config. How can i get more info out about
where it is dying?

Thanks in advance for any help...
