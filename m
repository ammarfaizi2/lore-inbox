Sir/madam,
May i use this medium to introduce my self.I am daniel johnson the director in charge of auditing and accounting department of 
Eco bank Cotonou Benin republic.
A foreigner late Mr Williams Barnes Who is an American business merchant had in his fixed deposit account the sum of twenty 
one million five hundred thousand united states dollars($21.5us) but unfortunately Mr Williams Barnes and his wife and two 
children were involved in the Egyptian airways plane crash of31stOctober1999. 
(http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/egyptair990.list/).  and they all died.Since the daeth of this customer none of his family 
members had been traced and now in the cause of auditing the activities of the bank we came across this fund.
Considering our position myself and the director decided to use our position to present a foreiner as the next of kin to late 
William Barnes whom should be paid this money.The director will use his position immedaitely to move this money to you.
The strategy we have put in place is that a reliable lawyer attorney has perfected arrangements with a diplomat who will be 
used to deliver this money to you by diplomatic process, this simply implies that the diplomat will personally carry the money 
which we shall seal in security proof metal box to your designated address in your country however the contents of the box will 
be declared to him as family treasure so that he will not know the contents to avoid greed of diverting the fund to an unknown 
destination.
All we want from you is your personal phone number and your address in your country where you want this diplomat to bring the 
money.We shall sign a memorandum of understanding once you indicate your interest to assist us and for your assistance you 
shall have 25% of the total fund while we take the rest 75% and any expenses by both parties must be deducted before sharing.
Please get back to me by return mail or call my phone number +229 42 01 59 and remember that we are still in active service 
therefore this transaction must be kept very confidential however if you do not want to be part of this deal just ensure you do not 
disclose this letter to any other person.
I am hoping to hear from you asap.
Regards
daniel johnson
