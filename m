Ok, so this means that the given binary table which represents the 
firmware is forced to be under a GPL license.  Let's also say, for the 
circumstances, that what amounts to a hex dump is the "preferred form" 
of the firmware.

Does that make everyone happy?

Then get the vendor the say that "the binary form of the firmware" can 
be converted to GPL as necessary.

Now, this may open them up to reverse engineering, but so what.
