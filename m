Hi there,

just in case anybody cares: the lockup behaviour that I observed starting
mozilla 0.9.2 on kernels 2.4.6-pre8 and 2.4.6-final does not occur on
2.4.6-ac2 (haven't tried with 2.4.7-preX). Appearently, I was the only one
experiencing that problem anyway. Ah well, I won't complain now that
evertything is working.

Cheers Felix
