Subject: mpc855 hangs on boot before console_init on upgrade from 2.4.22 to
 2.4.23

Hi

We've developed a custom board deploying a mpc 855 (ppc). With kernel 
2.4.22 and linuxppc-2.4.22 patch from  /pub/linux/kernel/ports/ppc/2.4 
as well as some platform specific adaptions we are able to boot and use 
2.4.22 succsessfully. Unfortunately, jffs2 has a nasty gc-bug so we want 
to upgrade to 2.4.23 and maybe later to 2.4.31.

It was possible to apply all our custom patches to 2.4.23. No ppc-port 
patch was applied as we assume this was incorporated into 2.4.23. 
Unfortunately we can not boot anymore. Using BDI, a md xxxx log_buf and 
some printk debugging reveals "Decrementer frequency..." as last 
message. Therefore, kernel hangs when jumping into console_init in main.c.

Our hardware did not change in the meantime nor did our custom patches. 
Any clues on how to proceed/chase down this bug? Patch 2.4.23 was a 
rather fat one to start tracking...  Supposedly, we're encountering a 
memory bug, but switching on memory checks in the kernel hacking section 
didn't help neither.

Any help is most welcome. Please CC me as well.

René
