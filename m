I recall a fellow named Tigran Aivazian submitting lots of
kernel patches from an @sco.com address, for one.  And then
there's Caldera OpenLinux, of course.  I don't think it's
relevant though...they can submit as much GPLed code as they
want and still claim a violation of a contract pertaining to
some other non-GPLed code that was copied into Linux.
