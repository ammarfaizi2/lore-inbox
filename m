Am I going to sue the RTAI people for doing something like what they are
doing, considering it "illegal" or "immoral"? Obviously the answer there
is "no". It's not illegal to disagree with my opinions (*).

But I don't want to have their FUD down my throat either.

Getting people to say "patent issues" to some random inquiry isn't all
that hard. It's something that it's easy to blame all your problems on,
and it's something that the open source crowd tends to lap up a bit too
eagerly in my opinion ("ooh, if it weren't for those evil patents, we'd
rule the world").

It's a hot button, and as such a really easy target for FUD.
