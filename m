Linus,

A reasonable explanation.  However, this begs the question as to 
**WHY** you are so opposed to kernel debuggers in Linux.   Code 
reviews don't catch hardware bugs or other types of performance 
issues related to bus architecture, etc.

Opposition to a kernel debugger in Linux, at least from the 
view of some folks, is a case of someone using inferior methods
because of ideaology.  

Not meant as a recrimination, but you've just made the case for
kernel debuggers in Linux.

:-)

Jeff
