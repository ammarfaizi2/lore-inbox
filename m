I agree with your sentiment, but you mis-characterize one thing. Jamie 
was stating that his interpretation of the BitKeeper license forbade him 
to use the free version of BitKeeper because of some of his non-kernel 
related activities. This does seem to be a fair interpretation of the 
license, according to clause 3-d, and has nothing to do with his 
politics. Jamie is stating that it would be illegal for him to use 
BitKeeper. Whether or not you agree with the use of BitKeeper for linux 
kernel maintenance, it would seem like this is an unnecessarily onerous 
clause that prevents some individuals from participating on an equal 
footing with everybody else.

Clause 3-d:
            Notwithstanding  any  other  terms  in  this  License, this
            License is not available to You if You and/or your employer
            develop,  produce, sell, and/or resell a product which con-
            tains substantially similar capabilities of  the  BitKeeper
            Software,  or,  in the reasonable opinion of BitMover, com-
            petes with the BitKeeper Software.
