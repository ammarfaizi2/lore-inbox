This is in the series of "don't do that" ...

Request originator had edited "From:" address to list address,
and there was no "To:" or "Cc:" header at all.

Overall, any request needing approval from listowner is likely to be
_ignored_.   You do see the amount of traffic in these lists.
>From that you can have a vague idea of how much admin junk listowners 
get...

See  http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html   for futher guidance.
