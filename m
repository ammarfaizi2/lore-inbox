Minor gripe here...

Whilst it's true that a lawyer should get involved with these things, I
think it's also perfectly reasonable for someone to ask for input from
LKML, /. or other interesting places.

OP may already be planning to speak to a lawyer, and just wants to take 
tidbits of info/experiences/etc from others to help the lawyer's
research.
