of IBM, which is determined to invest US$1 billion, this year alone, in
Linux. "IBM's passion really dragged us into this movement," he added.

He also said: "I can get a glimpse of the strong will of IBM, which has

shall be no free ride on Linux to be enhanced by IBM investing a huge
amount of money.'
