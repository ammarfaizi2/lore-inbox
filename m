It's not a guilty-by-default attitude. The DUL is a way for ISPs to
say "we can't make users accountable for email sent from these IP's,
so if you're concerned about potential SPAM, block them at your
end. We've set up a relay so our users can still send out email but
can be held accountable for abuses".

The ISP could have blocked outgoing port 25 instead, forcing you to go
via the relay. Then you'd have no choice.
