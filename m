Based on a conversation I had recently, my curiosity got piqued...

I'm not really sure how to query google on this, and didn't turn up what 
I was looking for because of that, so here's the random question:

Is there a way to make a Linux machine with a scsi controller act like a 
scsi device (is the correct term 'target'?) (such as a disk) using a 
local block device as storage?

I'm not sure it would be of general use, but I can see uses in weird or 
remote prototyping situations...

Like the subject says, just idle curiosity; I don't see having much use 
for it, but I was intrigued by the idea.
