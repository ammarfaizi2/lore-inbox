Just a thought. Suppose we forked the GPL2 license and created the Linux 
license? (Or some better name) It's kind of clear the Stallman has his 
own ajenda and that it's not compatible with the Linux model. So - lets 
fork it an start a new one.

The idea of the new license is as follows. It would be backwards 
compatible with GPL2. It's would eliminate the "or later" clause because 
we have already seen the potential for abuse there. How can one agree to 
future licenses without knowing what they are going to be? The other 
feature is that the license is only modified to provide legal 
clarification or to deal with future issues that occur as a result of 
new technology or circumstances that we don't know about yet. If the 
licenses is modified then copyright holders would then have to 
explicitly declare that they accept the modifications by switching to 
the new terms.

Anyhow - I'm thinking that Richard Stallman might be more of a liability 
to the GPL movement and that if something can't be worked out with GPLx 
then maybe it's time to just fork the license and come up with a new 
system that is crazy leader proof.

Just suggesting this as an alternative if the FSF folks insist on a 
political ajenda.
