Al,

> This is unreal! 
Yep, that is why I am looking for help.

> Have you tried 2.6.5 by the way?
Yes, it was the same as 2.6.4, which was really close
to 2.6.3 or roughly 4m.

> What is it you are benchmarking if you can say?
An internal app, sorry I can not release it.  I am
trying  to figure out what is causing it and then I
can craft something neutral to submit.  Might be a day
or two to understand what is causing this issue.

Thanks!
Phy
