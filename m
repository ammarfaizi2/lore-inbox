The development criteria used to be technically based, and that is still
the public statement.  Now, as your statement makes clear, working code
is an irrelevant criteria.

You comments immediately moved the subject from the technical merit and
correctness of the code to an ad hominem attack.  The facts, and the
code, clearly show the long term interaction and contribution.  In most
cases the code and interfaces we are talking about were written and
defined by me throughout the past decade.
