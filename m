	I'm sorry, this makes no sense. What if a user can't conveniently get the
source by mail?

	More users can more conveniently get the source by HTTP than can get it by
mail. This argument may have made sense many years ago, but it doesn't now.

	The GPL does not say you have to mail it. The GPL says you have to provide
it "on a medium customarily used for software interchange". That means *YOU*
get to pick the medium, you just can't pick one that's so obscure that
nobody could decode it. The web is just such a medium.
