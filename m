First you are insulting people (in an incredibly stupid way), now you are
spamming.

In case you haven't realised: No one is suffering from the removal of the
driver, unless he or she is using the latest -rc versions of the kernel.
Additionally, Nemosoft is publishing the driver again (check his website).
Future versions of Linux might contain a new driver. Whining, spamming and
insults won't help in any way. So stop this nonsense.
