I certainly didn't mean to offend you or not include you.  It's easy enough
to send a new patch if needed.

I'll go try to find the whole history of the discussion and see if we
left you out anywhere by accident.  I'll keep this out of LKML unless
prefer it here.

This is totally correctable though.  We'll just update the patch as
necessary.

Sorry for any trouble I may have caused or for anything I overlooked.
