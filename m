	Precisely. And it says there cannot be any.

	They are not separate since they are conditioned upon your failure to
exercise your GPL rights.

	I don't object to those because there is no additional restriction on the
exercise of your GPL rights. Conduct which is discretionary can become
objectionable if the reason is objectionable.

	I am saying that you cannot condition a decision to give someone code that
is covered by the GPL on their promise not to exercise their rights under
the GPL. You cannot impose a penalty upon someone for exercising their
rights under the GPL. All these things are additional restrictions.

	Please explain to me what you think the GPL prohibition against "additional
restrictions" means if not to prohibit the distribution of GPL works
conditioned on promises not to exercise your rights under the GPL (and
penalties for exercising them).
