Hi,

I searched the LKML archive and found a 3-post-thread relevant to my
problem between July 4th-6th entitled:
"Re: 2.4.6: Machine Check Exception:  0x  106BE0  (type 0x   9)"  here:
<http://uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0107.0/0470.html>
Like the Compaq mentioned in that post, I _also_ have a Compaq LTE 52xx
laptop (5250) which chokes on bootup.
I let this problem sit since 2.4.5 came out because that's when this
problem first occurred. Only recently did I get around to hunt down a
fix.

I understood that I was to "comment out" "MCE" in the sources.
So I did a 'grep -r 'MCE'  ./' in the sources and found bunch of
occurrences, the first ones being:
./include/asm-i386/processor.h:#define X86_CR4_MCE              0x0040
/* Machine check enable */
./include/asm-i386/cpufeature.h:#define X86_FEATURE_MCE         (0*32+
7) /* Machine Check Architecture */

So now my question is: what exactly should I comment out? One? Both? In
_all_ sources?
Please bear with me as I know next to nothing of C (or any language for
that matter).

Also: i'm not an LKML-subscriber so could you please CC: this to me?
Thanks and cheers,
-Mike
