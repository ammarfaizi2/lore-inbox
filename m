Excellent

Maybe 100 / month?

Ok lets try giving this a shot by seeing if we can get a company to let
another manufacture a specific card design for us.  We can do this by
getting people to sign up for the card once we have details. Once we
reach a threshold we charge all users and order in-bulk to the
manufacturer. How's this sound? We can use linuxwireless.org for this.

I'll see if I can get people from Conexant to agree to let us use the
old fullmac chipset design for starters, since we already have that
driver in the stock kernel.

Cool we should get an estimate to see how many cards they'd need in
order to start a bulk order.
