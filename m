	If there was a NEW field that would be exactly what I was 
asking for. When I do a query the only options I see are: OPEN, 
ASSIGNED, RESOLVED, APPROVED, REJECTED, DEFERRED, CLOSED. 
Where is the NEW? Is there somewhere else to do queries?

Im trying to help make it easier for such people to get a list
of bugs to start working on. If it looks like everything already
has an owner it looks like there is nothing to do. Im just trying
to figure out how to use it and hopefully help other people
do the same thing.

Thanks a lot.
