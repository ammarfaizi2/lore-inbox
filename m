to me it looks like your reactions are too late.

I suggest you Sistina people accept the fact the there is an open list
(better) managed by somebody else now and you all move there and use this as
a forum for your discussions from now on. Just send the new list admin a
list with your people to be subscribed ... and I can not imagine they will
refuse to help you. (Otherwise they would be as closed-minded as you were.)

Maintaining a project which got integrated into the kernel and forms a
critical part of it (if there are bugs) is not an easy thing to do, and you
should expect controversary discussions. On the one hand you want to fix
things and introduce small and large improvements, on the other hand you
don't want to take risks. Just get used to it.

You'll always have a newer version to test than the one in the kernel.
However, it works best if you try to submit your changes as often as
possible. Of course I know, this is close to impossible when you have to
redesign stuff and have to wait for stabilization ...

Good luck!
