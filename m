Hey, I resemble that remark.  I've been using an ATI XTacy 9200SE for
a couple of years now, since an nvidia card crowbared the buss & blew out 
a
motherboard.  Needless to say, I wasn't happy with nvidia over that. 
I bought a faster cpu & more ram on a different mobo for this machine.

But, get this:  Another new board, with the same cpu & ram on it, is
now running that cpu 70F degrees cooler, at 200 mhz faster on the cpu
clock.  With another nvidia card in it, running my milling machine.

I'm not a 'gamer' so the last frame per second isn't that important
to me, but its close to 1000 on a small piece of a 1600x1200 screen.

Its been my alternative since 1998, never was windows here, coming in
from the amiga world.

Don't hold your breath, its not healthy in the long view...
