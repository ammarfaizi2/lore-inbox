Having just a couple of days of vacation I got informed today that
a number of people got pissed off and decided to open a new Linux LVM mailing
list <linux-openlvm@nl.linux.org>.

Facts people complained about included:

 1. people got dropped from the list

 2. messages bouncing

 3. lack of (small) LVM patches to the Linux kernel

 4. submitted patches being ignored


WRT points 1 and 2:
-------------------
our Linux LVM mailing list <linux-lvm@sistina.com> is now completely open
in order to avoid such kind of problems in the future.

We apologize for any kind of trouble this caused in the past!

We kindly ask everybody to stay at <linux-lvm@sistina.com> or to join it
in order to avoid a mailing list split.

Thanks a lot!


WRT point 3:
------------
we will regard the Linus kernel as *the* repository for LVM driver changes
rather than our public CVS repository from now on!

In order to ease this migration we are working to create a bunch of small
patches to submit them to the comunity.

We will announce when they are available ASAP and would appreciate if
people like Alan Cox, Andrea Arcangeli and Andreas Dilger
could check them *before* we start submitting them to Linus.

Thanks a lot in advance for your support.


WRT point 4:
------------
a lot of patches send in by the comunity have been included
in the actual LVM source.
We appreciate all your valuable related work!

Nevertheless about 30 patches which would have changed too much have been
postponed for LVM 1.1 *because* we are in a feature freeze since a couple
of weeks heading to a production stable LVM 1.0.

The submitters have been informed about this fact.

We will make these postponed patches accessable to everybody and will
discuss the status of future patches in the public on the list from now on
in order to avoid any further lack of information here.

None of the patches which showed up on the lvm mailing lists
have been discarded without notice!


General statement:
------------------
Linux LVM is a Sistina GPL project and there's no danger at all
that we want to change its GPL nature!

We apologize for any inconveniences and kindly ask everybody to continue to
help us making a better Linux LVM.
