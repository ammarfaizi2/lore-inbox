Hello,

I have a DEC Venutris 5120 (Pentium 120) with a Phoenix BIOS.
After LILO loads and uncompresses these kernels the machine
reboots. I have ecountered sombody else with the same problem.
I don't know the etails of his box but do know he also has a
Phoenix BIOS (10.( I believe).

Included here is my .config, though I have tried many and none
changed the outcome.

PS> Please (b)cc me with any replies as I am not on the list.
