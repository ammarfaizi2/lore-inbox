How do I enable UDMA as opposed to just DMA? I was having trouble with DMA, 
but no trouble (other than VERY slow access) without DMA. I have an 80 
conductor cable SOMEWHERE (probably in the bottom of a box in the basement 
lol) but im almost certain the cables in there now arent more than 18 inches, 
as its a fairly stock Dell system, and has the original ribbon cables.
