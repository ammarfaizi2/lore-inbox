I did setup a list for this purpose on zenII, aka www.linux.org.uk.
See:

	http://www.linux.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/patching-time

(the name was suggested by Alan).

All it needs are some subscribers and Alan to post release announcements
there.  It is setup as a read-only list in as far as Alan is the only
person who is allowed to post to the list.
