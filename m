I think what Larry meant was that connectivity via DSL is only
available to him at an average of 100Kbit, and he therefore has to pay
for a leased line.

In the U.K., you can get 2 Mbit/256 Kbit ADSL with no bandwidth
limitations to you, for about 300 pounds/month.  However, that that is
not the same as a leased line the connection is still contended.  A
leased line is guaranteed bandwidth, (usually with a service level
agreement which will allow you to claim a refund if it fails).

The lowest price I was quoted for a 512 Kbit leased line was about
5000 pounds/year, and it varies a lot by location, too.

John.
