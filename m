Eh? huh?

Good thing Linus was attached to the "Its amazing what you can do when you 
don't know you can't do it" philosophy instead of the "If it could have been 
done, it would have been done" POS philosophy.

e.g:
I find a 100$ note on the ground. I don't pick it up since: If it existed, 
someone would have already picked it up.
