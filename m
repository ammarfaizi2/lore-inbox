Yeah, I immediately found out =) Some very good explanation on your site 
(http://bobcopeland.com/karma/). I see that you've implemented most of 
the work, and I can't really figure out any isolated development 
suitable for a school project. But please, if you have an idea, say so.

Otherwise I'll probably dig up something. Just needs to be a small 
kernel-whatever project.

Is there someone maintaining a list of non-implemented ideas for kernel 
features/drivers?
