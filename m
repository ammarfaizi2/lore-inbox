You forgot about biotech and economic factors.  Obviously it's in
USA's short term economic interest to patent using herbs for medical
purposes, that have been used for 100s or 1000s of years in other
countries.  Even better if you can then use world trade agreements to
litigate against those traditional uses too!

(See also imminent ban of all non-approved (i.e. non-industrial)
medical and nutritional remedies from EU countries).

As with all systems - if some people can get away with something, they
will certainly try!

Also, those with any semblance of power don't _have_ to bend to the
will of those with resources, but they often seem to do so.
