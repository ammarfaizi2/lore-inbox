Hi Jim,

some documentaion is well maintained while other documentation is no 
longer maintained. If it's maintained, the maintainer of the 
corresponding code is also responsible for the documentation.

If you have a plan how to restructure the documentation mail it to 
linux-kernel and you'll hear the opinion of other people.

Everything else has to be done on a file-per-file basis and usually 
requires a knowledge of the topic a documentation file covers.
