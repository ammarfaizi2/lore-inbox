	In my insanest musings, I've thought about a case where one has a
decrypting/encrypting editor and a decrypting compiler. This could honestly
make the encrypted source the preferred form for the purposes of making
modifications.

	Anyone who attempts this would likely run afoul of a legal principle known
as the "straight face doctrine". This says that one may not make any
argument in court unless one can do so with a straight face. Because of
this, lawyers that can say rather insane things with perfectly straight
faces are quite highly prized.
