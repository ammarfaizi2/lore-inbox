> can you send a report of the bug ?

There's nothing special, i turn on my computer and just connect to
internet by modem as other hundred times, i didn't overload it, not too
much disk access and not too much swapping, and after four hours i shutted
down, previously i check one downloaded avi with the mplayer, but no rtc
access or something similar who could cause a bug. I have a laptop and
move it one hour before i plug in the battery, unplug the elec. adapter,
then plug it again, nothing unnormal. But as the oops happend just before
shut down, i only remenber "page_alloc.c" sorry.
