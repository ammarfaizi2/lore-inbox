I just read about IDE PIO related hangup in 2.5.22/3.
I'm having the same problem. Also I can't compile as
UP because compile crashes then :(
Please can you tell me where to find the ide-clean-92.diff ?

I'd like to test it. I debug USB bug and it was recommended
to me to test 2.5.23 but it is hard when I can't boot it :-\
Thanks, devik
