Thank you. It is true all I want to do is help the community. I feel as
alot of people do XFree86 can not meet the needs of the community. It is
very sad that people feel that no amount of people in the open source
community can make code of the same or better quality as XFree86 in a
shorter period of time. I don't feel this way. Now I'm off to work on code
and documentation for the project. Thank you.
