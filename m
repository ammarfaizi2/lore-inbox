It would help if I said where you can download the patches from now. (-;

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13956&release_id=81853

Or just go to our project page (http://sf.net/projects/linux-ntfs/) and 
follow the links.

And of course you can use BitKeeper to get our BitKeeper repository at 
http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-tng-2.5

And a on-line view of the repository is available here:
http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net:8080/ntfs-tng-2.5

Best regards,

Anton

Hi,

NTFS 2.0.1 for kernel 2.5.7 is now available. This is a minor update, 
mainly to allow binaries to be executed by changing the default permissions 
on files to include the executable bit. This feature has often been 
requested by wine users so here it is. (-:

Sorry for the quick succession of releases but the web server hosting the 
2.0.0 patches is now off line so I had to move the location and I used the 
opportunity to release this minor update.

Best regards,

         Anton
