I'll stick with the bandwidth argument.  99.99% of the people who download Linux
don't need the Bitkeeper docs at all.  Waste of cycles.  Think what happens to
the source if we don't care at all about extra bulk.  Hint: I've got a 75 meg
compressed source file here from an embedded systems vendor that has about 5
meg that I actually use.

If Jeff wants to give me only 2.95 out of 3 points for my arguments, that's
his business.

It was fuhhhhhneee.  Get a grip please.

Well.  Could always start now, and please count the places in the thread
where I say BitKeeper is a good thing for Linux.  Commerical breaks in 
in the source tree itself are considerably less good.

Could have fooled me.  I thought that getting Linux developers to endorse
BitKeeper was a key part of Larry's business plan, which, by the way, I
fully support.  I just don't support the part that turns Documentation
into a billboard.
