Hello,

I have been looking around the internet for drivers for my RAID card. I
found drivers for 2.2, and a patch against "vanilla 2.2.x".
However, when trying to boot with that patch, I get an oops. (Got it to
work with 2.2.5.. rather old for me)
But, I want to run 2.4, and cannot find anything about this card and
kernel 2.4.

Can someone point me to a driver or a HOWTO so I can get this darn thing
to work?

Thanks,

Jens
