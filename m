Hi!

Few days ago, someone asked me for copy of latest swsusp (asking if I
still work on it and offering help). I did crude diff -ur |
mail. Then, swsusp ate my filesystem so badly that I lost latest copy
of sources.

So

*) be very carefull about swsusp on 2.4.12

*) could that person please contact me and mail that sources back?
