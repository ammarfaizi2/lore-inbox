        One other thing. No-one GAVE NVidia GPL'd material. It's available for 
them to use it, just like it is for us. If you have a problem with that, you 
may want to take it up with GNU, the FSF, and RMS, if you want to deal with 
all the slack. But that's your fight, not ours.

                                                        BL.
