I'm not taking any side in this, but:

US law != World law (and hopefully this will stay so for a long time)

Looking at the originators address and name he's from germany. FYI: 
There's no provision in the law here that denies you personal copies of 
copy protected contents assuming you own the original.
In fact you even pay for this use when buying emtpy media, regardless if 
for data backup or copying.
So what may be illegal in the US is legal in other countries and 
royalties are already taken care of (by law).
As I do assume that in case of this posting the actual target was a 
personal record compilation for mobile use you should not accuse people 
lightly of breaking the law when you seemingly don't know what law applies.
This doesn't mean that you have to take any action as it seems you live 
in a country where any private software development already tends to be 
illegal.
To state it again: I'm strictly against illegal copying but what you 
state here is nonsense for a lot of countries.
