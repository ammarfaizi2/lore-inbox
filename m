Subject: [Very-OT] Best Mobo to get for Linux 2.4.x

If you don't want to answer this, then just ignore it, but help would be 
greatly appreciated.

I'm expecting to sell my system soon and then buy a new system.

My current vendor is micropro.com (yes. restricting, but let's just say 
that my dad is paying for it, and this is his current vendor)

Looking for an AMD T-Bird 1.2 GHz.

I need suggestions on which mobo to get.

I'm assuming that there is no support for the ALi MAGiK1, so my options 
are limited to the VIA KT{133,266}or the AMD 760, and unfortunately as 
of today, my vendor doesn't have any mobos w/ the KT266.

Oh well, that's life.

As I can only use one vendor, and _can_ customize but not build my own 
from scratch, I have only a few options.

DDR
IWill KA266
Asus A7A266

straight 266FSB
IWill KK266-PLUS
Abit KT7A
Asus A7V-133

TIA
Adam
