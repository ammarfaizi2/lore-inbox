We write kernel code in ASCII because of patches in e-mail. When a patch
is saved (often by a script), it is divorced of the encoding in which
e-mail was done. Forwarding of patches then causes them to fail to apply.
Everything else can be worked around.

In my experience, the most common case of such patch rejects has to do
with a European using a non-UTF-8 encoding for his name, rather than
with the copyright symbol.
