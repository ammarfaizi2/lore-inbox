Hi to all!

*** PLEASE, respond directly to mauricio@infohit.si (I'm not subscribed)

I have a question about network interface naming in linux 2.4.x or 2.2.x

Is it possible to define a name for each interface instead of having
eth0, eth1 etc?

I'm using a linux box dedicated for routing & filtering and I would like
to have descriptive interface names such as:

public, private, branch etc...

so the output of ifconfig (and all other commands dealing with
interfaces) would be more 'concrete'

Is it possible? How?


Thanks a lot!

mauricio
