Rico & Dan,

Below is the Email that Jim Forster of Serverworks sent to me:

          "We want to enable the Linux community as quickly as possible; we
agree with
            you that it makes business sense to do so.  Given the fact that
our IP is
           our sole product, we cannot release our technical documents to
the world at
            large.  We have been working to create an extract of our
documents to enable
            the Linux community.  As a small company experiencing tremendous
growth, our
            support infrastructure must focus on our existing customers.  At
this time,
            I do not have an estimated release date for the technical
extract.
            ...
            We are continuing our work to enable the Linux community.  Can
you think of
             any alternative methods to enable the Linux community without
exposing
              ourselves?  I'm certainly open to new ideas..."

Jim responded to my Email regarding support for lm-sensor. Granted
Serverworks has
not released any information to the public. But they are planing to extract
certain chipset
information that might be helpful for you. They are also open to idea from
the Linux
community.

After Jim replied, Phil Edelbock from lm-sensor group came up with a good
idea. They
decided to ask Jim for a specific set of information pertaining to the
project. So rather
goes for the whole documentation, they only asked for a small subset. The
idea worked
because Serverworks were able to supply the information quickly.

This could be a good approach in getting information from Serverwork outside
of NDA.
