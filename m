A better translation is:

   the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
                                      ^^^^^^^^
which is from the New International Version.
Certainly it is easy to point to individual instances of evil that are not money
related.

Follow the URL:
http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+tim+6%3A10&NIV_version=yes&NASB_version=yes&KJV_version=yes&NKJV_version=yes&NIV-IBS_version=yes&RSV_version=yes&DARBY_version=yes&YLT_version=yes&WE_version=yes&showfn=yes&language=english

for a comparison of translations.

And seeing that we are way off topic already....
I would have said that the "core" is probably the one place where
these people aren't evil.  They just have lots of layers of evil
hiding that core.
