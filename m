hi

well i am using linux 9.0 kernel 2.4 ver. 128 Mb RAM

i have seen not only on this sytem but the other one
having 512 Mb RAM the most of the memory is lost or
taken by graphics or xserver. on my system around 90%
is occupied by the xsever and on the sys with 512 Mb
RAM around 70% is occupied. how to reduce this load. i
oculd not get any article or stuff relate to this . if
we can do something in kernel or in some way reduce
this load while working in GUI envt

thanks

Ankit
