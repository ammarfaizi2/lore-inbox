Hi,

I was wondering if there is a way to make the boot-process look 
StarWars-like:


   		lalallaal
  	llalalallalalalalalalalalala
lalalalalalalaalallalalalalalalalallala

and let it scroll up the screen. I would think that this could be done 
with the Framebuffer-Device. Maybe something like fblogo or so.

Thanks,
Niels

Through me you pass into the city of woe:
Through me you pass into eternal pain:
Through me among the people lost for aye.
Justice the founder of my fabric moved:
To rear me was the task of Power divine,
Supremest Wisdom, and primeval Love.
Before me things create were none, save things
Eternal, and eternal I endure.
All hope abandon, ye who enter here.
