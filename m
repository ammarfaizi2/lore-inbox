	Oh, but you missed the mark!  Think Windows XP.  Now there's
the ticket.  If you aren't a Windows XP certified driver, they can
just wipe your driver right off the face of the system...  All in the
name of "stability" (as they define it).  None of this nonsense of
merely flagging if their OS has a non-sanctified driver like Linux.
Linux lets the driver load and run, it merely lets people KNOW that
it's an un-sanctified driver when shit catches fire and burns.  You
know MS.  MS thinks Linux is just a bunch of whimps.  Screw just letting
the user know AFTER something burps and burns.  That's TOO complicated
for a user to figure out and MS has to be "user friendly".  MS is for
men with balls (and no brains)...  Just burn the driver BEFORE it has
a chance to run.  Yeah!  That's the ticket!

	Ooopppsss...  Wait a minute.  That's what the original poster
was falsely complaining about Linux.  Guess he has a bigger case of
optical rectitus that was apparent in his original, obvious, troll.
