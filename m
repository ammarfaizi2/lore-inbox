Nearly all of your base system except the kernel is GNU. Primarily, 
fileutils, sh-utils, and findutils come to mind. These could be replaced, 
in which case it would no longer be GNU/Linux. As long as your standard 
base system tools (chown, cp, dir, dd, df, du, ls, ln, mkdir, mv, rm, 
rmdir, touch, chmod, id, kill, whoami, chroot, who, date, echo, 
pwd, uname, and many others) are GNU, it's really GNU/Linux.
