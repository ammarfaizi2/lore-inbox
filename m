Hear, hear!  I'm still smarting over buying a copy of Wordperfect 8 
for linux for $65 back in '98 or '99, only to find it wouldn't even 
install if it didn't find some old, buggy 2.2.x kernel to run under.
The 2.4.x family was by then several generations old.

Shennanigans like that, screwing the customer (who had no recourse but 
to seriously downgrade his system, no refunds were given) was one of 
the things that Corel was very good at.  And it no doubt heavily 
contributed to the eventual failure of Corel.  Potential Future 
Customers remember that even if the PHB's can't.  I removed my self 
from that PFC list forthwith.

I keep it on the shelf as a reminder that I was one of those "Suckers 
born every minute" :(

I'm for it, if it doesn't work with the latest stable kernel release, 
the labels MUST COME OFF.  But howto enforce that legally is the real 
$64 question.  Humm, I guess that dates me, I can remember that radio 
program.  From back in the '40's.
