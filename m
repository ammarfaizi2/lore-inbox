There is a new version at http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/lc/lc-0.2.tar.gz,
this version also works with qt2.x.
So far I hadn't very much feedback. What's up? Is everyone suddenly
completely happy with cml2? Now is your chance to evaluate the
alternatives or does this require too much work before you can start
flaming?

bye, Roman
