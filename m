To the Dev list:
    First, thanks for all the work on the kernel. I try to keep up with 
the list via both KernelTrap and  Kerneltraffic. Today I just saw the 
discussion on the new development model.  As an end use of the vanilla 
tree, I would like to point out that a large number of people and 
projects rely on the vanilla kernel to be the stable tree do to the 
overly varied and random patching nature of vendor supplied kernels 
making them hard to call reliable. In the case of my preferred distro 
Slackware,  the distro itself expects the vanilla tree to be stable and 
reliable enough to not need any patches.  I believe this is the case for 
a large number off distro' s and end users. Thank you for your time. 
Please send any flames,comments, or complaints via CC, as I am not 
sucribed to the list.
       Evan Hisey
