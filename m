Its a trivial patch and there is a lot to be said for UTF-8 scripts. As
to writing code in ascii, the kernel regularly has outbreaks of either
UTF-8 or ISO-8859-* especially in the docs directory. Standardising
these on UTF-8 would be helpful.

Yes the kernel code is C so ASCII except for the odd abuser of the Â©
symbol.
