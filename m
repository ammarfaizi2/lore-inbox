It was you who wrongly said:
"With KLive I can attempt to estimate market share of _kernel_ code"

Hadn't you read your own disclaimer?

Possibly wrong conclusions about the general market share based on data 
not having the quality for being the basis of such statements are worse 
than having no data.

Every time someone will repeat the "1:5 ratio for reiser4:ext3 users", 
this will be an additional proof it's really worse than no data.
