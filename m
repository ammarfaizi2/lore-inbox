   No, infact what you are suggesting is absolutely not what you should
   do - the postmasters are already overworked, and don't need to be
   troubled as a first resort.
   
   Please, read the FAQ.  If you wish to embarrase yourself on this
   mailing list, that is up to you, but please do not make me look
   stupid, AND THERE IS NO NEED TO SHOUT YOUR INCORRECT ADVICE.

I am one of the postmasters at vger.  Maybe you don't realize
that.
