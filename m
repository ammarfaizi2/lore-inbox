I tried to compile 2.4.14 and successfully detect the digital 21143 network
card, however, i can't ping out

this is just a curiosity, because it works with my 2.2.17 kernel

the reason why i didn't move to 2.4.x yet because i got this problem with
2.4.5 as well and gave it a try again on 2.4.14 kernel

anyone know what should i check in the system  other than blaming on the
kernel ?
