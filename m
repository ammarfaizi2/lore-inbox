See my mail to Ingo about most of this. The basic point is you should have 
told me about this earlier, simply ignoring the problem won't make it go 
away. Your annoyance was quite noticable, but this seemed to include my 
complete contribution. You never said what annoyed you, which makes it 
rather hard for me to you to change it into a more acceptable form.

bye, Roman
