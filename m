RMS didn't understand this paragraph, and neither did I.  Would you
please clarify?

If you did this because of RMS or his GPL then I think all of us owe him
a big 'thank you'.

Andre, I've been following this list for at least two years.  Although I
contribute nothing except an occasional bug report I care about what
happens here and I and I care about the people who do contribute.  I know
that includes you -- in a big way.

Please let me make some observations:

1) I admire anyone who speaks more than one language.  I suspect that
    includes you.

2) Much of the time I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
    (I'll bet you a Porsche that I'm not the only one ;-)

3) You'll make back your expenses a lot faster if you'll get rid of
    the Porsche.

4) I thank you for all your contributions to Open Source.  I benefit
    from your work every day and I want you to know that I appreciate it.
