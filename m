Sure.  All it takes if someone want to hit a antivirus company then is
to
pay someone else to hold the copyright and take the blame for the virus
damage.
Possible, considering how people have paid others to do their jail time
for them.

The antivirus comany might not be able to distribute the "illegal"
virus scanning software while tied up in court, letting the virus hit
hard.  Could be interesting to watch. :-/
