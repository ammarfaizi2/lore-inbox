Without them we do _NOT_ calm the flamewar against Linux's 2.4 VM.
Second, it is time for the outstanding ReiserFS patches.
If we are somewhat risky we put Ingo's GREAT O(1)-scheduler in, too.
Preemption is than another story.

Thank you for any feedback in advance.
This not intended as a flamewar start.
