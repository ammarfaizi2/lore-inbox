Hi,

I have updated dontdiff in the usual place:

  http://www.moses.uklinux.net/patches/dontdiff

for the 2.6 kernels. Obviously this was only tested on my configuration(s)
so any additions are welcome. Just email them to me and I will add them.

For those who don't know what "dontdiff" is --- grep the file:

/usr/src/linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

Regards
Tigran
