Subject: 2.4.18 NAT Problems with udp packets; kernel doesnt care about changed rules

Hi,

I have a Linux Box configured as Router for my Network. Behind my Network
are several Win/Mac/Linux Clients. Today I tried to play Dungeon Siege (DS)
on my Notebook (WinXP) which is behind my router with my friend.
so the connection looks like the following (did tcpdump, dont have the
actual data available though):
myNotebook.2302 -> myRouter.someport
myRouter.2302 -> Friend.6073 udp blah blah
Friend.6073 -> myRouter.2302 udp blah blah
myRouter.2302 -> Friend.6073 icmp udp port 2302 unreachable

the following line in my fw script does masquerading:
$FILTER = /sbin/iptables
$EXTINT = ppp0 (most of the time, but it happened under 2.2.x that the
kernel went crazy and started naming them ppp0 ppp1 ppp2 ppp3..., hasnt
happened in a while)
$FILTER -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXTINT -j MASQUERADE

Playing DS over the internet ONLY works with this line added (10.0.1.20 is
my notebook):
$FILTER -t nat -A PREROUTING -i $EXTINT -p udp -d $EXTIP --dport
2300:2400 -j DNAT --to 10.0.1.20
no else changes need to be made

And here comes the next trouble. Flushing all rules and loading again all my
previous rules + this new one did not change a thing! I had to disconnect
from the internet for some seconds and then reconnect and load the script
again. Only then did the kernel get the changes and route correctly. If I
just flushed the rules and reloaded them, the kernel gives a damn about it
and ignores the new rules. For example I had udp 2300:2400 directed to
10.0.1.50. I changed it in the script (so that it directs them to 10.0.1.20)
and reloaded it. Still on tcpdump I could see that the packets went to
10.0.1.50 and not 10.0.1.20 where they should be going now!

Please, as I am not subscribed to the Linux Kernel Mailinglist, add my email
to cc when replying. Thanks.

Thanks for reading,
Andreas
