When I took all those BSD executables and ported them to linux-0.99
so that we had a more complete tool chain than what was in the
Yggdrasil 75-floppy-disk distribution that I started with, GNU
provided the compiler tool-chain and an unbelievably-complicated
editor called Emacs. Fortunately, there was an early version of
vi included with the distribution. Incidentally, it was later
learned that it __was__ vi, so a completely different editor
with vi-like commands (vim) was eventually written.

I used vi to modify all the 'C' source-files from BSD so they
would compile with the new compiler. The resulting ported
source was sent back using snail-mail to become part of the
next distributions. I was not alone in this undertaking.
There were at least 10 persons, mostly college students,
involved in this undertaking.

None of this stuff involved GNU at all. And, no, we did
not remove the BSD license message from the source.

GNU just provided some tools. Some tools were pretty good
and some were very bad.

Many years later when I first saw the text, GNU/Linux I vomited,
literally. If you build a house, you certainly don't name it
after the company that made the hammer. For some reason,
somebody called Richard Stallman started to brag that he
was the developer of the "GNU/Linux operating system". He
got away with it! Nobody called him to task. It seems that
nobody except me even complained. So now you are stuck.

He invents some new "license" and expects his subjects to
use it!  Tell him to go pound sand. Tell him to get off
the developer's backs and go away. We don't need him.


Cheers,
Dick Johnson
