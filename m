I tried to install RH 7.0 on a new box this
week-end:

	Motherboard MSI 648 Max
	CPU Intel P4 2.8 GHz
	Memory 1024 MB PC-333 DDR

It doesn't boot far enough to get any diagnostic
information. It stops.  I drove the 40 miles to
civilization and retrieved a "boot anything" floppy
which presumes everything is no smarter than a
'486. The machine boots. The machine also boots
and runs Windows/2000 professional with no problems.

So... has anybody else had problems with this chip-set/CPU
combination? I'm currently "making" a distribution here
at work, from an already-installed 7.0 on another machine.
I'm sure this will work because it, too, only presumes
a '486. So, any suggestions?

Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
