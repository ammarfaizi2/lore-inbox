Yes, the "software as such patent" and/or "trivial patent" disease
spreaded the last decades - not only in USPTO-land (and identically in
JPO-land) but also basically illegally in EPO-land.
And it is probably much simpler to "prove" (in the law sense, not
technically/mathematically) a patent infringement if you have C source
of the driver instead of some undocumented blob of object code.
