These are differences between Debian the project and Debian the
distribution. non-free is not a part of the distribtion and never has
been. The Debian project has always had people who are willing to
package up a few non-free bits of software. The FSF did not have a
problem with that at all if those were put on a different server
(ie not visible on ftp.debian.org but on non-free.debian.org for
example).

It is the goal of a vocal minority of people within Debian, but the
project as a whole has not set that as a goal at all. This has also
nothing to do with lock-in at all.

At any rate, this discussion is now officially off-topic for lkml so
lets stop it.
