In general, maybe. In software business I think the world is moving
towards making money out of services rather than IP.

On another perspective, something which is often underestimated is the
fact that the cost of copying software (programs, music etc.) has no
relation whatsoever with the "value" of the software itself. This is
not a permit to copy -- it is an observation about the properties of
software in general. This is a very strong property and I think that
any attempt to resist this "law of nature" will ultimately be futile.
