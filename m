Agreed

This is how you spot a lawyer from a normal human. The human agrees but
the lawyer says "but what about my dentist, will he really want me to
drill his teeth" ;)

The intent is clear by any view for current code, and the past is for

Its the job of some of them to worry. After all many of them have
shareholders to answer for, and whether they worry about misusing your

so don't underestimate your smart planning in advance ;)
