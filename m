Hey Dean!

Not a problem, I forgot all about it.
If this is in part for the "eudoramail.com" 550 REJECT, I was getting spam
from "eudoramail.com" so I blanket killed the domain from my mailer.

I think I owe an apology to you and the list also for not maintaining
civility and going to the straight kill to action.  If we (me included)
did not learn from mistakes, then there would be issues.  I have no hard
feelings towards you or your company, it is all cool ;-)

It took you less time than me to learn this lesson, and everyone
(including Linus) has forgiven me for my jerkself in the past.  I am sure
everyone will forgive you too, as I have.  Hey it is only software and
money, I just had an angioplasty less than 24 hours ago.  The important
things are now REAL clear to me in life.

Getting upset will only get shaved like a sheep (cardiogram sticky pads),
stuck like a pig (blood work), and blown up like a balloon (angioplasty).
Then all people think of you as a BOHA, Bag Of Hot Air, and hope you float
away.

Dean, just mellow and go with it and try to do the right thing.  There are
way to many people doing the wrong thing.

Cheers and Happy Keyboarding!
