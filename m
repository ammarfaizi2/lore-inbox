Hello,

I am writing to you to request your help in a very disturbing case of a=
n 11 year old girl who is fighting for her life.

Four years ago, Lavinia Velman was returning home from the kindergarten=
 when she was hit by a car.
The recovery was hard and at one time her life depended on a breathing =
machine in a hospital.
On 24th of December 2003, Lavinia received as donation a semi-portable =
breathing machine she could use at home.
Lavinia's life had begun to return to normal. She could move her hands =
and could stay without the breathing machine for up to 10 hours.

A new tragedy struck in October last year when an electricity black out=
 caused Lavinia's breathing machine to stop.
The black out lasted for a few hours, so long that even the breathing m=
achine's batteries ran out.
The child panicked and went into cardiac arrest. The medics were very s=
keptical regarding her chances of survival.

Now the only solution is an operation in a hospital in the UK (Cromwell=
 Hospital, London).
The costs for the transport and operation are around =A330,000.
Lavinia's family lives in Sofia, Bulgaria. They are quite poor and have=
 been able to gather only a small part of that amount.
Please make a donation to support Lavinia and her grief torn family. Pl=
ease help her in her fight to survive.

Your donation, whatever the amount, is greatly appreciated and can make=
 a difference.


Donations can be made via check or money order to:=20

Please make checks payable to: VICTOR VELMAN .


Thank you very much in advance!
Silvia and Bill Durham, trying to support a worthy cause
