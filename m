Hi everybody,

I hope this is not too off-topic, but the fact is that neither the Intel
PRO/Wireless 2100 (Centrino) chipset nor the Broadcom BCM9430x (e.g.
Dell Truemobile 1180/1300/1400) chipset is currently supported in Linux
due to FCC regulation problems.

Anyhow, I plan to get a new Notebook within the next 2 or 3 weeks and I
need to decide, whether to go for the Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 or the
Broadcom BCM9430x chipset. I know it's hard to say, but what do you
think, which company (Intel or Broadcom) is more likely to release the
necessary documents and/or drivers for their chipsets? Both companys
seem to ignore all inquiries concerning Linux support at the moment.

While we're at it, are there any news from the WLAN front?

Thank you!

Marc
