Perhaps you should take a bit more time to go
over the facts.  The 
columnist obviously didn't.  Of course, it's very
easy to make an opinion 
of something without providing a source for the
basis of your opinion.
 The BugTraq website even says at the top of its
stat page, that 
vulnerabilities for programs such as Internet
Exlporer and Outlook are not 
counted in Windows vulnerabilities, while the
Linux vulnerabilities 
encompass all the software available with a
distribution, a lot of which 
is not running from a standard workstation
installation.
  The mailing list you sent your e-mail to is a
developers list for the 
core of Linux, and has little to do with
distributions.  If you feel like 
sticking your nose somewhere, try it on usenet.
