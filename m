Very interesting.  It'd be interesting to see if they are able to do 
this and get past the GPL.  However, even if they are selling "Sys V" 
or "Unixware" licenses, it doesn't mean that they have the right to 
sell Linux licenses.

To put it simply, just because they "may,"  - and I say may here simply 
because we have no evidence to prove their claims but cannot flatly 
deny them - own the rights to Sys V, does NOT mean they own the right 
to the code that was released under GPL and does NOT give them the 
right to reassign a license to it.

If I were a lawyer for the FSF, I'd take this opportunity to 
investigate how they are selling the licenses, and go smash them up...
