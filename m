Sadly, I can't share my prescriptions... But they're on file at the
pharmacy:
	Zyprexa, for psychosis (calming effect, "major tranquilizer") 
	Topamax (mood stabilizer, and weight control)
	Neurontin (mood stabilizer)
	Klonopin (anti-anxiety, "minor tranquilizer")

Klonopin can be addictive (controlled substance), and has even been
reported in the news as a date rape drug because of how effective it
is.
