IBM DeathStar 75gxp.

One of the worst hard drives ever made.  It's quite likely it's failed,
and in fact, two years is pretty impressive out of one of these.

Make backups immediately.  Run ibm's DFT tool, get the code to RMA this
thing back to IBM.  Sell the replacement they send you to a sucker on
eBAY, and buy yourself a new drive.  You can pickup 80 gig drives for
around 80 bucks nowadays.  I used to recommend Maxtors, until they said
they're cutting their warranty to one year from three.  I don't know what
to use anymore.

Mike
