 The ingredients in Fatblaster assist in the thermogenic processes allowing you to naturally and safely burn fat and loose unwanted weight. Fuel for this increased metabolic rate can be provided by stored body fat.  One is by reducing food intake or food absorption and the other is by enhancing energy expenditure.
