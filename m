Some people may be able to get more than one. A year or two
back a peniless friend of mine built quite a nice environment
for himself with two 486 boxes and a pile of SPARC IIs.

Also, there are server applications that don't need much. For
example, a firewall and NAT box for an ADSL line, or a print
spooler or ...

You could even build a Beowulf out of such machines
