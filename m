Andre Hedrick,SuSe  -- the past.

Andre Hedrick, Self Funded.

I am one of the few who have tried to make a business model out of
selling services which strictly promote open source.  Contracts where it
is all or nothing and they still have to pay.  The services are to write
only opensource drivers for contract.  Well that day is coming to an end,
and not by my choice.

If you want the decenting view, I may be your poster child.
