All this is fine and dandy, but saying "My code is better than yours!!" sti=
ll=20
doesn't solve the issue this thread hopes to achieve, that being "I'd like =
to=20
get reiser4 into the kernel".  There seems to be a lot of (historical?)=20
tension present here, but all that seems to be doing is making things worse=
=2E =20
PLEASE keep this thing a tad on par.  Keeping this up is hurting everyone=20
more than helping.  I wish I could say something as simple as "let's just b=
e=20
friends", but that's saying a lot.  I can say this though: this is open=20
source, and that means that our source is open, and we should be too.
