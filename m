Hi!

I just installed 2.4.5-ac6 (from 2.4.5). I needed the ac kernel to fix my VIA timer bug.

Now, my Intellimouse Explorer (USB) seems to have problems. It doesn't go smooth anymore. when i move the mouse slowly, it does not continually go on the screen. sometimes it stops for some time, just like a dirty ball mouse (mine is an optical one).

is there something wrong with the ac kernels?

- Jonas.
