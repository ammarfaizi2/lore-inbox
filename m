A sysctl would be a lot nicer for distributions, as one could ship a
standard nosound setup and letting people enable it in rc.sysctl or
whatever.  This would save you from hearing the clueless users who just
installed linux (RH 7.2 :) for the first time going *beep* *beep* *beep*
for hours.

For people who compile their own kernels, a compile time option should
be quite enough, though.
