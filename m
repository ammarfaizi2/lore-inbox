Hi!

Bitkeeper distribution contains stuff from GNU diffutils (copyrighted
by FSF and GPL), yet bitkeeper docs does not mention its GPL-ed, and
does not contain pointer to the sources. [I pointed couple other
issues.]

Larry's attitude is "you should shut up and be glad you may use this
for free" and "sue me to get GPL issues fixed". Then, he tried to
punish me for pointing at those mistakes by withdrawing installer from
GPL.

Nice attitude, I'd suggest you to stay away from
bittrojan^Wbitkeeper. If you still think bitkeeper is good thing (tm),
look at http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/bitkeeper.txt. [Sorry
for slightly strange ordering of mails. You should be able to open it
in mutt to see threads correctly.]
