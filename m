I have several megs more of patches for Linus / Alan pending and this would
also be part of them.  Just to avoid driving Linus & Alan completly into
insanity I have to chop them into chunks of sane size and until I've fed
the last bits to them there will be such inconsistences.

Since three-way merges are quite a bit more time consuming I'd appreciate
if any MIPS-related patches would not be fed directly to Linus or Alan but
through me or anybody else with writeaccess to the Linux/MIPS CVS archive.

Thanks,

  Ralf
