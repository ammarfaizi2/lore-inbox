Does it always happen when you are moving the mouse over a button or
windowbar or some other on-screen object like that?

Usually, when I have that happen, it's because I'm overclocking the
machine too much... I have no idea if that helps, but I thought I'd go
ahead and throw in my two cents, just in case it does.
