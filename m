Just to say I got the Intel 7205 Chipset motherboard and everything is 
going fine - lightning fast in fact.

Still a message about Unknown bridge resource and something about device 
00:1f.1 not available becuase of resource collisions but as everything I 
want to use seems to work presumably it doesn't matter. I disabled all 
the stuff I'm not using at the moment such as Firewire. If anyone wants 
the output of lspci give me a shout.

Thanks to all who helped anyhow.
