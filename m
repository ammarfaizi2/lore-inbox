Hello,

I'd like to play with the Capabilities module in LSM, but am not quite
sure where to start. There used to be a userspace tool, lcap, by Spoon;
but development seems to have ceased on this several years ago. Should the
new look CAP have a userspace tool, or is it intended more as a building
block for other security modules?

Cheers,
Pete
