After a stranger than usual late-night #kernelnewbies session on Thursday, I 
was inspired to come up with Kernel Hangman.  This is the traditional game of 
hangman, except that the words you have to guess are kernel symbols.

So, test your knowledge of kernel trivia and play it at 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/hangman
