As everyone knows, Joerg Schilling has a blog, and he often pushes his=20
pro-Solaris agenda, and flames the LKML about how Linux breaks cdrecord=20
(instead of just admitting cdrecord is broken) or how much more awesome=20
Solaris is compared to Linux.

Well, he just fired yet another salvo at the Linux community:=20
http://schily.blogspot.com/2005/04/value-marketing-and-freedom.html

I commented on his blog entry, but I am afraid of being censored as my view=
s=20
do not align with his, so I am including the text of my comment here:

////
I suggest people don't read too much into what Schily says. He thinks Solar=
is=20
is this almighty perfect operating system that crushes all others: The reas=
on=20
Solaris is failing is because more and more people are switching to other=20
operating systems. And yes, Linux just happens to be the one that most are=
=20
switching to; BSD and QNX are also other choices.

Most of the people switching to Linux are not doing so because its GPL, not=
=20
because its associated with other Free Software, and not because the source=
=20
is available. They are switching simply because it is the best product out=
=20
there at this time; and as I see it, it will continue to be the best produc=
t=20
because Linux software developers are not sitting around arguing about what=
=20
license is better, or what features other operating systems have or don't=20
have.

Linux developers code, OpenSolaris developers sit around and flame Linux=20
developers instead of coding. Which operating system would _you_ choose?
