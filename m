Hi

Sorry - lost the topic of the email.

Anyways, i am currently running the 5328 version of the NVidia drivers 
(pre-patched).

Thank you all for your patience and help. 

How was it resolved? I formated and started from scratch. Not elegant, but it 
worked. Dunno what the real problem was, but it's over and my card is 
working ... Hurrah ...
