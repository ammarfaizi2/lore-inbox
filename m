for which card (chip), is the modification of mpu401 necessary?
if it's only for the cs4232 (on-board?) above, then we can make a
new top-level module, such like snd-pc98-somewhat, which uses the
cs4231 lowlevel module without isapnp stuff, and the modified mpu401
routines, so that the original cs4231 and mpu401 are not changed too
much.

even if cs4231 low-level routines must be changed for pc98, we can
pass the hardware-type CS4231_HW_PC98 in snd_cs4231_create(), and as
Alan suggested, the pc98-specific codes run on this condition.

although this is true for mpu401, the large initialization-code found
in the last patch is definitely not for the "common" module like
mpu401_uart.c.  such a thing should go into the device-specific
module.
since both cs4231 and mpu401_uart are shared among veraious drivers,
changing such a common module results in breakage of other drivers.
(please note that even some pci drivers use mpu401 low-level module.)

or, the change for mpu401 is always necessary on PC9800 regardless of
which device is used?


ciao,

Takashi
