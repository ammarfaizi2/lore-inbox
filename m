Again I find your terminology at odds with mine; what do you mean by
forking the tree? I get the impression that it's a very restrictive notion
where any functional ehancement applied as a patch on top of a standard
distribution kernel is considered by you as forking? Is that so? (And BTW
by patch I mean input to the patch command.)
