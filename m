Greetings,

I have upgraded to 2.6.5 from 2.6.4 after which I have no console display.  I 
have used my 2.6.4 .config (which worked fine) to configure 2.6.5.  I have 
all the usual settings compiled into the kernel for virtual terminals and 
such to work.  Is there any options at all that I might somehow be missing?  
Are there any new options I need that were introduced in 2.6.5?  I really 
want to get this sorted out.

Thank you all for your time and help.

Regards,
Jason Harrison
