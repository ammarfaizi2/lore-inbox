I'm very sorry. I could have sworn you had said something along the
lines of 'Some day I want to put version control into reiser, which
could technically be considered a competitor to bitkeeper. I have a lot
of other things to do with reiserfs as well so I'll do those first'. But
when I went back through the list, I couldn't find it. 

The closest to that I could find was the following:

I must have gotten the issues involved with reiserfs confused with
another project.

Again, I'm sorry I got your position wrong.
