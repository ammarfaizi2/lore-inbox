Indeed.  They've been very successful so far in getting people to
  pony up (pay) for beta software (see W2K: The Beta, Whistler/XP: The
  Beta, and (I am pretty sure) VisualStudio.Net: The Beta.)
Interesting concept.  Quite an evil marketing scheme, if you ask me.
  The users pay to help Microsoft debug their software, and also pay
  to put their security (both in the cracking and data safety senses)
  on the line.
Huzzah!  Microsoft has proven it: we're sheep!

                              Baaa baa baa baaa,
                              Joseph
