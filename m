No, I was not talking about FUSD, just uinput driver that is in kernel
proper. Take a look at this:

	http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/inputpipe/

It allows making input devices "network-transparent" and for example
use joystick physically connected to one box to play game on another.
Hmm, actually it is almost what you need, you just need modify server
to multiplex events into single device instead of creating separate
input devices.

No, I think you will still have the same issues with locking, unfortunately
I can't commint on a specific date when they will be resolved. Patches are
always welcome of course.
