Subject: Can I have a serial display output and a kbd PS/2 input?

Sorry to be insistent in this point, but perhaps requesting the problem this
way someone figures out what I am trying to do.
The display is already configured and sending getty line from inittab waits
for an input from serial so it doesn't work.
Any other ideas? This is my last try.

Thanks in advance
Frank again.
