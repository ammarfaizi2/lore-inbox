Yesssss ...  but how?  (drums fingers)

But wait, what am I thinking?  Am I sliding down the 
slipperly slope of crime so quickly?  This is how Osama
Bin Laden got started you know: with a pirated copy of
DOS 3.2 on his old Osborne.  It wasn't too long after
that that he was first seen in the company of Bert.

I think what I'll do is send out a GPL.  I've been told
it's a destroyer of intellectual property, so maybe it
will erase your memory that they have seen these messages.

GPL GPL GPL
