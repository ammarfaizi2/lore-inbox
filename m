Linus, Andrea, thank you for your comments!

I don't test for the multiple device with direct IO under current
kernel..., I keep it in mind.

Thanks Marcelo for including my patch :)

I, however, found another problem.
Accessing with inode size unit (== 4096 byte) is ok, but if I accessed
with block size unit, generic_direct_IO() returns error.  The reason
is that blocksize is designated as inode->i_blkbits, and its value is
not disk minimal block size (512), but inode's unit size (4096).

Patch is here. If inode is S_ISBLK and is not mounted, then blocksize
is set as hardsect_size. This implementation needs some computational
cost, but I think it can be ignored. This patch works well for me.

The current problem is that is_mounted() checking is worked for
/dev/sda1 (partition area) only, not for /dev/sda (total disk area),
if /dev/sda1 is mounted. This problem is also existed in /dev/raw
interface, but I think it's not important issue (should I fix it?)

Thanks,
