First of all, tell that ti the IT managers, they are the ones you need
to convince.  I believe that I have faithfully and accurately relayed
what I've learned from them.

Second, the point you are missing, on purpose? is that with a pure
open source play there is no barrier to entry for anyone else, they
can take your source and sell it under the same terms.  There is a
reason that the VC's want to know what you have that noone else has
and how you are going to keep them from getting it.  Hate VC's all
you want, they still have a point.

You're welcome to rant and rave about how wrong all this is, but they
are well established basic business principles and your ranting isn't
going to change them, it's going to take something more substantial
to do that.  If you want to change them, start with talking to the
business folks, not me.
