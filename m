Err, and if I to argue for it then I'm not?  That's easy I argue for it.
Do you think the jfs team will object?

Anyway, that was not serious, I will not argue for the removal of
information on how to use CVS, and gpl'd tool, from the tree.  Even though
I think the tree would be better off without it.  This is not an issue.
A steady slide toward proprietary tools and behind-the-scenes development
in cathedral-style is an issue.  This is not the Linux I knew, or thought
I knew, it is more like FreeBSD.
