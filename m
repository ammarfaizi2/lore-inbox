About the devfs patch.

Yes, I already reported it a long time ago -
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0306.2/1655.html
and have no idea why it hasn't been merged in 2.4, after all
it's supposed to fix some things and there have been no changes
since then in the kernel.

Can someone clarify this ? I've been applying this patch since
its release and it didn't broke anything.
