Linux shouldn;t move to the GPL3 for the very reason that the DRM
restrictions would make linux incompatible with soon to be released
displays.  Also Nvidia and such would not be  able to make binary
drivers available.
Copyright for one work is set forward in law.  My view is that Artists
and their sponsors deserve
the right to prevent piracy.  In my view the Open Source Community
have an incompatible attitude.  In my mind the buying of a DVD means
that I watch it on DVD players be it on my computer or on the TV. 
while I beleive that I should be able to watch my DVDs on a linux
based system, it behooves the open source community to support it in a
legal way.  Cracking Access Control Sytems might be fun, but it only
generates huge controversy in concerned industries.  An Open Source
Access Control System that is respected by the FOSS community would be
a great diplomatic way to allow for more access to content.  My
personal view is that copying for my own personal use is ok, however
the converting of such material in a way not granted to me by the
Creator is not ethical.  Richard Stallman is painting himself into a
corner in this way.

Hence:
     The GNU/Linux community needs to work with the MPAA, RIAA and
other DRM players and work to support basic restrictions on copying
content while preserving the Creator/Companies right to sustain their
works.

Thankyou
