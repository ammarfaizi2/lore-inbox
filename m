Hello

I faintly remember reading some article on the Net from Linus Torvalds stating
something like if a piece of code is written specifically for Linux kernel, it
must be under GPL.

I have got an nVidia NForce2 board and downloaded their Ethernet driver (nvnet)
and they say in README: "the network driver provided by NVIDIA is subject to
the NVIDIA software license". How is with compatibility of such a behaviour
with GPL of the kernel sources?
