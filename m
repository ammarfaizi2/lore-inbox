I wonder if perhaps the solution should be that the GPLv3 draft should
be renamed to something else to allow RMS to create his new license that
does exactly what he wants it to do, without hijacking existing GPLv2
code using a license that in many people's opinion is NOT in the spirit
of the GPLv2 (which it could be argued overrides the "or later" part of
the license).  The current GPLv3 draft may be in the spirit of what RMS
intended the GPLv2 to be, but it isn't in the spirit of what the GPLv2
says and does.

No one has a problem with people making new licenses.  People have a
problem with people making new licenses and wanting to retroactively
replace existing licenses with a new and very different license.

Now what would be a good name for the GPLv3?  GRLv1 (GNU Restricted
License v1) perhaps. :)  That is essentially what it is doing.
Restricting what you can do with the code.
