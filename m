Almost spot-on.

Where it's off is

- It's not ALL about reimplenting.  Didn't Solaris' prstat come AFTER top?
  Anyway I'm sure there are lots of examples here, maybe not LARGE pieces
  of code (although I'll point to TeX since every exception needs an
  exception as well), but I think you discount open source innovation
  too much.  All of the ATTENTION is on the bits that are reimplementations
  because that's how mass markets work.

- Just because two people independenty implement something doesn't mean
  one of them is REimplementing.

Isn't bk simply a reimplementation of p4 by your argument?
