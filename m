Dear Sir,

I am the younger brother of the former military leader in Sierra leone.Major 
  Johnnypaul Koroma.During his brief tenure in office he used his office to  
involve in good mining operations in Gold and diamonds,and he was able to  
accummulate about 12,000 carats of Diamonds and 2,000 kilos of Gold.,with  
the total estimated value of  USD20,000,000 (twenty million
dollars).Unfortunately he has been declared wanted by the special court in  
Sierra leone,but he is nowhere to be found.We have therefore decided to find 
  reliable buyers or agents who will help us to sell these goods and use the 
  money to open accounts in Europe or USA and invest in good business and  
purchase houses.We have decided to offer 20% of the total sales to an
honest person who will help us to sell these goods.
Upon your respounse to this mail i will attach in my second  mail the photos 
  of the Gold and diamonds.We will appreciate it if you will handle this  
business confidentially.
Please reply me immediately for more details.

Yours sincerely,
karim koroma
