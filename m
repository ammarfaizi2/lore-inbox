Everyone scratches their own itches - and if a vendor doesn't *become*
a member of the community, including understanding the ground rules, the
motivators and de-motivators, and does not become an advocate for those
community goals, they will always be on the outside looking in.
Being a member of the community can cost you your vendor soul.  I really
like the phrasing that Andrew used in his keynote at OLS last year.
Reread this and think hard about it:

http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ols-2004.txt

In particular, I think this portion is key:

	Well, I think a similar process is coming into play as corporate
	programmers are assigned to sit in their cubicles and work on
	Linux.	They come in as good little corporate people but some
	of them are subverted.	We end up taking over their brains
	and owning them.  They become members "of the community".
	They become Free software developers.

While this is a statement of what is happening, I think it is also an
important statement about what needs to happen for the RT community to
become part of the mainline development community.  Until you have been
subverted, you are going to keep talking about how to advocate *your*
agenda.  You need to advocate the *communities'* agenda, as a member of
the subverted community who holds onto *all* of the major driving forces
and goals for Linux.

It's easy:

	1) Change your allegiance to Linux first
	2) Do the right thing.

And, implicit in that is that I believe that RT for the community will
in the long term be The Right Thing.
