	If I had to purchase a motherboard and graphics card for a
	desktop that were running Linux, which ones should I be
	buying? Are AMD's chipsets better than those made by VIA? And
	what about ATI's cards?

P.S.: I have an Asus A7V/VIA KT133 boarch here with a Matrox G400 card
and I wish the performance were better (especially when I'm playing a
DVD). At least, when I'm using the Promise IDE interface and ignore
the IDE interface supplied by the southbridge, Linux feels faster.
