	I am skeptical of any claim that "there are really only two
conclusions you can draw from this" if those conclusions are not of
the form "x" and "not x" (and conclusions of that form don't need to
be predicated on anything to begin with), at least without an
explanation that all other conclusions are impossible.

	I'm not a lawyer, so please don't rely on my layman's opinion
here as legal advice.

	In the Hustler v. Moral Majority case, I believe that the
purpose for which the copying was being done may also have been
relevant in establishing that it was fair use.  The copying was being
done to discuss what Hustler had written, even if it was also being
done to raise money.  I assume that this was also the case with
whatever email Pavel had posted.

	In comparison, if you violate the GPL, by, say, producing a
proprietary compiler comprising substantial amounts GCC source code, I
don't see how that action would qualify as fair use to begin with.
So, I would think that if the copyrights were registered with a form
TX from the copyright office, that one could recover statutory damages
($25k per infringement?) even if there were no provable "actual"
damages.

	Secondarily, it's also worth noting that there is potentially
a market for GPL exceptions.
