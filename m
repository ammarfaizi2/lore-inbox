	Not today, but perhaps in a few dozen years. What can be done with FPGAs 
today is already pretty amazing.

	The video card is not nVidia's entire product. The software that comes with 
it and the support they provide is also part of that product.

	The performance you get from the video card is the product. Just a new 
driver version can sometimes provide markedly improved performance. So nVidia 
is probably doing things in their driver that could also speed up other 
people's graphics cards.

	That's a more reasonable argument. I accept the possibility that nVidia's 
drivers  may contain huge amounts of investment that they don't want to let 
out to help their competition. Fine, keep the drivers closed source. Just 
tell us what the interfaces are and we'll make our own drivers. Maybe they're 
afraid ours will be better. ;)

	I guess they could possibly argue that the interfaces themselves are the 
result of large amounts of work that would significantly benefit their 
competitors. I don't know if that's really the case though.

	By the way, I haven't given up on open source hardware. I think it can be 
done with today's technology and is only becoming more and more possible as 
technology improves.
