Hi All,

	With the recent flurry of inclusions, the trivial@
rustcorp.com.au Trivial Patch Monkey has passed 100 patches which have
filtered into the various kernels: 5 into 2.2, 55 into 2.4 and 71 into
2.5.  Linus and Marcelo now seem well trained to take the patches
(although the bogus attribution is a problem).

	With this surprising success (I thought the damn thing would
die after a few days), I will be continuing to provide the service,
which only takes me about an hour a week.

Usage notes:
	1) Please provide one patch per email, even if it means 50
	   emails.

	2) Make sure your diffs are -p1 compliant, ie:
		+++ linux/drivers/net/foo.c

	3) MIME is fine.

	4) CC'ing trivial is fine: I usually only forward the patch
	   if a kernel has been released since.

	5) I actually read the patches, so don't expect real-time
	   response.

FYI, most patches are: (1) janitorial fixes from new people who can't
get Linus or linux-kernel to read their patches (aka. Alan Cox Mode),
and (2) one-liners from experienced kernel hackers who wouldn't bother
retransmitting themselves (aka. Drop Prevention Mode).

Thanks!
Trivial Patch Monkey.
