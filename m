Maybe I'm an old stick in the mud, but IRC seems like a big waste of
time to me.  It's perfect for off the cuff answers and fairly useless
for thoughtful answers.  We used to write well thought out papers and
specifications for OS work.  These days if you can't do it in a paragraph
on IRC it must not be worth doing, eh?
