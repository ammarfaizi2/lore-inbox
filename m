 From the message that y ou linked to, it would appear that the
RTLinux patent isn't an issue. The letter seems to state that
RTLinux has licensed the patent free to any GPL distribution.
In other words, their patent would only be a costly problem for
a non-GPL system (e.g. Windows or BSD) running under the RT kernel.
