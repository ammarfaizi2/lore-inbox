I think you misunderstood my comment. I wasn't commenting about the thread
above in particular. I'm sure everyone (I definitely do) appreciate your
work and if one of your patches gets dropped in favour of someone else's I'm
sure it's nothing personal.

It is just disappointing to see you get into fights with just about everyone
about the simplest little differences. Sometimes it just does a lot more
good if you show your disagreement in a better tone.
