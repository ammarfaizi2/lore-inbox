I did not made my point clear. You previously said:

Did the 'etc' include 'and wget (or similar app) works fine' ?

Thanks.
Can you check if there is a backup file of the dmesg after boot
in your /var/log (or elsewhere) ? The very first lines of the dmesg
have been cut.Â²

A few more details could help:
- can you reproduce this misbehavior if the fglrx module is never loaded
  after boot ?
- assuming sysrq has no effect (?), are the keyboard leds dead or do they
  still answer after lockup ?
- is the driver able to send/receive more than 64 packets during a simple
  ping (no -i option) ?
