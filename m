i installed debian and a fresh compile of 2.4.25, installed the backports
collection for XF86/gnome2 and all my software i like. it goes fine for a
bit. but then while playing any sound (mainly streaming mp3's and my own
mp3's(in xmms)) the machine would lockup and i would have to reboot. i
never had this problem in windows with the box so i was wondering if
anyone had any incite into this.
