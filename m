This is irelevant.

Your license is illegal in big part of the world. You can just
download bitkeeper and reverse engineer it in order to interoperate
with it, no matter what Larry says; just check your local laws.

To make the analogy: "You can stand on the street, giving people free
Pepsi and telling them they are not allowed to drink Cola if they take
Pepsi from you. And they can safely take Pepsi from you, drink it and
laugh at you." Try it.
