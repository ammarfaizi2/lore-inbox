Linus,

There is one fundamental problem, and nobody has addressed.

Who will enforce the GPL over DRM violations?
Since it is a blanket over the entire kernel, and you have formally
(for the most part) have authorized DRM, thus one assumes you are the only
one who can pursue in a court of law.

Regardless of what I or anyone thinks, this effective places total
copyright to you.  Additionally for you to have a legal position to stand
on, it may be required for one to show you have total authority/assignment
of the entire kernel.

This is only an old man thinking out loud.

Cheers,

Andre Hedrick
