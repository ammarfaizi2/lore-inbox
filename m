But I still think 6 is too small from user level point of view, as
Petter wrote.  The example is /usr/lib library links.  I got bug
report which complained that a library want to use "bounce" link:

	/usr/lib/liba -> /etc/alternatives/liba -> /usr/lib/another/libb.

If .so file uses major.minor scheme, then /usr/lib/liba.so links:

	/usr/lib/liba.so -> /usr/lib/liba.so.2 -> /usr/lib/liba.so.2.3

and so on.  It can easily exceed 6 symlinks.  I think the correct fix
is to make VFS not to overflow stacks.  Is it allowable change?
