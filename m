Hello,

I did not get any message from the kernel mailing list in the last few
days. Did something happen to LKML or is that a local problem of my
site? 

Please send a reply to the list with a CC to my private email address.
The reply to the list can make sure that I receive only one reply
(because as soon as someone has answered other members of the list can
see that they do not need send another answer) and the CC makes sure
that I can read the answer.

Thanks
  Christoph
