You mean the patch that only looks at videomode, dont you...

Well maybe it's best to use it as default, to avoid this bug 
"out of the box"...

But I will remake a patch to ovverride it so that the users who 
need/want the extra memory to be able to allocate it...
since I like the idea of giving the user the choice...

The next thing that comes to mind is of course that
it need to be done so that you can't kill the system with the
vram setting... but that should not be to hard...
