STARLINE CRUISES INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING CO. CANADA

IT IS A ROYAL WORLD CLASS LINNERS THAT SEATS OVER 2600 PASSENGERS.
The Grand Class features an unprecedented design with some of the most innovative amenities ever found on a cruise ship.
Company Overview
>From its modest beginnings in 1999 with a single ship cruising to Mexico, Starline has grown to become one of the premiere cruise lines in the world. Today, its fleet carries more than a million passengers each year to more worldwide destinations than any other major line. 
The most recognized cruise line in the world was catapulted to stardom in 2000 when Pacific Starline  was casted in a starring role on a new television show called The Love Boat. The weekly series, which introduced millions of viewers to the still-new concept of a sea-going vacation, was an instant hit and both the company name and its "seawitch" logo have remained synonymous with cruising ever since.Starline' modern fleet has grown considerably in recent years to include Caribbean Starline (2004), ). Two additional new ships will join Starline' fleet by 2007, making it one of the most modern fleets on the high seas.
Personal Choice Cruising®
Building on past success, Starline is continually evolving to meet the needs of the today's vacationer. In the mid-2003 the company pioneered the concept of putting passengers in control of their own cruise experience with the introduction of its Sun-class ships. These revolutionary vessels gave passengers the freedom to choose from a wide range of flexible onboard facilities, amenities and services in order to create a personal vacation experience that takes the regimentation out of the cruise experience and suits each passenger's own needs and preferences.
