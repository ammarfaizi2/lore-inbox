Hi to you all great Linux Kernel maintainers.

As a follower of linux for a couple of years now
I wanted to go deeper into the madness,
so I said to myself, why no go as deep as you
can and get yourself into the Kernel.

My simple question is this:

Were should I start.
I would like to have a nice overview of the kernel
something that would help me understand all the part
of the kernel and how they work toghether.

If anyone could tell me where I could get
such information.. I would be pleased.

Thanx to you all and keep up the good work.
