I've been trying to upgrade my kernel from 2.4.19 to 2.4.20 on a
linux-i686-gnu box [I use gcc-2.95.3, GNU ld version 2.13, GNU
assembler 2.13].

I first tried patching the kernel sources, reran xconfig and then

	 make bzImage && make modules && make modules install

The build died in the make modules step, in the ppp driver tree
complaining about not finding zlib.c.  

I deleted the source tree and started again with a full 2.4.20
tarball.  After configureing,  I ran

 make dep && make clean && make bzImage && make modules && make modules install

and get:

make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/lib'
ld -m elf_i386 -T /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds -e stext arch/i386/kernel/head.o arch/i386/kernel/init_task.o init/main.o init/version.o \

        -o vmlinux
drivers/net/net.o(.data+0xd4): undefined reference to `local symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1


It sounds like this is a problem with ld or as, but I'm not sure.  Any
suggestions?

P.S.,
