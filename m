	Have you tried my latest backport for agpgart from 2.5 to 2.4.21-pre4.
	If you did not, try it. I do not suggest that it will work correctly with 
your configuration (you did not mention which graphics card you own). I've 
tested it with ATI Radeon R9000 and GeForce 2MX400 on Abit(i810) mobo. And 
everything worked fine.
