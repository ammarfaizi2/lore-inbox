Hello,

I am getting ready to install a new server and am planning an installing
Linux on it. My Question is Does the 2.4.5 kernel support the Promise
SuperTrak100? I know there were problems with this card and Linux, I saw AC
was working on fixes for I2O in the 2.4.4 kernels. I just want to know if it
was fixed now. Sorry for cluttering up the list, I couldn't find the answer
in the archives, dejanews, or goggle..
