		   | THE DECLARATION OF EVOLUTION |
		   +------------------------------+
 _ _ _ 
| | | | HEN in the course of organic evolution it becomes obvious that
| | | | a mutational process is inevitably dissolving the physical and
|__/_/ neurological bonds which connect the members of one generation
to the past and inevitably directing them to assume among the species
of Earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature
and Nature's God entitle them, a decent concern for the harmony of
species requires that the causes of the mutation should be declared.

We hold these truths to be self evident:

   * That all species are created different but equal;

   * That they are endowed, each one, with certain inalienable rights;

   * That among them are Freedom to Live, Freedom to Grow, and Freedom
     to pursue Happiness in their own style;

   * That to protect these God-given rights, social structures
     naturally emerge, basing their authority on the principles of
     love of God and respect for all forms of life;

   * That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of life,
     liberty, and harmony, it is the organic duty of the young members
     of that species to mutate, to drop out, to initiate a new social
     structure, laying its foundations on such principles and
     organizing its power in such form as seems likely to produce the
     safety, happiness, and harmony of all sentient beings.

 Genetic wisdom, indeed, suggests that social structures long
established should not be discarded for frivolous reasons and
transient causes. The ecstasy of mutation is equally balanced by the
pain. Accordingly all experience shows that members of a species are
more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, rather than to
discard the forms to which they are accustomed.

 But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, all pursuing
invariably the same destructive goals, threaten the very fabric of
organic life and the serene harmony of the planet, it is the right, it
is the organic duty to drop out of such morbid covenants and to evolve
new loving social structures.

 Such has been the patient sufferance of the freedom-loving peoples of
this earth, and such is now the necessity which constrains us to form
new systems of government.

 The history of the white, menopausal, mendacious men now ruling the
planet earth is a history of repeated violation of the harmonious laws
of nature, all having the direct object of establishing a tyranny of
the materialistic aging over the gentle, the peace-loving, the young,
the colored. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to the judgement of
generations to come.

   * These old, white rulers have maintained a continuous war against
     other species of life, enslaving and destroying at whim fowl,
     fish, animals and spreading a lethal carpet of concrete and metal
     over the soft body of earth.

   * They have maintained as well a continual state of war among
     themselves and against the colored races, the freedom-loving, the
     gentle, the young. Genocide is their habit.

   * They have instituted artificial scarcities, denying peaceful folk
     the natural inheritance of earth's abundance and God's endowment.

   * They have glorified material values and degraded the spiritual.

   * They have claimed private, personal ownership of God's land,
     driving by force of arms the gentle from passage on the earth.

   * In their greed they have erected artificial immigration and
     customs barriers, preventing the free movement of people.

   * In their lust for control they have set up systems of compulsory
     education to coerce the minds of the children and to destroy the
     wisdom and innocence of the playful young.

   * In their lust for power they have controlled all means of
     communication to prevent the free flow of ideas and to block
     loving exchanges among the gentle.

   * In their fear they have instituted great armies of secret police
     to spy upon the privacy of the pacific.

   * In their anger they have coerced the peaceful young against their
     will to join their armies and to wage murderous wars against the
     young and gentle of other countries.

   * In their greed they have made the manufacture and selling of
     weapons the basis of their economies.

   * For profit they have polluted the air, the rivers, the seas.

   * In their impotence they have glorified murder, violence, and
     unnatural sex in their mass media.

   * In their aging greed they have set up an economic system which
     favors age over youth.

   * They have in every way attempted to impose a robot uniformity and
     to crush variety, individuality, and independence of thought.

   * In their greed, they have instituted political systems which
     perpetuate rule by the aging and force youth to choose between
     plastic conformity or despairing alienation.

   * They have invaded privacy by illegal search, unwarranted arrest,
     and contemptuous harassment.

   * They have enlisted an army of informers.

   * In their greed they sponsor the consumption of deadly tars and
     sugars and employ cruel and unusual punishment of the possession
     of life-giving alkaloids and acids.

   * They never admit a mistake. They unceasingly trumpet the virtue
     of greed and war. In their advertising and in their manipulation
     of information they make a fetish out of blatant falsity and
     pious self-enhancement. Their obvious errors only stimulate them to
     greater error and noisier self-approval.

   * They are bores.

   * They hate beauty.

   * They hate sex.

   * They hate life.

 We have warned them from time to time to their inequities and
blindness. We have addressed every available appeal to their withered
sense of righteousness. We have tried to make them laugh. We have
prophesied in detail the terror they are perpetuating. But they have
been deaf to the weeping of the poor, the anguish of the colored, the
rocking mockery of the young, the warnings of their poets. Worshipping
only force and money, they listen only to force and money. But we
shall no longer talk in these grim tongues.

 We must therefore acquiesce to genetic necessity, detach ourselves
from their uncaring madness and hold them henceforth as we hold the
rest of God's creatures - in harmony, life brothers, in their excess,
menaces to life.

 We, therefore, God-loving, peace-loving, life-loving, fun-loving men
and women, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the Universe for the
rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the Authority of
all sentient beings who seek gently to evolve on this planet, solemnly
publish and declare that we are free and independent, and that we are
absolved from all Allegiance to the United States Government and all
governments controlled by the menopausal, and that grouping ourselves
into tribes of like-minded fellows, we claim full power to live and
move on the land, obtain sustenance with our own hands and minds in
the style which seems sacred and holy to us, and to do all Acts and
Things which independent Freemen and Freewomen may of right do without
infringing on the same rights of other species and groups to do their
own thing.

 And for the support of this Declaration of Evolution with a firm
reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, and serenely
confident of the approval of generations to come, in whose name we
speak, do we now mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our
Fortunes, and our Sacred Honor.

   -- Dr. Timothy Leary, Ph.D.
