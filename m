That's only 1 aspect.  The frustrating part is bug reports mailed to the
list getting a response of "oh, that's fixed in the latest bk tree."

That's happened a dozen times in the last week...no wonder non-bk users
feel out of the loop.  I've been staring at the code for a lot of years
and it's finally just starting to make sense to me, now by the time I see
it the core hackers have moved on to something else.

Daily snapshots would be great.
