* Nobody is assuming that.  If you're hard enough to do a cross compile,
* you can build external modules using "make KERNEL_RELEASE=2.4.2
* KERNEL_SOURCE=/home/jamie/cross_compiling/kernel ARCH=mips64" or
* whatever.

Applications make that assumption all the time.

Yes, this is the kernel mail list, but applications use kernel services. By
tacitly agreeing that you get the kernel headers from /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/build/include that's what people will code into their makefiles.

Saying "oh, but applications should do that" isn't much of a argument, as there
isn't a better way of working out where a set of kernel headers are.

And "oh but applications should be using /usr/include/" doesn't cut it. There
are times when you really do need to be able to build things outside of the
kernel tree that are kernel specific.
