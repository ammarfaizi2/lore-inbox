Buffalo Technologies wrote to me they would put a GPL notice on their 
website and they haven't done so. They did not release source code to 
me nor to anyone else. I am quite disappointed by all of this.

The other two manufacturers I sent emails to, Belkin and Linksys,  
did not respond at all.

I will send another email to Buffalo Technologies and this time I 
will include the excellent research by Andrew Miklas. I hope the 
issue will be resolved eventually.

Regards,

Richard.
