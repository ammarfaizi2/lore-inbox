Subject: bkbits.net back up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Both bkbits.net and openlogging.org are back up.  If you see any problems
mail support@bitmover.com.

Other addresses associated with bitmover.com are still having problems,
i.e., our website is down.  I think that's an aliasing/routing/iptables
problem that we hope to have fixed today or tomorrow.
