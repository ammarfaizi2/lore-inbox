Alan,

I think highly of women and even employ one in a programming position -
there is no bias on my part. In fact, she is even ON the linuxchix
mailinglist, and I suspect that she would've appreciated my joke.

If people feel put of by me making a joke, well, I apologise for that.

In my not so humble opinion however, I didn't insult anybody above, but then
again, I've been known to be wrong.

Regards,

bert
