Hi, Andrew!

The thing is still not fixed in 2.6.13-rc4. I had a long discussion about 
this with Mark Salyczyn and Mark Haverkamp. We came out with a temporary 
workaround, which was to set the AAC_MAX_32BIT_SGBCOUNT in aacraid.h to 
512 instead of 8192. The patch for this was presented 8.7.2005 on 
linux-scsi list by Mark Haverkamp. However this constant solution may (?) 
have some performance impact on the configurations which are capable of 
delivering a better performance (with respect to this constant at hand).

IMHO the real solution to this problem is the new Adaptec variant of 
aacraid driver which uses the 'new comm' technology to negotiate all these 
essential parameters directly with the hardware instead of relying on some 
preset constants. Mark Salyzyn has the patches prepared in his patch 
queue, and I vote for pushing it into the mainline ASAP.

Just two paragraphs to quote Mark's answer to my question about pushing it 
to mainline:

So I just hope this may speed up the effort of pushing it into the 
mainline a bit. :-) Currently I'm using it and it is working just fine. 
(Other thing is that the performance still could be a little better, but 
that's another issue and the old driver suffers from that as well.)
