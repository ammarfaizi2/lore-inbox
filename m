Hail,

I posted a report a while back, no answer.

Who should I be talking to wrt to the irq 11: nobody cared issue?

I'm happy to provide as much info as possible but need to know what info 
is required.

I'm happily running 2.6.7, tried the latest and greatest (2.6.12) and 
found the problem, then started by looking at 2.6.8 and found the 
problem there too.

It happens on boot, is a showstopper and I'm wondering what, if anything 
useful I can provide you guys.

Throw me a bone...

   Nige
