Jörn, the best thing about my hack was that it didn't interfere with the
regexes for the other archs. Andreas better solved that problem by
providing the result in $1, by using some foreknowlegde of the objdump
output format.

I whole-heartedly endorse the signed-off-by-Geert and provided-by-Andreas
patch on the basis of even less interference with the existing code. i.e.

    http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/18/104

But, if you really want my patch, I'll provide it here as well as the m68k
lists... but really, Andreas did a much nicer job given that the assembler
is generated by objdump.
