Hi there,

when i install kernel 2.4.3 or higher on my slackware
system the card (3c900) gets detected but doesn't do
anything, i also get the line "using NWAY 8" or something
like that (had to switch back to 2.4.2 to type e-mail)
wondered if anyone else had this problem and if there's
some way to solve it?

if you need any other info please mail
Regards, Ronnie
