I am sorry to see that you still insist in claiming things that are not in this
announcement.

You did inform me about this Linux "self non-compliance" and you are the only 
person who did claim that there is a problem. I spend a lot of time in trying 
to find a work around for this problem and I am in hope that I did find a 
working solution.

	Please stop claiming things I did never write!

I did never mention that this was a POSIX non-compliance, this is entirely from
your imagination. I rather mentioned that this is a problem caused by the fact 
that Linux changed it's behavior in a way that breaks existing applications.

For this reason it is apropriate to call the code that deals with the problem
"a workaround".
