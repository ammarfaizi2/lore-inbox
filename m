Well, I got off linux-kernel while 2.0.3x was still current, and didn't return
until a few months ago.  Apparently the definitions have changed over the past
few years.

On another subject, is all this new "testXX-preYY" stuff over now that 2.4.0 is
out, and will we be going back to the standard x.y.z numbering scheme?  Or is
this another thing that's changed for good?  I really miss being able to apply
all the patches at once with linux/scripts/patchkernel.

By your personal definition of stable 2.0.3x is the current stable kernel.
