	Hi

For years, I have been willing to write a good patching/merging tool. In 
my understanding, the kernel is the most patching/merging demanding 
project and now that bitkeeper is gone, there is a hole to be filled.

What would be the requirements for a good patching/merging tool in your 
opinion ? What are the use cases ?

How much of integration is required with the SCM, git in the kernel case ?

I am not subscribed, so please CC: me any response.

	best regards,

	Philippe
