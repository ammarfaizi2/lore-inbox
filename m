Subject: AMD STPGNT mode without soundcard noise?

Hello,

I'm almost sure that this is not the proper list to ask this question
but I don't know what list would be. On second thoughts, there are a lot
of poeple with AMD experience subscribed to this list.
Please CC me in any answer.

I have a Shuttle AN35N NForce2 motherboard and an AMD Sempron 2400+. I
like to have the STPGNT mode enabled. The downside is I get some noise
on my soundcards with STPGNT enabled. I think this is a known issue.

I got an onboard soundchip and a Midiman Audiophile 2496. I use both of
them. The noise on the onboard soundchip is louder.

Is there any way to reduce/eliminate this noise, maybe by setting
different bits with setpci to enabling STPGNT?


Thanks


Sebastian
