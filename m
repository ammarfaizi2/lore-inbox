A single or dual Athlon also makes a nice computer, and probably gives
you much more value for money.

This doesn't really look like a gamers machine to me, so I think you'd
better replace the geforce with a Matrox G450 or G550. Nvidia based
video cards have some known problems, especially when used together
with the Nvidia binary-only drivers.

Desktops, laptops, servers, handhelds, embedded stuff. My main machine
is a laptop, though.

Ever tried to carry a desktop as hand luggage on board of a plane so
you could read your email during a transatlantic flight?

Nonsense. Computers are equally expensive in Europe and the US.
