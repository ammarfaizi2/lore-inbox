If yes, what is the correct format (I tried the above with the UUID 
reported from dumpe2fs, didn't work).  If no, please consider as an 
enhancement request.

Please copy me on replies, there is no sense in subscribing when I can't 
answer other people's questions and rarely have a question myself. 
 Google for "root=UUID Linux kernel" produced 3 documents - nothing 
useful.  Thank you in advance for any reply.

Why do I ask?  Multiple hard disks with multiple Linux distributions 
installed, mix and match on different computers at times.  Do I dare 
change the various distro's '/' label to something else?
