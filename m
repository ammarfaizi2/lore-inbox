For all you keyboards freaks out there (including myself),
the new version of LTT (0.9.2) enables keyboard usage to
scroll the traces. This is very usefull since most traces
are huge and using the mouse is a rather slow process.

There are no changes to the internals, though. Not yet, that
is. This is mostly a "usefullness" update.

Here's a summary of the keyboard accelerators available:
UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, PageUP, PageDOWN: Scroll the even graph.
CTRL+PageUP, CTRL+PageDOWN: ZoomIN, ZoomOUT.

That's it. There's more but you can get the rest on the
project's web page:

Cheers.

P.S.: The web page has had a much awaited (at least by me)
face lift. Feel free to voice your comments. Enjoy ... :)
