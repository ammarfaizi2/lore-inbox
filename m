   But he wants some of "%99 of people with sparc32 problems" to move
   into "%1" category instead.

Thank you, that is exactly what I meant.

Look, if someone reports some bug once, that's ok.  You report it
twice, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that you're merely
reminding us.  The third and further time, it's a whine.  Everyone
here knows there are sun4m problems, and Tom in particular knows it is
a well known problem because I know he reads this list.  Therefore Tom
was engaging in what I'd like to term a double-whine.
