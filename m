That is not something Microsoft could leverage.
Actually, it is something Linux can leverage against Microsoft, because
Microsoft keeps on telling people that using GPL is a nightmare because
it forces all your intellectual property on the street for free.  They
proved that wrong themselves.  That is quite a strong argument.  It
should be publicized, not buried.  We should thank them publicly.
