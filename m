Hmm, I don't recall ever telling you that.

I searched through my mail archive here is what I said to you last year
on these two patches.  As far as I can see I don't have a reply from you
on either subject.  So if you could reply to my questions below then I
can consider your patches again.

1. Deflate fix:

Are you saying that you're feeding it PAGE_SIZE chunks and it's
giving you back something bigger than a page? That is expected
since the nature of compression in general is that not everything
is compressible.  Data streams which are not compressible will
end up bigger than what you start with.

What would be a bug is if you feed it something that's
deflateBound^-1(PAGE_SIZE) bytes long and it spits back
something that's longer than a page.

Well if you could give me a snippet of code that actually uses this
stuff to compress pages then I might have a better idea of what it's
trying to do.

2. LZF:

Any reason why vmalloc can't be used?

Where are these two buffers used anyway?

This is a double-free of local_buffer.
