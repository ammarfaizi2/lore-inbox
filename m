II would like to know if there is any way in Linux to monitor the stack 
of the current program ?
Ie : I would like to get the adress of the first element of the stack, 
the adress of the last one, the full size of the stack and so on.
Is-there a doc on the web on how to manage the stack ?

Moreover, I would also like to know how to get the information on the 
virtual memory used by the current process (the size of memory currently 
used by the process) ...
