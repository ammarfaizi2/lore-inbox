Hi all,

I have been working on a code and I have really got
stuck at one place. I have netdevice struct of the
interface, and I want to know its ip addresses
(including ipv6 address). I have read through the
netdevice structure and got no clues, how to go about
it. Maybe I am not looking in the right direction. I
will greatly appreciate any pointers I could get.

Thanknig in anticipation.
