Many people including me are getting unusual Kernel 
trouble recently with 2.4.21-pre3-ac*. In my case, with 
2.4.21-pre3-ac2 I got segmentation fault from 
a command (tar) where I never suspected.   Yet no one seems to know 
what part of the the kernel update caused all this 
trouble.

Does anyone have any guess?

G,. H. S.
