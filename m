I agree that a different wording might have avoided this.

But I also must say that paying even a little bit of attention on the part  
of the readers would also have avoided this.

It is certainly not the first time the autoconfigurator has been discussed  
here, and it was made clear *every* *single* *time* that this is an  
optional thing, usually several times.

This is not a case of witholding "critical info". This is a case of  
readers without any attention span.

On a mailing list such as this, the number of such readers is highly  
disappointing. It feels just like Windows.

In fact, I am beginning to suspect that some people protest something they  
full well *know* is not the case, just to stir up trouble.
