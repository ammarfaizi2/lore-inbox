While one issue stands resolved (that a vendor complying with clause 3a of
GPL 2.0 does not have to comply with 3b), the GPL may have been
misprepresented by MontaVista, as per the opinion of a FSF member (Dave
Turner via RT <license-violation@fsf.org>):

Actually, they're wrong -- if they choose (3)(b), their offer must be
open to all third parties.  And they're wrong about who their
"obligation" is to -- legally speaking, their license comes from the
copyright holder.
