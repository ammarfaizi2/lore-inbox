I've been using the email address on the net, I think the link was 
down for most of the night until minutes ago.

Robert has a K7 version of burnMMX which is tentatively being called 
burnMMX2.  I think he would prefer to be directly in touch with people 
testing it.  Thus, it is not posted on the website but available only 
through email.
