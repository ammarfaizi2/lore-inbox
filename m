Well the reason I made them all __devinit in my patch is because it
also tries to maintain the same PCI probing order as a builtin kernel
when IDE is built as a module.

To do that all the PCI driver modules are loaded before probing takes
place.  Therefore if any probing funciton is declared as __init then
this will not work.
