Logitech's rather legendary lack of linux support, apparently 
bordering on hatred, virtually guarantees there will never be a 
driver for it, unless you can figure out who actually made it, and 
con them out of a copy of the devices API.  I *almost* got the docs 
for the Sunplus chipset a year ago, but they quit answering my emails 
after they said they would check with the vendor (guess who) who 
actually sold it.

I'd send the message with my wallet by taking it back for a 
refund/exchange and getting something that is known to be supported, 
both by the maker, and by linux.

They do make good mice though...
