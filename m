Hi,

You think this is impolite? I've been quiet lately in these flame wars, 
because I couldn't have staid that polite to an arrogant asshole, but I 
won't stay quiet when Larry can now insult other developers and gets away 
with it. If someone is whining around here, then it's only Larry. A lot of 
people are contributing to the kernel, but he is the only one constantly 
whining around that he should be treated special and makes silly threats.
Can we please get cause and effect right here? Of course Larry is 
completely free to choose whatever license he wants, but advertising a 
stupid license in a free software environment will of course cause 
disagreement and complaints. There is _nothing_ anyone but Larry can do 
anything about it, but amazingly enough Larry manages to take every single 
complaint as personal insult and makes all of the bk flame wars worse 
than they already are.
Andreas sig is about as offensive as a "Don't drink and drive" spot. The 
bk license is problematic for a number of developers and it's very 
important that new developers are made aware of the problems and not just 
think it's cool to use bk because the mighty Linus is using it.

bye, Roman
