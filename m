Poor Riley,

Probably I should not answer, I think you know all the facts already.
But just to be sure:

(i) There are two different packages, kbd and a forked version,
console-tools. Both contain roughly the same programs.
In your earlier mails you seemed aware of that, but now you report
that the console-tools version of loadkeys does not want to
print a kbd version. No surprise there.

(ii) I am the maintainer of both mount and util-linux.
If I say that there exists no more recent version of mount
than the one found in util-linux, you can believe me.

Andries
