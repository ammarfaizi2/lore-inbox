Hmm, what about common symbol generation?  i.e. the linker looses the
ability
to throw out "multiply defined symbol" errors where you fail to
initialise it
to a value.

Okay extern global variables in the kernel need to be controlled and it
is not
like many get added, however it is possible that one developer may never
know
it is already in use by another part of the kernel, when their oh-no-new
driver
is added.  Since the linkers assistance in this issue has just been
disabled.

Is 'gas' able to be configured to never emit common symbols, but emit
BBS
symbols instead, or is 'ld' able to be configured to never merge common
symbols but throw up "multiply defined symbol" errors.  Then everyone is
safe.

PDAs!!! :)  Excellent work Russell.
