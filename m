Hi, all,

I am new to linux device driver. I do not know
how to change a module to a character device driver.
I have a module by hand, I want to modify it
to a character device driver. Then I can make it
in linux kernel, and do not need modutils rpm.
If someone knows, please help me. Thanks!


Barry
