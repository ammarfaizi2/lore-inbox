All,

Emulex has spent the last 8 wks significantly reorganizing its code base to
create a native 2.6 driver. Although there are still a couple of small items
remaining, we believe we're ready to have the community review the sources.

The source for the driver can be downloaded from it's project page on source
forge - http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpfcxxxx/ . Be sure to download the
20040507 snapshot - and the version for the 2.6 kernel.

If you have any questions, please contact me.  I look forward to your
comments.

Thanks...

-- James Smart
