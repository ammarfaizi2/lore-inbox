Which is very very hard.

Think about it logically. Today to get a domain you need a credit/debit
card. A credit/debit card is ID managed by organisations very keen that
they don't get copied or faked. You are talking about building a
worldwide system that is more effective than the ones the banks run: for
a ten US dollar (ie peanuts and falling) value domain.
