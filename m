  The data is there for everybody.  As long as we can automate the
extraction I don't see any issue with multiple people extracting
and using with other tools.  Data and manure only work if you
can spread it around.

  My opinion is that the more uses of the data the better.  So
the question is, "What does Larry need to make this happen?".
