Hello.

I tried kernel 2.5.17, and I can't get my PS/2 keyboard to work with
it. After booting, i can see login prompt, can move my mouse, but I can't
write anything with my keyboard.
I used kernel 2.4.18 before, and everything was fine.
I have Soltek's motherboard (SL-75DRV4 on VIA KT266A).

Maybe it's my fault, but I tried everything and can't get my keyboard
work.

If you need more information about my system, write it.

Thank's for your work.
