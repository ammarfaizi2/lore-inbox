As an Asus A7M266-D user myself, I've never had any stability issues of this
sort.  Though i'me runnign dual 1400+ with Volcano 6cu.  The cpu's run at
about 45 degrees and i've never had any problems with stability.  Though we
did have stability issues in the past with Mps 1.4, this seems to have been
fixed in 2.5.17.
