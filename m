Sorry Alan, but they asked for it.  All day long they have been saying 
stuff that isn't true.  "The RTAI core is now released under the GPL"
and then you go look and it says LGPL.  And the claims that they respect
the GPL in the parts that came from RTL is crap, go look at the copyrights
they put on the files, files they didn't create, and it says LGPL, not GPL.

Go read the code and then see what you think.  It's blatent.  You either
haven't read the code or I just don't understand your position.  It's
exactly like someone took a GPLed device driver, enhanced it, and then 
decided that they could put their different and incompatible license on it.

Don't take my word for it, go read the code.
