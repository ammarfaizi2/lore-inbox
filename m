Indeed there is a standard response. In fact, the FAQ has a few
paragraphs on the subject! Pity the FAQ wasn't consulted before
posting this question :-(
You know, the FAQ is mentioned in the welcome message when you sign up
to the list, and at the bottom of every message on this list:
Please read the FAQ at  http://www.tux.org/lkml/

There really is no excuse for not reading the FAQ.
