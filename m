The only thing defective I can see here is you:

1. You posted this to a totally inappropriate mailing list.
2. You posted with a tone that shows you are totally uninterested in getting
	help with your problems.
3. You have failed to use the proper support channels.
3. You trouble shooting skills are defective:
	If you think that a Linux distribution that works just fine for test of
	thousands of people fails to a buggy linker then you are a fool.

	Just because it works with other software doesn't mean that the 
	memory is good. If you have a single bad bit, then you are very
	sensitive on alignment a different piece of software may have no
	issues.

But why should I expect anything reasonable from a poster at
analogic.com? (apologies to those there who have improved!) :)
