What I don't understand is why people use the form virii, with a double I!

Just like the plural of abacus is abaci, the plural of cactus is cacti
(check the dictionary if you don't believe me), shouldn't the plural of
virus be viri, with one I at the end (of course, "viruses" is also currently
accepted as a plural, and even preferred by some people).

I think people get confused by the fact that the plural of radius is radii.
That extra "I" comes from the i in radius - it shouldn't appear in the plural
of "virus"! The plural of the different word "virius" should have been virii.

Note that bacteria is already plural - bacterium is the singular.

There's a more computer relevant fact: "data" is a plural noun, whose
singular is "datum". Similarly, "media" is plural, whose singular is
"medium". So constructions like "datas" or "medias" are wrong, although
they are becoming more and more accepted...

Does anybody still use the form formulae as a plural of formula? I do, but
I think I belong to a dying breed :)
