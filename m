Only on my company's e-mail server.  My company typically gets "zero"
emails from outside the US.  If I get a piece of spam (sorry they are
typically from outside the US), I just block the entire .com.br domain.
I get far less SPAM now!  I cannot express how much I loathe SPAM!
I have taken this one in particular out just for you....  :-)
I am the only one at my company really active on the internet..
apologies
