	Hi;

	Using 2.5.51, my 3c509 works.
>=2.5.52 the OS cant seem to receive packets. ifconfig reveals
that TX and RX are being incremented for the arp requests it
sends, and the replies, though. I turned on debuging in the
driver, and see packets come in like: (after a ping attempt)

 eth0: interrupt, status 2011.
	In rx_packet(), status 2011, rx_status 383c.
 Receiving packet size 60 status 383c.
 eth0: exiting interrupt, status 2000.
 eth0: el3_start_xmit(length = 42) called, status 2000.

	But the arp replies arent 'seen', and it just
keeps arping.
	I didnt see any diff between relevant drivers/net
stuff between .51 and .52  None of the debugging stuff looked
wrong, no complaints, etc. All compiled with gcc-2.95.3
	Does anyone have any guesses?
