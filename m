Yeah, with a demonstrated 30 year MTBF of the power-grid and
standby power we might make it.........

Battery-backed SRAM "drives" in the gigabyte sizes already exist.
Terabytes should not be too far off.

Soon those "drives" will be as cheap as their mechanical emulations
and you won't need those metal boxes with the rotating mass anymore.
The batteries last about 10 years. Better than most mechanical
drives.
