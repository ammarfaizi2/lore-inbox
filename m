AntiVir for Linux is _free_ for non-commercial use. Quote from
http://www.hbedv.com/infos/prices.htm
"[...] AntiVir for Linux Workstations is also free of charge for private
(individual, non-commercial) use. Just send a brief e-mail with your name,
address and an assurance that you will only use Linux on your private
computer to linux_registration@antivir.de. We will then send you a licence
file for AntiVir for Linux. Support is provided exclusively by e-mail via
linux_support@antivir.de."

Anyway, several anti-virus products for Linux/Unix do exist, please
see http://www.openantivirus.org/av-unix_e.txt.
