I thought the whole open source idea was that people could share quality
software that is free to view and modify. :)

Maybe Im too naive but I really believe that good commenting style
should be the default way for _all_ opensource developers to opperate
simply because the practise of "being free to view and modify code" is
helped by good comments.=20

However I do understand that unpaid volunteers will tend to focus on the
things they enjoy more so than things they do not, and I dont have any
problems with that.

The Learning curve with a project this big is hellishly steep though, so
young ones such as myself can use all the code comments we can get.
I know it seems rather obnoxious to be telling you this, sorry.

Best Regards.
