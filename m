I don't want to port anything. I don't know ide and I don't want to know 
ide. I want to be able to use it. I am an ide USER. You are the ide 
DEVELOPER. If you take away functionality YOU have to provide a 
replacement. NOT tell me, the USER to write it.

I don't want to do it myself. I want YOU to do it because YOU are taking 
away the functionality that already exists.
