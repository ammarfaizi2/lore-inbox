	This affects Compaq's new Compaq Presario 700's that were released
last summer, which has been discussed on this list several times. Peter=20
has a FIC A360+ board which he has managed to atleast play peripherals like
CD-ROM to work, this is one the HP laptops I believe.
	I haven't been able to do that, with any of the default_ops or=20
eapd settings suggested on this list, on the Compaq presario I'm sending=20
this e-mail from. Only that frustrating crosstalk sound I get by turning
the peripheral volumes all the way up. The master volume does nothing.
