Hello,

Since 2.6.17-rc1-mm3, some applications behave strangely here:
- video players (mplayer, vlc) are randomly frozen after less than 1
minute playing . They are killable by ^C.
- some network java application (freenet-0.7) quit after a few
minutes running.

A bissection point out time-i386-clocksource-drivers.patch as the
sucker.

I noticed that, since 2.6.17-rc1-mm3, pit clocksource is installed
instead of acpi_pm clocksource. Booting with "clocksource=3Dacpi_pm"
does not help.

[root@antares ~]# grep clocksource dmesg-2.6.17-rc*
dmesg-2.6.17-rc1-mm1:Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc1-mm1:Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc1-mm2:Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc1-mm2:Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc1-mm3:Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc1-mm3:Time: pit clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc2-mm1:Time: tsc clocksource has been installed.
dmesg-2.6.17-rc2-mm1:Time: pit clocksource has been installed.

Is pit clocksource broken ? If so, how can I get back acpi_pm
clocksource ?

Feel free to ask for more information or to send me test patches.
