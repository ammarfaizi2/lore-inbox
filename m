I'ld like to also +1 the current development model.

However I think the 2.6.X should become 2.X; the 6 is starting to be
meaningless, and it's not going to be upgraded ever with the current
development model.

this leave 2.X.Y "namespace" to the current stable team (same
development model as the 2.6.X.Y).
