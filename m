Greg,

Maybe one of these days I'll be able to make some progress on getting  
64-bit resources going.  However, I was wondering if you would be  
willing to setup a GIT tree and coordinate patches from various people.

I know I had things work for some embedded PPC targets a while back.   
Maybe if there is something more public we will make more progress  
and get more people involved.

let me know
