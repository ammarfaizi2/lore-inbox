I think (though I might be wrong) this is not considered a "script used to
control compilation" in GPL acception, even if it does this. It is not
included in the kernel sources, it is generated by other scripts
(kconfig.tk for example, which is also generated). This is like, for
example, intermediar .s files generated from .c ones. Nobody would bother
to include this in the sources.

I don't think it should be included in the kernel sources because you
can generate it by yourself (of course, you want to know theirs). So, they
might not be forced to give you the .config file.

Regards.
