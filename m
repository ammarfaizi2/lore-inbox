There is a choice of ONE of THREE options.  Company A may EITHER:

1. include the source
OR
2. accompany the binary with a written offer for the source
OR
3.  if it is a noncommercial RE-distribution of the binary, include the 
offer that was received in terms with #2.

If the binary is downloaded from somewhere, having the source available 
at the same place counts as #1.

IANAL, but that's how it all boils down for me.  Hopefully that'll help 
someone understand that part a little better.
