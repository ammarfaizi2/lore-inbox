To Whom It May Concern,

It appears that we have been victimized by a spammer who is impersonati=
ng us. Someone has been sending spam emails and putting our email addre=
ss in the =93from=94 field to make it seem like it is coming from us. T=
his problem is not limited to InvestorGuide but has also happened to ov=
er 200 other companies. If you received an email from newsletter@invest=
orguide.com, we just wanted to make it clear that we are NOT the compan=
y who sent it. We do not spam and are fully compliant with anti-spam la=
ws. If you would like to read more about this problem, please check out=
