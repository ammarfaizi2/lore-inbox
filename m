Hi,

(Could you please fix your mailer? linux-m68k.org.com does not really
exist.)

That's fine with me, but nonetheless I'd really like to know where it will
go to. Just fixing the easy problems is simple, but so far I haven't seen
any plan on how to fix the hard problems. Anyone starting to fix all the
problems should have at least some ideas how to do it and I'd really like
to hear them. I don't want to discourage anyone, but he should understand
the complete problem first before going for the easy targets.

bye, Roman
