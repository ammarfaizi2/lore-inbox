Some people don't want to be only ones donating, some others just will
just wait & see if somebody elses money saves the project. Also, your
money may not be enough to fund that project and you are left with no
improvements. Or you could be overfunding the project (never seen this
happen though). You have no warranties where and how the money would be
usued.

A fundation focusing on this issue alone would be the best solution for
solving this "fragmentation" problem.

No problem here really. No restricted downloads, not anti-piracy code.
No added burdens. No BSA. Just the legal obligation to pay $10 a year.
If you don't pay, nobody will come looking for you, but at least you'll
know you owe somebody real money.
