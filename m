   I said publically that this situation will change in 2.4.22-pre.
   
Great.

   If you think the situation didnt got better during that time, I'm
   pleased to giveup 2.4.x maintenance.
   
   Is that fine for you?
   
I have no desire to take you away from your 2.4.x duties.  In fact, I
as much as anyone else, want you to work as 2.4.x maintainer.

Therefore, you should not think twice about asking people such as
myself for help if you want it.

I fully expect you to resolve the situation. :-)
