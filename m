Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] remove the broken SUN_AURORA driver
Message-ID: <20070104185338.GH20714@stusta.de>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

The SUN_AURORA driver:
- has been marked as BROKEN for more than two years and
- is still marked as BROKEN.

Drivers that had been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be
unlikely to be revived in the forseeable future.

But if anyone wants to ever revive this driver, the code is still
present in the older kernel releases.

- *	linux/drivers/sbus/char/aurora.h -- Aurora multiport driver
- *
- *	Copyright (c) 1999 by Oliver Aldulea (oli@bv.ro)
- *
- *	This code is based on the RISCom/8 multiport serial driver written
- *	by Dmitry Gorodchanin (pgmdsg@ibi.com), based on the Linux serial
- *	driver, written by Linus Torvalds, Theodore T'so and others.
- *	The Aurora multiport programming info was obtained mainly from the
- *	Cirrus Logic CD180 documentation (available on the web), and by
- *	doing heavy tests on the board. Many thanks to Eddie C. Dost for the
- *	help on the sbus interface.

- *	along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
- *	Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
- *
- *	Revision 1.0
- *
- *	This is the first public release.
- *
- *	This version needs a lot of feedback. This is the version that works
- *	with _my_ board. My board is model 1600se, revision '@(#)1600se.fth
- *	1.2 3/28/95 1'. The driver might work with your board, but I do not
- *	guarantee it. If you have _any_ type of board, I need to know if the
- *	driver works or not, I need to know exactly your board parameters
- *	(get them with 'cd /proc/openprom/iommu/sbus/sio16/; ls *; cat *')
- *	Also, I need your board revision code, which is written on the board.
- *	Send me the output of my driver too (it outputs through klogd).
- *
- *	If the driver does not work, you can try enabling the debug options
- *	to see what's wrong or what should be done.
- *
- *	I'm sorry about the alignment of the code. It was written in a
- *	128x48 environment.
- *
- *	I must say that I do not like Aurora Technologies' policy. I asked
- *	them to help me do this driver faster, but they ended by something
- *	like "don't call us, we'll call you", and I never heard anything
- *	from them. They told me "knowing the way the board works, I don't
- *	doubt you and others on the net will make the driver."
- *	The truth about this board is that it has nothing intelligent on it.
- *	If you want to say to somebody what kind of board you have, say that
- *	it uses Cirrus Logic processors (CD180). The power of the board is
- *	in those two chips. The rest of the board is the interface to the
- *	sbus and to the peripherals. Still, they did something smart: they
- *	reversed DTR and RTS to make on-board automatic hardware flow
- *	control usable.
- *	Thanks to Aurora Technologies for wasting my time, nerves and money.

- *	linux/drivers/sbus/char/aurora.c -- Aurora multiport driver
- *
- *	Copyright (c) 1999 by Oliver Aldulea (oli at bv dot ro)
- *
- *	This code is based on the RISCom/8 multiport serial driver written
- *	by Dmitry Gorodchanin (pgmdsg@ibi.com), based on the Linux serial
- *	driver, written by Linus Torvalds, Theodore T'so and others.
- *	The Aurora multiport programming info was obtained mainly from the
- *	Cirrus Logic CD180 documentation (available on the web), and by
- *	doing heavy tests on the board. Many thanks to Eddie C. Dost for the
- *	help on the sbus interface.

- *	(at your option) any later version.
- *
- *	This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
- *	but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
- *	MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

- *	You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
- *	along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
- *	Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
- *
- *	Revision 1.0
- *
- *	This is the first public release.
- *
- *	Most of the information you need is in the aurora.h file. Please
- *	read that file before reading this one.
- *
- *	Several parts of the code do not have comments yet.
- * 
- * n.b.  The board can support 115.2 bit rates, but only on a few
- * ports. The total badwidth of one chip (ports 0-7 or 8-15) is equal
- * to OSC_FREQ div 16. In case of my board, each chip can take 6
- * channels of 115.2 kbaud.  This information is not well-tested.
- * 
- * Fixed to use tty_get_baud_rate().
- *   Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>, 2001-Oct-12
