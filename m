Well in Austria there is a law: if you walk through an area that is not 
public and do this for a very long time years and suddenly the owner 
stops you from doing this, you could sue him for stopping you doing a 
usual thing.

But real life issues and software laws are more than two kind of shoes. 
They are two kind of universes.

Right and Code changes always happens, some approve i some not. And 
there will be always people not like it.

Fact is the kernel is a GPL thing so logically the coders want to keep 
it GPL,
