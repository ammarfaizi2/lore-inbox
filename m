Yeah, I saw that part Karl, but the bottom line in their position 
was to limit our choices and choose for us their oppresive views.  It's
also tortorious to post such a petition as a mean to attack a for

pulling this on Novell or Microsoft, and watch how fast you go to court.

These people are bullies.
