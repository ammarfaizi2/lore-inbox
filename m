Well, 2.5.65-mm1 trashed all my data... Just kidding.

Actually, I'm sitting here with a load of over 25, and my gnome2 menus
go like they're being chased by friggin fire ants. How many cans of
whoop-ass does linux have to open for crying out loud???

Almost like anticipatory /menus/! ;) Almost think I hear a *whoosh* as
I'm plinking around with 20 cpp processes running simultaneously. Nice!
Damn nice!

So, I guess this is a subjective interactivity changes report. So, now,
Performance == Holy sheet!
