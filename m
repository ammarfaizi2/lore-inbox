Sorry for the off-topic message, but this will be of interest to some here.

There are a couple of bills being proposed in the Oregon legislature.  One 
to stop UCITA and one to adopt it.  (For those of you not familiar with 
UCITA, it is a nasty little provision being pushed that would make 
click-thru licences and all the other variants binding, as well as 
outlawing reverse engineering and other things.) More info on it can be 
found at: 
http://www.ieee.org/organizations/pubs/newsletters/npss/june2000/position.ht 
m and http://www.ieeeusa.org/forum/grassroots/ucita/

It turns out the person who has sponsored the bill to enact UCITA into law 
is the head of the Judiciary committee, so this could get interesting.

If you are interested in testifying against UCITA contact Damon Elder at 
delder1@gladstone.uoregon.edu.  He is the intern for Representative Phil 
Barnhart.

Thanks!
