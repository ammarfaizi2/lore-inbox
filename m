Something definitely should be done to help "stabilize" the tree; it's not
really a big deal for most of us if something is broken, as you know there
will be a fix posted very soon after the release, _but_ bugs like these
don't exactly make Linux "look good" to the rest of the UNIX community. A
FreeBSD advocate might say "well, FreeBSD never does _that_". My suggestion
to help fix the problem would be to do what SGI does; have two seperate
trees that strive to stay as close to each other as possible, but one
becomes part of the "maintaince stream", where only bug fixes and the such
are added, and a "features stream", where actual new features are added in.
Take a look at some of the IRIX web pages at http://www.sgi.com/ for a
better idea of how that works, but believe me, it works. This would be in
addition to some sort of testing suite that each official kernel must pass
before it is released. With the growing number of (important/big) Linux
users, we must make sure each kernel is rock-solid before being released.
This is definitely more of a political topic than a technical one, but it
has to be addressed nonetheless.

> I thought that the -pre would be the developer kernels, and that an actual
release (2.4.14) would have been somewhat tested.  I fully understand that a
'runtime' bug in the vm or some other system could arrise and that is one
thing. I also understand when a 'less used' driver like NTFS or VFAT breaks,
but to see bugs in the loop device in a 'stabilizing' kernel is something
that I thought I'd never see.

was open that stuff was backported to 2.2.x.  I also heard that ext3 might
end up in 2.4.15, which I'd love to see happen (that and lm_sensors)

small bugs.  Like maybe where the kernel is posted (in my case obtaining
from ftp.kernel.org) there should be a readme.first.2.4.14 for every version
of the kernel and in there things like this could be stated.  Simple one
line in loop.c commment out the two lines or remove the two lines with
deactivate_page.
