Hello Riley!

As I said in another post on the list,

"http://www.mcafeeb2b.com/naicommon/buy-try/try/products-evals.asp

Go there, select your language and LINUX, and you will get a survey to
fill out that then lets you test drive their stuff for linux."

I don't feel that I am particularly blasé, but I will concede that you
have several good points.  My main point was that people seem to be more
interested in the server doing the scanning for them rather than taking
responsibility for their own (lack of) security.  Your view point is
just as valid.

And I don't think your experience with McAfee as reported is typical at
all.  If it was, I'd still be having problems, and NAI would be out of
business.  How long ago was this?  What version of the product?   What
OS?  How did you update?  What 14 Virii were you hit with?  Did you
contact McAfee for support?  I'd be very interested to get more details
about this.

Regards,
Scott

|
| Depends how you view it - I'd much rather host my mailing lists on a
| server that I knew scans for virii and deals with any it finds than
| one that doesn't.

|
| McAfee isn't a guarantee, no more than any other virii scanner is. I
| used to use McAfee, and had it in auto-update mode. I still got hit by
| FOURTEEN virii within half an hour of it updating itself!

|
| Even if you're careful, you can still get hit, so don't rest on your
| laurels...
|

|
| My own viewpoint is somewhat less blase than yours - the more virii
| scanners between the originator and me, the lower the likelihood of my
| systems getting a virii.

|
| Whether people are ignorant or unreliable has about as much to do with
| whether their computers can catch virii as with whether they can. The
| only people likely to claim otherwise are virii writers, IMHO.

|
| The basic point of this duscussion is that the email system's
| instructions are flawed and need changing.

| Best wishes from Riley.
