So what?  What's the big deal of releasing a new version with just one
quick change?  Marcello made a mistake, this seems to be the quickest
way to solve it in an unambiguous manner.  

Who cares how fast the kernel version number moves up, or for what
reason?

I can see your point of view as well, but I still think your arguement
that "they should know what they are doing" is bogus.

But hey, whatever Marcello thinks is fine by me.
