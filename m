Rik, in case you've missed that, I can and do speak for myself.  I had
spent ten years dodging the draft; when I decide to get enlisted into
something it will happen on _my_ decision and _my_ conditions.  When I
decide that I'm being forced into something I do not accept - you'll know
it from posting with URL of forked tree.

FWIW, I'm less than thrilled by the Andrea's patch, but it is salvagable.
I'm also less than thrilled by the whole situation with VM - all sides of
it.  I seriously suspect that we need a limited multi-way fork in that
area, so that you guys would stop stepping on each others' toes.  I'm taking
no part in your merry 5-way clusterfuck - sort that mess out between
yourselves.

Again, when I decide that situation is unacceptable for me - I'll simply
fork the tree.  I do _not_ appreciate being enlisted into anyone's holy
wars, so unless you really want to go _way_ up in my personal shitlist
(several positions below .ru DoD) - don't play politics in my vicinity.
