Yeah, I know I've bumped into that name (and probably taken notes) somewhere. 
 Hmmm...  Might be from "Where wizards stay up late", or might have been an 
article linked from slashdot...  (I don't THINK it was mentioned in 
"Hackers"...  Rodents, where was the reference...  Crystal fire?  That's 
mostly hardware.  Accidental Empries?  Doesn't sound right...  Can't have 
been "Fire in the valley" because I haven't read that yet, it's still sitting 
on the bookshelf.  Not soul of a new machine, that's post-digital Equipment 
Corporation...)

I THINK that's in the set of notes that's on the box that's not hooked up 
right now...  (Shortage of monitors at home.)

This was the dude who decided to apply a binary and boolean approach to 
electronic computation, right?  I KNOW I've read some stuff about him... late 
last year?

Now I remember.  Slashdot linked to his obituary:
