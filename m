s/Most people/Most enterprise people/

And this is really entirely the wrong attitude to take.  "Linux does not
have volume management" and "High-end Linux applications need volume
management" do not logically imply "we need to merge EVMS."

You need to fix the issues Christoph and others raised and you need to
work within the system.  I won't cry if EVMS is not merged.
