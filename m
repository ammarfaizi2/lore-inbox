You know, people often only look at things in front of their noses.  So 
people notice ATA and video drivers because they have the hardware. 
Whereas, do you really know what is going on inside some appliance?  And on 
this list is definitely in front of the nose.

Guys, you know who you are.  Apologise.  Please?

You know that this kind of thing just makes the community and its goals 
weaker.  All its varied goals.  Freedom, zealatrous, pragmatic, 
intellectual, business in the presence of freedom, even just business that 
isn't a huge corporate.  Whatever.

No-one is served by alienating people, except perhaps the corporate 
hegemony, and that indirectly.

Andre was not trolling.  Really.

Andre, I hope you change your mind.
