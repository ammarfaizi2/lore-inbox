#Include <hallo.h>



I just bought one of $subject (PDC 20268)

Removed a Ultra 66 from my system and plugged the new one into the 66Mhz
PCI-Bus (Intependent from the 33Mhz PCI-Bus (Tyan Thunder HE-SL Mainboard
with Serverworks HE-SL-Chipset))

Kernel is 2.4.4 with Promise support compiled in. (The Ultra 66 works like
a charm with this kernel)


But the new controller wasn't deteced by the IDE-Subsystem AT ALL. (It
only showed the onboard OSB4-Adapter)

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
