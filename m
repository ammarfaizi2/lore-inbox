Actually the GPL was drafted by lawyers. Any license when you dig at the
edges of how to exploit it gets just as nebulous, as horribly enough does
copyright law.

The merging one is analogous to other fun things like in the US if a java
applet violates a patent when executed is it the web site or the browser
user who broke the rules...
