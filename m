Hi All,
The archives & FAQs on this subject stop at December 2003. Google not 
much help either (prob. due to my keyword choices)

I gather the only way to do this is via the ruby patch.

(When) Will there ever be native kernel (and maybe XFree) support for 
multiple independent keyboards?

The ruby patch seems to also only have discussions older than 18 months.

Has there really been no progress in the last 18 months?

I would prefer to see "official and permanent" support for this as then 
when HW & drivers & kernels develop in the future, this capability will 
always be (immediately) available - and not have to wait for patches.

Can someone please refer me to recent archives on this subject, or 
update me on this issue if possible.

TIA,
Zoltan
