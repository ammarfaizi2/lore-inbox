One thing I will add, from long experience: If you learned BASIC
first, then learn Pascal BEFORE you try to learn C or C++ as you'll
come out a much better programmer than trying to learn C or C++
directly after BASIC.

Also, and probably even more important, set up your own Linux based
system and actively write software for it, not just in C but in things
like bash shell script. Especially software that appears to be totally
unsuited to the language - I wrote a floppy diskette formatter
entirely in bash shell script as an exercise, and I still use the
program that resulted, simply because it gives me much more data space
on the floppies without sacrificing MS-DOS compatibility.

I understand there's somebody on here who did BA Spanish as their
degree...

Best wishes from Riley.
