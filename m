I believe you refer to UCITA which is a STATE bill, not a federal bill.
All 50 states are passing/sitting-on versions of this bill. I believe
Virginia is the only state that has passed the bill AND is enforcing
it. Others have "delayed" it's effective date.

However, MANY states are passing/debating subsequent bills that NULLIFY
other states' UCITA bills, because the flaws in the UCITA bills are
becoming more apparent.
