I'd consider "If it does not work with the new version of libfoo,
please recompile" or "you need a newer blafoo tool to use this" or
"your compiler isn't usable for application xxx" much worse. 

And _this_ is common for many open source projects.

Reality Check: 99,9% of all computer users don't know what a compiler
is but can open Word 6.x documents in WordXP.
