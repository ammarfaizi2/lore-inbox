Sometimes.  If you sit down with product A and use it in the process
of creating product B which does what product A does, the courts have
held that you can't copy look-and-feel for example.  Independent 
derivation of the same thing is fine but just blatent copying is not.

It's true that you can copy the "math" as it were.  But look and feel
isn't math.  

The fact that you can be sued over look and feel is one of the reasons
that people do "clean room" reimplementations; if you can prove you
never saw WhizzWidget2000 and you reimplemented it then you are safe 
from any such suit.  Proving clean room is not easy, especially if the
product is widely available.  Look at the suits between intel and
some of the chip clones and you'll see what I mean.
