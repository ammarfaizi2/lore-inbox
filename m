Yes, but the m32r port has not been merged into the mainline kernel
tree yet...  May I send many small patches to LKML?

Thank you for your quick reply.

These files are required for mappi_ne.c.
The mappi_ne.c is based on ne.c and modified for an eva board "mappi",
I think it is highly dependent on the target platform.

There are two reasons that we placed some m32r specific drivers in 
arch/m32r/drivers/:
- We think they are highly depends on the target platform, and
- We can not merge them to drivers/ because the m32r architecture
  has not been supported by the mainline linux kernel.

Yes.

Do you mean I should use drivers/net/ne.c instead of mappi_ne.c?
I'm not sure how can I merge such target-dependent code fragments to ne.c.
But I will try to merge them.

These are obsolete codes, which were used in m32r 2.4 kernel.
In 2.6 kernel, a framebuffer device and video console driver 
should be reimplement for m32r targets...

They were used for debugging. 
I will rewrite to inline them, thank you.

I agree.

Hmm..  it is really strange.  I will remove it.
