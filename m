And it's the condescending, "Nobody else uses it, why should I?" attitude 
that will prevent it from gaining more popularity. There are people using 
it. There are people who want to see it mainstreamed. Face it, IPv4 is 
inadequate for today's needs. What happens when the entire IPv4 addressing 
space is exhausted? Move to NAT? I don't think so. NAT is a temporary solution
to a permanent problem, and IMO the wrong solution. There are still 
applications out there where bona fide end-to-end transparency is still a 
requirement. NAT destroys that, and therefore makes those applications 
either unusable, or difficult to use without special configurations.

No, IPv6 may not be mainstream yet, but there *are* people who want to use 
it. Just because you don't, doesn't mean that nobody else should. I, for 
one, will welcome IPv6's adoption with open arms.
