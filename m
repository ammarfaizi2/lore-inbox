Copyright: you named it.

Any other right: unchanged. (The GPL doesn't demand any change, so how  
could it possibly change?)

However, for rights you want to keep, I'd suggest pointing them out in  
some sort of readme in the sources. ("The XXX Logo is a registered  
trademark of XXX Websites, Inc.".)

Frankly, in the context of (say) a registered trademark, the GPL for the  
logo becomes fairly meaningless ... sure, you can get "the source", but  
you can't *use* it except in those cases where you'd get "the source" for  
a proprietary logo anyway, unless it's a really weird case.
