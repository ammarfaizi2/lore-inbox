Hello!

i bought a medion sim 2010 laptop, put the info i collected under
http://www.inforezo.org/~bboett/sim2010/

whichever linux distribution i try to boot stops after loading the
kernel....

none of them is able to start a working kernel....

i suppose its because of the graphiccard that shares its memory with the
proc....

is there any docu somewhere on how to boot such a thing?=20
i take any hint about how to get a linux workign on that box....

please add me as CC since the list robot doesn't like me, and the
list-moderator has other things to do as to subscribe me by hand....

--=20
ciao bboett
