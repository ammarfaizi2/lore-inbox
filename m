WARNING: This may be a front for money laundering to terrorism or
terrorist logistics support!

The U.S. government said that Osama Bin Ladin owned several South
African diamond mines.  This may be an attempt to traffic money that has
otherwise been cut off.

Consider yourself warned!

>From the Desk of: Mr Jonathan Khomo. B.Sc.(SAU) M.Sc.,MNIM 
Member, SADMNR 
_______________________________________________________ 
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY, PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA. 

Attn.President/CEO. 
Sir, 
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my
colleagues 
.Your information was given to me by a member of the South African
Export 
Promotion Council (SAEPC)Who was with the Government delegation on a 
trip to your country for a bilateral 
conference talk to encourage foreign investors. 

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
execution 
of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you
willkeep 
it confidential because of the nature of this business. 

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I work as a Director 
of Audit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two 
other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in 
US funds. 

The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value 
executed on behalf of my department by a foreign contracting firm which 
we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of
US$14.500,000.00(Fourteen 
Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars). 

Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original
contractor,leaving 
the excess balance unclaimed.Since the present elected Government 
is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,so as to
maintain 
good relationship with foreign governments and non-government
agencies,we 
included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the 
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). 

We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed 
funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.Details and 
change of beneficiary information upon application for claim 
to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your 
company. 

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you 
be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation 
will be US$3.625m (25%), while my colleagues and I receive
US$9.425m(65%)and 
the balance of US$1.450m (10%)for taxation and miscellaneous expenses 
incurred. 

The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with 
utmost confidentiality.It does not matter whether you/your company does 
contract projects as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of 
you/your company. Also, your area of specialization is not a hindrance 
to the successful execution of this transaction. 

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint 
us. 

Kindly notify me by email at (jkhomo1@post.com
</cgi-bin/compose?curmbox=F000000001&a=ee22b4be97580fd052652a1c093198f6&
mailto=1&to=jkhomo1@post.com&msg=MSG1033934613.56&start=43526&len=3229&s
rc=&type=x>) including 
your 
current telephone and fax numbers for further details upon your
acceptance 
of this proposal. 

Thanks for your Anticipated co-operation. 

Sincerely yours, 

Mr. Jonathan Khomo.
