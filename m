Then you end up with a copy of the token for every mountpoint, which may not
be what you want.

With my AFS client for instance, you want at most one token per cell per
PAG. Each cell contains potentially lots of volumes, and each volume is
mounted as a separate mount.

OTOH, with OpenAFS, you get one mount for everything and everyone, and that
contains all cells and all volumes, and so will almost certainly have the
tokens uploaded post-mount.
