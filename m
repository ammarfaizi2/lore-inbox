Take it for what you want. It's yours to disparage. Consider, though,
that I'm factually explaining the real-life result of resistance to
static instrumentation. It's not entirely detached, I'll admit, but
consider that it remained on-topic and entirely respectful of all parties
involved. I've enjoyed very positive relationships with all those
individuals and continue to hold them with high regard. They took the
decisions they thought were best at the time, and I can only respect
them for having acted as responsibly as they found relevant for their
respective organizations. I don't agree with it, but that's life. It
was just important to me to point out to the casual reader the source
of a lot of the fud than can be found on ltt -- i.e. lots of it is
marketing. For sure ltt initially got a lot of things wrong, but the
progress of kernel tracing overall would have been much better had
the naysayers actually chose to understand the problem instead of
stonewalling the efforts being invested.
