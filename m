That is standard procedure.

The thing is, this list has a lot of traffic (as you might have noticed 
:), and sometimes people don't have time to go through all the emails, 
and just take special attention at mails directed at them personally.

I use thunderbird like you and I have a filter to mark as "Personal" 
emails that have my address in the "To or CC" fields. This way, if I 
stop reading emails for a few days, when I get back, the first thing I 
do is just filter "Personal" emails to see if there are any messages 
directed at me personally. Then I can just browse the rest of the 
messages without paying too much attention.

Another side effect is that this method speeds up conversations, where 
the people already involved in a thread receive emails directly without 
having to wait for the list server to dispatch its queue.

Anyway, see:

for more information. (and the whole document while you're at it :)
