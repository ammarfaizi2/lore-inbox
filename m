Sorry. I think you missunderstood me. I am working on Postfix (see the 
headers of the mail), but we work alot with Qmail here.
I really never liked it that much (lots of things that just ich me alot), and 
I find myself happy with Postfix.
What I wanted was an opinion, just because lots of people are talking about 
data loses on some of the Journaling systems (especially reiser on IDE HD).

I hope nobody got offended, at least from my part. I totally disagree with 
the thoughts of DJB.

Once againg, sorry.
