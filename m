What conspiracy theory?

Oh you mean that one _technology_ is in the kernel
and another distinct, radically _different_ is NOT?

Oh you mean that conspiracy theory?

Yes, and they would all be MPT-like technology.
I don't have a problem with that.

What I have a problem with is that you folks
just sit and watch this, while you could explain
to James et al, that indeed the technologies
are different and there is no reason NOT to include
one but leave the other out.

:-)  That a nice way to get out of the situation.

I was hoping you'd say something like, "Yeah, the
technologies are different -- I don't see why one
should be in and another not."
