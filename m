I don't see how Dennis Grant's original message can be 
considered trollish.  It was very politely written, 
constructive, and on-topic.  Perhaps it is true that
some of the features he wants should be left up to
distributors, but his request for driver log messages
to be more detailed is reasonable.

My advice to Richard is to try not to feel offended.
Of the thousands of people reading a list like this, there
are always going to be one or two who reply after remembering
that they were supposed to buy more coffee yesterday ...
