You might stop and ask yourself how the people who work on this free
software project pay the bills.  I remember a recent converation with
Daniel where I said "if you work there, your work won't be GPLed" and
he replied "No problem".  It's interesting how quickly he lost his GPL
rules when he wanted a job.  Are you any different?  Is anyone any
different?  Obviously, everyone needs to eat.  So how many people are
doing development on something which is not GPLed in order to pay the
bills so they can eat and still contribute to something which is GPLed?
Most of the people here, right?
