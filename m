Hi.

I want to see what are my remote users doing on they accounts. For tty i
can use screendump from console-tools, butt how can i do it for pts? It is
possible?

I have heard, that making /dev/pts constens human readable is hard, and
that terminal constens is only one of many things that are in that device.

I asked on all Polish groups about ~linux, no one knows. So i search help
here.
