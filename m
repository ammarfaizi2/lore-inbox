Ohh, our prime minister declared USA the main defensor of liberty.
Of course he was thinking also to this law. You know he has three
television, a couple of newspapers and so on...
His natural attitude brings him to agree in every case with USA
government. He is a good vendor. Apart of this. In Italy we are making a
lot of pressure against a stupid law about copyrights, but
when the prime minister is the owner of the biggest television and most
important newspapers, and when the statal television and newspaper are
a little assentive with the government (oh... just a little),
we are under censure. And anyway we publish articles and public mails
about that, we open web sites. We try to inform, and belive me, italians
are not so interested is a soccer team is not involved.

USA citizens should have less dificoulties to do something similar,
but I am not informed of a real effort from them.

Luigi

p.s.
of course, please, tell me I am wrong
