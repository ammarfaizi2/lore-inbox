I usually never respond to political rants on LK, but has it ever occurred
to you that maybe software creation in all its forms is just
overvalued financially?

That Open source is reseting the equilibrium, of the computer industry
to a more sane level? why should any software cost more then say a book?

If Sun goes out of business it might just be a sign that as a industry
is maturing?

Sorry about being off-topic, and whistling in the dark at the same time.
