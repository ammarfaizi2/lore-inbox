If you want the problem solved, try supplying us with some useful
information rather than just p*ssing and moaning about it. What kernel
are you running? What's your architecture? Motherboard chipset? What
specific NIC(s) are you using? How do we reproduce the problem? What,
for $DEITY's sake, is the exact error message you're getting? 

Show a little effort.
