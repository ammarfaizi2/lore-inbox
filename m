I would like to celebrate Linux 10 by running some early kernel versions
from that era (I think v0.01 is a little too primitive).  Does anyone
have root/boot disks that contain v0.11 or v0.12?  Seems like oldskool
archivers at funet, sunsite, tsx-11 have purged their bootroot bin.

Don't ask me about if I tried compiling it.  Compiler support tools seem
to be even harder to find than the root/boot disks.

TIA
