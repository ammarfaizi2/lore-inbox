True, I also found that a large reason for the difficulty of googling
for Linux driver support info is that many projects that start as out of
tree drivers or reverse engineering efforts don't update their web sites
when the project ends with the driver being merged into the kernel (like
prism54.org).  So the web site still shows an incomplete list of
supported hardware leading users to think their newer hardware is
unsupported while in fact it probably works OOTB.

Of course it's easiest to just try it but I don't have the hardware on
hand...
