First:
I have received a rather harsh complaint email that told 
me that it was considered to be RUDE to post to Subject:
"Funding GPL projects..(etc)" in context of LKML. 

I agree in that Subject Sentence is rather [OT], but it 
seems like SUBJECT is of interest to air for  many LK 
developers (and others). Therefore I propose the above change 
in subject line to narrow the subject down to specifically
mean kernel related development projects. I hope that no one 
is offended by this remark of mine. Most postings so far in 
subject does in practise touch funding of kernel related 
development in one way or the other.

I believe that a lot of kernel development funding is 
already ruled somewhat (unofficially of course ) by similar
structures as above. Only: The User in point 1. is a larger 
company such as f ex IBM. By making the scheeme above available 
to anybody would probably be a nice improvement. Some question 
that remains to be solved is however: 

A. 	Who will want to make the nescessary work that is 
	involved to achieve this? I do believe that most of
	the Linux kernel development team are a bit too buzy
	making linux patches, while working on ordinary jobs 
	on the side.
	
B.	How should the work be organized in order to achieve
	project credibility and fair progress ?
	There are numerous court examples of funding abuse.

C.	The scheeme above might actually turn out to "need" funding
	for it 	self. There is even a big "riscue" that it will it 
	self eat up all the funding that it receives. ( Old bad own 
	experiences. )
		
Kind regards

P.S. 

If any body actually find my posting in subject above 
to be rude I would of course be happy to know this by mail. 
Being rude is certainly NOT my intention. Of course any 
kind of feedback besides this is always welcome
