The hang, or at least an X "pause" tends to happen in 5-10 minutes of
playing cuyo. (ï¿½2D game).  I have now had the last good kernel
(6ade43fbbcc3c12f0ddba112351d14d6c82ae476) running for almost 24
hours, only interrupted by the brief test of drm-less rc6.

Normal use haven't provoked anything. Since DRM sort of works with this
kernell, I tried tuxracer on the radeon.  (Trouble is always with
the radeon, never the mga xserver).  I played several games, ok
except for the usual lousy 5-9 fps. One time I had a "pause", the 3D-game
just froze for about half a minute.  The other xserver kept
displaying firefox (and updating the page too) but I could not
start any processes there.  I tried starting an xterm - it did not
appear until tuxracer "unfroze" and continued as if nothing happened. 
Perhaps the frozen process held a lock? 

Disk io seemed sluggish after that incident, and the load meter in
icewm seemed to indicate more waiting than usual.  The logs tells
me of SCSI aborts and a bus reset.  I booted into drm-less rc6 after
that.  

Some interrupts are shared on this machine:

The troublesome radoen has a irq of its own.  The scsi controller
shares irq with the matrox g550, but that card never seem to
cause any trouble, other than saturating the cpu during games. :-)

On to look at iomem and that rc6 crash.
