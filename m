   It's not a big problem today because if you ask me then i'll tell you that
   it's GPL-ed - but what will be the situation be in years? Couldnt
   'BitMover or any other operator of an Open Logging server' argue that the
   MetaData is owned by whoever created them, and is not covered by the GPL -
   and only 'BitMover or any other operator of an Open Logging server' has
   'permission to republish the Metadata'.
   
Anything you write is automatically copyrighted by you, even if you
don't specifically state it as such.

That is my basic understanding of copyright law.

BitMover et al. can't take your copyright powers away from you.
