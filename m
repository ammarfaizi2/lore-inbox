Because nobody will give the open source guys a look at the top sekkrit elite
documentation the mere viewing of which would immediately put the vendor out
of business...

If you are going to buy a Linux laptop always check the linux-laptops web site
first and never forget which company(or companies) screwed you last time. Its
possibly worth talking to Dell but the last bad "Dell" laptop BIOS problems
Linux showed up got nowhere because Dell just rebadged that product. You
might in fact have to moan at Compal or similar depending on which Dell you
have.
