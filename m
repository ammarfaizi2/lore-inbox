James,

2.5 still doesn't work on my vaio (I think I told you about this 3-4
months ago) with the neofb. It just crashes with a black screen. If you
don't have any clues what the problem is, I can hook the machine up to a
serial console and see if anything interesting pops up. Using vesafb
does make it boot, however the screen stays pitch black until X loads...
