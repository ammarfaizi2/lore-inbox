Partially true in most social systems.  However, the top of the pyramid 
has some substantial motivation to see a better kernel come into 
existence.  I personally feel motivated to ensure that ReiserFS patches 
don't get lost, because those 5-10% improvements really do add up over 
time.  We may also hope that they feel some pride of craftsmanship in 
constructing their social system --- I suspect that pride in what they 
do is more likely to move them.
