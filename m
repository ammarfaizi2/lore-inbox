Oh.. so now you're complaining that I pointed out that even a system that's
down 40% of the time meets *YOUR* criteria if enough more people run it?

In fact, if the number of Windows users is 100 times the number of Linux users,
and Linux is 98% reliable, then Windows only needs to make about 2% reliable
to win by your criteria.  OK, you want to complain about the 100?  Make it
500M windows and 50M linux, and Linux 98% reliable, then Windows only
needs to make 10% uptime to win by your criteria.

My point is that your criteria of "total aggregate uptime" doesn't prove anything
between diddly and squat about the actual reliability of the system.
