Because MSFT is bigger than SUNW :-) As that great American philosopher,
Damon Runyon, once said, "The race is not always to the swift, nor the

If I had 40 billion dollars for every software monopoly that sells an
unwieldy and hazardously complex development environment and is run by
an arrogant college dropout with delusions of grandeur who treats his
employees like serfs while he is acclaimed as a man of compelling
vision, I'd be a wealthy man.
