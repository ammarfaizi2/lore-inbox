Correct. But that introduces other disadvantages again.
It may be inconvenient to separate incoming mail into
a number of separate mailboxes that one has to visit
one by one. (Entirely apart from the question whether the
local setup makes it possible or convenient to do any filtering.)
Maybe you had other constructions in mind,
but I cannot think of any that would not waste some time.
