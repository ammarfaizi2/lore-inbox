They can, because they provide the source to do so.
Now does it have to be modular loaded, I suspect.
The have every right to prevent people from using their stuff.
There is no ruling standard body to force compliance.
GPL is enforced by the author, owner, copyright holder.
It may have started out under on dominion, but after MOSIX and the
unilatteral (sp) force binary module inclusion, that set the stage to tear
down the theory of GPL enforcement.

But now we venture to embedded space of changes, and there they do not
provide source code even if you are a customer.
So GPL is becoming a LARK.

But then again it has no real business model and I expect to be deleted
form the thread so I will do so before others.
