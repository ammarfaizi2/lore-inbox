Maybe they could provide such a program, if asked?
Basically, a chip detect and a switch statement containing all
the bios reset sequences they have.

They may want to protect "trade secrets" about innovative
3D-pipelines and such.  But the bios reset is probably not that
high-end, so perhaps they could provide source code for it?
