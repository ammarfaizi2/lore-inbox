It does smell like it, if Windoze is affected as well...

Still, I can think of a couple of things you could try:

      * disable the __HAVE_SHARED_IRQ definition in
        linux/drivers/char/drm/radeon.h; seems to work around some IRQ
        related problems, see
        http://bugs.xfree86.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314
      * try DRI CVS snapshot packages described in
        http://dri.sourceforge.net/snapshots/README.Debian
