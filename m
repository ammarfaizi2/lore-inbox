Thanks a lot to all 'extreme'-kernel-developers and especially to Linus (as ever) and Andrew!

I just compiled 2.5.75 on my old Alpha (AS1000A/333, Noritake). It compiled without problems! And it started up without problems (some warnings, but nothing the can't be fixed with 'vi /etc/*'). :-)

So thanks a lot, you did a GREAT job! I hope to see 2.6 (or even better 3.0) soon on that machine.

I can only recommend 2.5 on Alpha. It was (believe it or not) a performance boost on this machine!

Best regards,
 Oliver
