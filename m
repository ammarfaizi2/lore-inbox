You don't have to be out-of-spec, but doing things within the spec becomes
VERY expensive.  Those cheap-ass 30$ IDE drive trays are 110% shit.  Only
when you get into the >100$ models do they work reliablly without setting
the office on fire.  Even the 4500RPM drives get too hot in the cheapy's.

And IDE drive with an SCA connector would be great.
