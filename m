Would you like to be cc'ed on my spam folder?  50 to 100 spams a day?
Try being a member of the internet since the darpanet days and having
1400 domains with your email address.

Not an easy task.  At least in my country and specifically the
internet people are free to interact with others in the way they
find best.

Some people have spam filters, some don't.
