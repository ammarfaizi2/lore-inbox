Way back when I was in college and studying interrupts, etc., I wrote a
program to interrupt some little routine and reenable interrupts to
interrupt a routine, etc.  I was enthralled and thought to myself, "I
bet I could write a space game ..."

Way back when Linus was studying interrupts and got 1 0 1 0 1 0 ..., he
thought, "I bet I could get a movement started to generate an entirely
new unix-like OS so popular it will eventually take over the world".

Dream big.
