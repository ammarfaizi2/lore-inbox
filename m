Not sure who Jim Grey was, he never worked on XFS, ah well.

Ted, you of all people should know not believe all you read on
slashdot ;-) 'Linuxcare helping out with the funding' ha!

Both Jim Mostek and I left under our own steam at different times, Jim
in 2000 and myself in 2003. SGI still has great technology to work on
and, but the you can only take so many years of bad financial results
and watching people get layed off.

I still work on Linux, and follow development as much as I can. I keep
trying  to get back to OLS, but circumstances keep conspiring against
me, maybe next year.
