I too have been rejected at that address.  Like Grant, why bother seems 
to be the appropriate response.  If they want to here soonest when 
there is a problem, then the moderator should clear what is obviously 
not a spam message to the list in a reasonable time frame.  Its never 
happened to me but once and I was bascily told to "go away little 
boy." 

I'm already subbed to about 40 lists, and while there are some I could 
drop to make room for others, my interests are best described as 
ecclectic.

If the netfilter folks want to be artificialy quiet, shrug.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
