I haven't tested 40, but 39 works pretty well at home, just two minor
more or less related problems:

where could I learn how to adapt Makefile for the post (more or less)
2.5.21 kernels?

And is xawtv or other TV programm supposed to work (I have a DVB-s and
didn't manage using TV prog with it...)?

As soon as I found a 40 anywhere, I'll give a try ;-)

Have a great day,

	Grégoire
