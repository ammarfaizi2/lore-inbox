F5 (Manufacturers of the BigIP load balancers) have released their 
modified kernel sources & any other bits that are obliged under the GPL 
for their Linux (2.4.21 it looks like) based version 9.x of bigIP. If 
customers wish to get hold of the sources, then there is a solution note 
on theoir website with instructions on how to get the code.

I haven't tried compiling it yet to see that it's complete, but if 
anyone would like it uploaded somewhere for playing with let me know.

  Hamish Marson.
