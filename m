I did look around in CML1 when I had some troubles way back. Turned out to
be my fault, or was fixed in the next patch, so I didn't contribute back.
Trouble is that another opaque tool makes hacking _harder_, and this in
turn turns hackers away, and the development suffers.

Just use majordomo ;-)

CML2 hacking _is_ kernel hacking, if you like to call it such or not.
