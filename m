In the long run, for sure. I'm not saying Linus needs to be replaced, 
but his _manners_ could do with some work. Those XFS guys have worked 
quite hard to make the merge fairly painless, and Linus wont even 
comment (that I've seen, see 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103118187002156&w=2).

BTW: I'm only a lurker, I don't even use XFS :-)
