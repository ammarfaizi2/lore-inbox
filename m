David,

I don't have time nor the inclination to deal with your petty single
mindedness thought games at the moment.

However, what I will say is that if you think you know better than
solicitors, why don't you become one.  At that point you can start
preaching about such things to others.  Until then, your opinions
are only opinions and I don't have to take any notice what so ever
of you.

Welcome to /dev/null - since I can't handle the stress you're causing
by this.  It's nice and large and will contain everything further you
have to say on the subject *until* OSDL have completed their own
investigation into this issue.

It's rather a shame that you can't be patient and work this out in
a civilised manner isn't it?

Thanks.
