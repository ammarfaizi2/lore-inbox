Hi!
I have written the radio-terratec driver some time ago.

I am searching for someone who has send me an email about him being able to 
get the RDS part of the terratec card to work.

Unfortunately I have lost the mail and his address.

If you are reading this, please contact me.

Allthough I am reading the ml archive please CC: to me.

Thanks,
Rolf
