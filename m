Oooh, ooh, me too!

And I'm not even using libata (I don't think?). 
I'm just using stock 2.4.23-pre4.

This is a P4P800 with one SATA drive and two PATA drives.

The system works fine as long as ide-scsi isn't loaded
(and noflushd doesn't spin down any drives).

Getting ide-scsi working is pretty soon on my todo list as it means being able
to play DVDs and use the cdrecorder.
