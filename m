Come on, it's not like suddenly all the people who contribute to linux
are going to become blind and fall down the slippery slope.  Slippery
slope arguments only work in academic debates, the real world is much too
complex and robust to be susceptible, especially in the long term.

There's bugs to fix and features to add.  The day they are not accepted
because of your patch format, then we can take appropriate action.
