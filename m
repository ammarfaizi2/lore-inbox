"constructive" is a for profit model that sustains the hi tech 
industry.    The current
models have created a conduit for socialist disintegration of the 
american hi tech
markets, loss of jobs, and have funnelled technology out of the 
country.  Legal
defense funds should be the biggest red flags of all.  If this system 
you devised really
works, why all the litigation?  Why all the need for legal defense funds 
and patent
infringement insurance?   I've watched the entire market slowly collapse 
over the years
as the result of the affect of the GPL on America's hi tech markets. 

It isn't working, and it isn't sustainable.  non-profit and "temples" of 
GPL "religion"
have evolved, with the leaders living in orgnaizations that subsist from 
handouts and
donations.   This movement has spawned a global attitude that has no 
respect
for IP rights, and it's extended itself to no respect for human rights, 
or any other rights
of the indivdual.    That's the legacy this has left and the ultimate 
conclusion.

My 2 cents.
