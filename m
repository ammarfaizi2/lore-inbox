Conclusion:

You really should learn how to read :)


This is a *technical* discussion list. So far you been able to post 7
mails about vague ramblings about what you think the VM should do and
what swapping is (not to mention unjustified personal attacks).

If you really think there is a problem with the VM post benchmarks
demonstrating the problem. 

If you don't think there is a problem, don't waste our time.

If you want to continue this discussion, please do so off-list.

Best regards,
