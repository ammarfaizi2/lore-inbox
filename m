All I can say this fscking sucks! OK, I'll have to go over the system with
a fine toothed comb and see what's been done to it. Fortunately I'm on a
very slow dialup, so it may not be too troublesome.

Fscking script kiddies. Oh well, will let you know what I find.

I'm just wondering how they managed to get in given that I never download
binaries and always compile from sources myself. Probably through a
compromised TCP/IP service, I bet.
