How is the blacklist stuff supposed to work then? It must be possible
to map an alias entry to a list of modules, and check if any of them is
blacklisted. Then just 'for i in $DRIVERS ; do modprobe $i ; done'.

modprobe or some other tool can certainly resolve it, but something has
to make a decision based on a blacklist if a certain module can be
loaded.
Look at /etc/hotplug/pci.agent how it currently done, it parses the
modules.pcimap, fills $DRIVERS and passes that variable to the generic
modprobe function from hotplug.functions. It reads
/etc/hotplug/blacklist to decide if any of the modules listed in DRIVERS
must be skipped.
