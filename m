Well, you won't find any. The days when the floppy driver still worked we 
didn't have wifi, I think. Someone just has to adopt floppy to the new vfs 
api, and we'll be happy. However, most of us are into different things, 
and some of us don't even have a floppy.

unlikely(eGiven someone cares)...
