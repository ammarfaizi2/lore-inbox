Hi,

NTFS 2.0.1 for kernel 2.5.7 is now available. This is a minor update, 
mainly to allow binaries to be executed by changing the default permissions 
on files to include the executable bit. This feature has often been 
requested by wine users so here it is. (-:

Sorry for the quick succession of releases but the web server hosting the 
2.0.0 patches is now off line so I had to move the location and I used the 
opportunity to release this minor update.

Best regards,

         Anton
