And where's the people who wrote the code?  Are people at IBM really
all anxious cowards these days that can't submit their own code but have
to abuse a highlevel manager for it.

I must also say that I'm a bit disappointed by you, Gerrit.  Either you
haven't actually read the code or I vastly overrated your taste.
