The box hosting www.codemonkey.org.uk died dramatically
recently, resulting in the post halloween 2.6 document being offline.
I've had a few requests for me to put this someplace else
whilst I get things fixed up, so for the time being, you
can find the last version I was able to find in backups at
http://www.linux.org.uk/~davej/docs/
