I can remember having this argument back in the days of the BBC Micro.  The
BBC is the only machine I have ever seen that used 'disc'...  In those days
I assumed it was correct.  Over time, I came to accept that we used 'disk' for
the same reasons we use 'program' rather than 'programme'.

I haven't heard anyone in the UK spell it 'disc' for years....

When I last tried devfs (around the 2.4.0test era - a short and painful experience, but
that's another story) I was confused by the use of 'disc'.  IMHO it should be changed,
because it's simply wrong, even in england (so please stop blaming us for it!).
