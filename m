There is a skeleton in every cupboard  Yesterday is ashes; tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly Six of one, half a dozen of the other .
A golden key opens all doors.  Like father, like son The longest rope has an end
Belly full behind drunk. No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness
