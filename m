Ok IRQ routing problem on what seems to be an external IRQ.

Do your working kernels also have ACPI enabled and what do they say here ?

Ok I have a guess here - what does 2.6.19-rc6-mm2 do ? I've been working
on fixing up the VIA IRQ routing bugs as it happens. full dmesg of the
work/fail cases and an lspci -vxxx would be useful so I can see how the
hardware thinks it is configured.
