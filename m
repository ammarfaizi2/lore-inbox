hi

I wished to bring to ur attention the following
problems I experienced while trying to install the new
kernel.

I downloaded the entire source for 2.6 and then
applied the patch 2.6.0-test1-ac1

kernel 2.4.20 and accepting all the defaults. The
problem faced was in the file riscom8.c and the output

I couldn't get over this error. This is my first post
to the list and I am sorry if I have made any
mistakes. I just wanted to help.

Thanks
Panda
