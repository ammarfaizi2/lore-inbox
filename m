Hi All,

The Minneapolis Cluster Summit came and went 10 days ago, with excellent 
attendance and high-quality interaction all round.  Over the last few 
days I've been collecting slide presentations and related material onto 
this page:

   http://sources.redhat.com/cluster/events/summit2004/presentations.html

Unfortunately, due to manpower limitations and short lead time, we 
weren't able to arrange for audio recordings, which would have been 
great since both presentations and discussion were packed full of 
useful material.  I guess this means we have to do it again next year, 
this time with a tape recorder!  As for the results... discussion 
continues on linux-cluster and other mailing lists, please judge for 
yourself.
