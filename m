Does anyone have the publication numbers for Qlogic's firmware interface
specifications?  

I have been trying to get Qlogic to get me the document covering the
QLA1040's Target mode firmware and they seem to be having trouble
finding it.

Just thought I would ask.  Please don't send me the document as it is
governed by their NDA process...lame.

Sean
