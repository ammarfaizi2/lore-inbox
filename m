Thanks for the vote of confidence. :-)

Dell PowerEdge 6400 and 6450 servers can have up to 4 Intel Pentium III Xeon
700 or 900MHz CPUs.  The 900MHz/2MB cache ones aren't available drop-down on
the web page at the moment, but are if you call and ask.
www.dell.com/linux, choose PowerEdge 6400, "Buy This System", then call the
phone number 1-800-917-DELL listed there, and tell them what you want.
	Base code 649002
	Processors 4P9002M

Thanks,
Matt
