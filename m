I know this is off-topic, but a court in my home town Munich has decided 
that a cease and desist letter Harald Welte sent to a router producer 
(Sitecom) who used netfilter/iptables in his router but didn't publish 
the sources of the firmware with a penalty of up to 100 000 Euro is  
valid (a German version of the decision of the three judges is at [1]).

It's quite nice to hear that a court has decided that the GPL is 
enforceable under German law.
