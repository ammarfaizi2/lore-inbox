	Three letters: TMI.  Look, if you really wanted you could post
the description of your favorite positions and comparative study of
their effects on your productivity.  Once.  It would certainly raise
a lot of eyebrows, but that would be it.  But if you kept explaining your
preferences again and again and again, people would get annoyed.  And
if you would get into a habit of making recommendations to other folks,
people would get *really* annoyed.  Fast.  And that's pretty much what's
happening.
