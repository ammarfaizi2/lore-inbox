As I understand it, SCO is/was claiming that JFS and XFS are derived
works of the UNIX source base, because they were developed to match
the internal interfaces of UNIX, and with knowledge of the internals
of UNIX -- and they hold the copyrights of and are the licensor of UNIX.

I may be misunderstanding their points.  And I am not a lawyer.
