Their Web Page doesn't show anything new as a result of the Intel
deal. I understand that the Intel deal involved Intel-provided
hardware design in one of Intel's new campuses in India. Intel
has been in China for several years and established a $US200M
"China-venture" fund to bring 20-21st century technology to
China (broadband, semiconductor design, etc.)

Yes. Enough "final assembly", i.e., putting it in its shipping-box
is done in the US so they don't need a "made in China" label!

Similar to GE appliances.

I think the US design is going away. I think in a few years, Silicon
Valley will revert to some plum trees with migrant workers picking
the crop. I might be able to buy an orchard at Apple's former site
for a few thousand dollars. I've got to start saving now, though.
