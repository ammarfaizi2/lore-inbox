You are a lawyer working in this area, and so can cite chapter and verse
where this definition was made (the GPL text is rather vague)?

Anyway, Andreas Dilger is (curiously) right AFAIU: Linus has _never_
distributed a binary to anybody AFAIK, so he is under no obligation by the
GPL do give out any form of source. Furthermore, as he is (in the editor
sense at least) copyright holder for the whole source, he isn't bound by
the GPL in any case. ;-)

IANAL, etc.
