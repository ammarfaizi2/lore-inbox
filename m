hi

still - sorry if this is OT - I'm just too close to tear my hair or head off 
or something

The documentation everywhere, including the lilo 22.3.1 sample conf ffile 
tells me "use boot = /dev/md0", but lilo, when run, just tells me 

Fatal: Filesystem would be destroyed by LILO boot sector: /dev/md0

Please help

roy
