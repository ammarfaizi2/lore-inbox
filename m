I got one too many hatemails from a "nvidia fanboy" who blamed me for
just about anything wrong in the world.... I fear that most of these
people have no idea why open source drivers matter, or at least what the
consequences are for not caring about drivers being open or not.

this part of the "story" is fiction. A lot of the rest is not. There are
already several servers that you can only use with binary modules..
modules only available in full binary form for RHEL and SLES kernels for
example.
