I seem to remember a "don't post this email on the list here's what's
up" message
from you I that I honored your instructions and did not post, nor will
I, but I recall 
some reasonable suggestions from it. :-)

I've been working on LAN scalability for almost 20 years, and NetWare
LAN performance vs. Linux (or TUX) speaks for itself.  I would agree
that someone 
coming from a Unix background would have radically different views than
someone 
coming from the group who created the Networking industry that made
"LAN" a household 
word to the world at large.

It's the differences of all those who work on Linux that make it such a
potent 
mix of skills and views.  I think this is a very good thing, and I take
your comment 
as a compliment.

:-)
