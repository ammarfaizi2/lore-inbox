Ah, Mr Cox. You are a truly warm and wonderful human being. I can
confirm the setbrightness utility at the above URL not only works for a
picturebook. It works for a Z505GAT as well. That should mean it is OK
for a Z505LE in the US, too. The LE and GAT are significantly different
from older Vaios. The older ones all seem to use Neomagic video
controllers. These new models, and the new Crusoe picturebook, use ATI
Rage mobility. There might, therefore, be a number of subtle differences
from the behaviour of older models.


Now I just need ACPI hibernate to swap space, and a Gnome utility to
control this brightness thingy in my control panel! Oh, and of course
that Conexant modem port might be useful sometimes, if it worked!

Regards,
Steve
