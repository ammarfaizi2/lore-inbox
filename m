Subject: [PATCH] devfs v99.18 available
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

  Hi, all. Version 99.18 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.

Patch directly available from:
(NOTE NEW LOCATION!):
ftp://ftp.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.2/devfs-patch-current.gz

AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.2/devfs-patch-current.gz

NOTE: the devfs-patch-v99.x patches are maintenance patches for the
2.2.x production kernels. Devfs development is done against recent
development kernels. Occasionally, the latest devfs patch for the
development kernels may be backported to 2.2.x series, but this
happens rarely.

This is against 2.2.17-pre20. Highlights of this release:

- Ported devfs-patch-v99.17 to kernel 2.2.17-pre20

- Updated README from master HTML file

				Regards,

					Richard....
