I don't think this is the same case. The film _author_'s primary goal is
to have a lot of families buy his DVD to watch it. Whatever the MPAA says,
I can consider it "fair use" if a family of 4..8 persons watch the DVD at
the same time. However, I may consider it an abuse when a sports club
projects the film for 30 persons.

I feel sorry for you, really. Sadly, stupid american laws generally
contaminate Europe 10 years later, so we will eventually feel sad too.
