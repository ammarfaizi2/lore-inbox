I believe that the main problem in this dispute is just a 
missunderstanding based on cultural differences between Europe and 
America and the way articles are written and perceived.

True, to europeans this sounds far too overenthusiastic - almost like a 
commercial - and will most certainly lead to the impression, that the 
article is not very serious.

Europeans try to write serious articles VERY neutral - any personal 
opinion(s) will only be a short statement at the very end of the article.

It's just what we are used to!

Nobody likes them here, really. A product should stand out and prove 
quality by its own, we don't like to be told about it by people we don't 
personally know.(even if they may have a good reputation)

Another example to what europeans will regard as "unserious".
When we watch american commercials, which are sometimes broadcasted in 
Tv, we very often think about this as very odd. Simply very different to 
how this is done in Europe.

"Customer Quotes" have a very, VERY bad reputation, it smells like 
manipulation (whether it is or not).

Personal insults will not lead to anything, and IMHO should not be made 
at all. A response sticking to the facts might have been more useful.

Maybe a lapse made by Julien.
But the main topic still seems to be the style the article was written in.

Embarrassed?
Yes he most certainly will be, but what information did he provide to 
others? I dont't see much information about DTrace itself.

I hope nobody feels offended by my statements.
