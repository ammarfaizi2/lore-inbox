You can remove it.  But if you remove for with the obvious purpose
of abetting the distribution of non-GPL derived work, don't be
surprised to get smacked by courts who don't care for your technical
sophistry.

I've noticed it's become common to say this, but (NAL) I doubt it's
true.  I would expect a court to respect the author's intent within
some narrow range that would otherwise be ambiguous.  Intent and
community standards play a large role in law.  If enough people wear
a path across private property, it can become an easement.
