Where is your proof that nvidia includes copyrightable GPL
routines in their driver ?

Without such proof, you have no grounds to make an accusation
against nvidia.

Yes, I am at times annoyed by getting reports about "kernel bugs"
that turn out to be caused by the nvidia driver, but that doesn't
change the fact that that driver is made by nvidia and they get
to decide if and how they want to publish it.

Rik
