I beg to differ, Herr Doktor von Brand. It makes more sense to run a
not-up-to-date release kernel than it does to slavishly update to every new
release without any pressing need for new features or functionality. Don't
fall into the commercial software trap of "it's newer, so it *must* be
better!"--here be tygers...
