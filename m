I hope the Halloween feature freeze really will be a feature
freeze.  Nothing is more frustrating than having a "stable
kernel" broken every second release by yet another feature.

If we all restrain ourselves 2.6 will be stable soon and 2.7
will be started shortly after. Backporting "essential" features
from 2.7 into a _stable_ 2.6 will be so much easier than trying
to stabilise a 2.6-pre that's full to the brim of not-yet-stable
new features.

Rik
