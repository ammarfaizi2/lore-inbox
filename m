hmm.

I take it as blatently obvious that BK isnt a barrier to entry, as the old
methods still work fine.

what I /do/ appreciate is that by including directions to proprietary tools
in the docs, we are heading down a greased incline, so to speak.

Extreme example:

Include docs on 'how to avoid a pesky kernel compile' that teach how to
install windows, not linux because its an 'all in one' install with 'no
hassle'...

see how many people compile their own kernels afer that...
