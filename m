You paid for the Ford.  Suppose Ford offered to give you the car but
said if you take it then you can't go work at GM because this car is
ahead of their technology.

See the difference?  It's one thing if you plunked your money down and
took the standard license or a negotiated license.  You are getting 
an expensive product and not paying any money for it.  The payment is
the terms you agree to in the license and the obligations of those
terms.  That payment may be unacceptable to you, which is your choice.
