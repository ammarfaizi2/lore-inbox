Yup, that's me.  No, I don't always check my conscience at the door.  If
that were my habit I'd have spent the past three years comfortably
programming big, expensive machines under Windows.

N.B., not implying you're morally bankrupt, no suggestion of that at
all.  Still, since you just dumps on all those who prefer to follow
their hearts, you deserve to be publically challenged.

Let's pull back a little from the proselytizing, shall we?  I'll modify
my proposal to 'include just a pointer to the bk documentation in the
kernel tree itself'.  This should satisfy everybody.
