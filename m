Agreed, you're in a nasty position.  Basically your only hopes are
that (1) Level3 stops actively protecting spammers and kicks them
from their network  or (2) your sponsor moves to an ISP that isn't
spam friendly  or (3) another sponsor pops up out of the blue.

Until then I wouldn't worry about it and maybe send out the mail
via vger ?
