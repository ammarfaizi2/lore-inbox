Robert the key isn't ability it's experiance, the golfer asks his caddy
questions becouse the caddy has more experiance with the course, the
players loearn from the coach becouse the coach has more experiance then
the players.

Larry is saying that the key reason he is discounting some of the posts is
the lack of experiance of the people involved, they have nice sounding
theories, but they have not put the theories into practice so they can't
backup their theories with experiance.
