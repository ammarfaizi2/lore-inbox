Hi,

some body know if exist or is possible to do one
driver
to makes floppy drive use some type of "balanced" bits
distribution?
The idea is simple: format a disk doing inner tracks
with less bits than
in external tracks.
Maybe is better think in sectors and not bits
banlancing?

I want opinions about the idea, pleace.

Where can I find information about floppy drivers
programming, DMA setup,...?

Thanks,

Leandro
