Hi alan

I described the problem earlier on the lkml. (see Subject: Re: Problem with PCMCIA 8139too
Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2002 13:07:25 +0200)


What do you mean with "dump the pci status" ? lspci -vvxxx ?

There are some differences in lspci. I set it new with setpci. No success...:-(
Now I dump the cardbridge registers...it seems to be good...:-(

thanks

marc
