Dear Friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for 
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. 
My name is BATES ALAN a merchant in Dubai, in the 
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer 
as you can see in the picture in your attachment.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now 
I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. 
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I 
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my 
business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only 
focused on my business as that was the only thing I 
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know 
that there is more to life than just wanting to have 
or make all the money in the world. 
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come 
to this world I would live my life a different way 
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called 
me, I have willed and given most of my property 
and assets to my immediate and extended family 
members as well as a few close friends. 
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul 
so, I have decided to give alms to charity 
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last 
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed 
money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, 
Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself 
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one 
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have 
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and 
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to 
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as 
they seem not to be contended with what I have left 
for them. 
The last of my money which no one knows of is the 
huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars 
$18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company 
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit 
and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.

God be with you. 

BATES ALAN
