Hello people,

	I got some questions. When are we going to develop stuff for 2.5? What is
planed? My opinion for linux 2.5 should be performance. Since linux already
is stable or well done for nature, we could thing more on performance to be
a diferencial over others. What do you people thing?

PS: Not a good english. I know! :)
