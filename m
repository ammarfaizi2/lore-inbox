Dear Mr. Pavlik,

I have SuSE 7.3 installed on my home PC, together with a SoundBlaster PCI
128 soundcard (es1370) and a joystick attached to the gameport.  The
joystick is a Microsoft sidewinder, but I also have been equally
unsuccessful with a generic analog joystick.  I noticed your message
regarding the failure of the MODPROBE ns558 command.

I have two simple questions:
1. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET A JOYSTICK WORKING with the 2.4 Kernel?
2. If it is possible to do it, could you provide instructions or point me to
some sort of instruction/FAQ page?

Thanks!

											Regards
