Hi, we're working on an upgrade for bkbits.net and when we have it ready,
we'll want to switch the drives from one machine to another.  We're 
aiming to do this later today, so please update your trees now.  Linus
hasn't pushed anything since yesterday so this is probably a good time.

One side effect of the upgrade is that we're going to get an online hot
spare out of the deal, so in the future, we'll be able to do this sort
of thing behind your back and you'll never know.
