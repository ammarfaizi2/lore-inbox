And isn't that exactly the line of reasoning which leads you to the 
conclusion that Linux should be GNU/Linux?  Why do you think that
you deserve special billing ahead of anyone else?  You haven't 
contributed any more than anyone else, that's for sure.  GCC is 
nice and all, but by your own reasoning if GCC didn't exist, a
different compiler would have shown up.  The only reason they
didn't is that GCC made that itch go away.

It really seems like you are trying to leverage a comparitively tiny
amount of source into top billing.  Why are you more important than
the entire windowing system, which is dramatically more source and
more effort?

And when are you going to start referring to your kernel by its
proper name: Linux/Hurd?  Or do you have plans to remove the 
Linux components?
