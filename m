Hi,

  We are planning to implement a Network driver in
Linux.
Our requirement:
 A driver of layered one.., in which one layer
communicates with another. But overall there should be
only one driver . (Just like Stream's drivers, but we
don't want Stream Drivers). 
    Is there any support in Linux to implement Network
Drivers as multi layered in a single driver .If so,
please let me know where I can get good information?

With Thanks
regards,
vvgkrishna_78@yahoo.com
