Fund a project to implement a software modem. While a "real" modem might have 
better performance, softmodems are more of a raw interface which can be 
better in the long run-- for example, if some new super modulation is 
produced for 1mbit over regular phone lines, you could possibly just upgrade 
your modem software for the new feature. You can also use the modem for voice 
capabilities, and have your computer act as an answering machine while you're 
not using it for the internet.
(Note this is all theoretically possible, and might require actual coding to 
achieve; just pointing out that softmodem isn't necessarilly worse than 
hardmodems)
