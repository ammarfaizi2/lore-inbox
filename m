Dear Sir,

It's my priviledge to briefly introduce myself and the confidential business =
proposal in concern. I write you this letter of request for partnership which =
i hope you give your urgent attention as a
reputable and trustworthy businessman.

I am Mr Godswill Zabina from (Democratic Republic of Congo) a consultant, =
estate and properties valued visiting holland. I was consulted by Dr. Edoman =
Zabina (my Uncle) a personal assistance to the Director General of the Banque =
Du Congo, this is the highest bank in  Congo. The said Dr. Edoman Zabina is a =
uncle and has ask me to help him to look and arrange with a trustworthy =
foreign partner who can assist in keeping the sum of US$18.5M (EIGTHTEEN =
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in his Bank account for =
further investment.

The said amount US$18.5M was transported through Diplomatic Means in Two =
treasure boxes and is presently deposited with a security company here in =
holland since 18th of November 2002 although they do not know the contents =
and he declared the content of the trunk boxes to the security company as =
antiquities and personal effect. This was aimed at protecting the money from =
theft.

Basically, the money was deposited by Uncle Dr. Edoman Zabina before he was =
arrested by the government of my country and when there was probing to =
unravel the circumstances leading to the disapperance of some millions of =
dollars in the country's coffer, my uncle was subsequently arrested along =
with other high ranking officials of the bank.

We would have been able to claim this trunk boxes out on our own but our =
problem is  compounded with the fact that my uncle told the security company =
that the trunk boxes belong to a foreign affiliate who will come forward to =
claim it when due.

However your assistance is seriously needed because as Government official =
they are not allowed to operate any foreign account due to the D.R.C law, =
which does not permit government officials to operate foreign accounts. Dr. =
Edoman  Zabina has decided to compensate you with 25% of the total sum of =
US$18.5M then 5% will be set aside for expences incurred in the course of =
this transaction, while 70% will be for him and his partners.
If you are willing to render him your assistance regarding this transaction =
and safe keeping of the money, all necessary arrangements required for the =
speedy conclusion of this within TEN(10) working days has been concluded.

So i desire all information i have provided you to be kept secret to avoid =
more harm to him, Dr. Edoman Zabina (Personal Assistance to the Director =
General). I am in a position to provide you with further details immediately =
i received acknowledgement of this mail from you as soon as possible as you =
identify positive interest to assist.

For further informations and clarification on this issue please contact me =
through my directline +31-622-535-488 OR my email address.

Awaiting for your urgent responce.

Best regards,

Mr. Godswill Zabina.
