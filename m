	On a presario laptop (duron, 686b etc), I originally was unable to
hear sound after loading the via sound module from 2.4.17 kernel.  After
adjusting the mixer settings (using aumix) to the maximal possible
settings, the sound became only barely noticeable.
	Just for further clarification, there also exists "volume
adjustment keys" on the keyboard whose unusability may be something to
blame....I don't know.
	Anyone have any thoughts?
Steve
