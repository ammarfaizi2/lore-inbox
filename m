He's saying the 2.5 kernel won't come up
on his system -

Dean it'd be good to see your .config and
probably lspci and lsmod from the box when
it's running 2.4 - be sure and send those to
the list when asking such an open ended

BTW have you compiled a 2.4 kernel, or
have you been running vendor kernels
until trying 2.5?
