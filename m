It is unfortunate that this could not have been resolved in a more mature
manner.  Saying "I don't like the way somebody is doing something.  I won't
bother to talk to them about it, I'll just flame them and try to undermine
their work." is not acceptable.  It would have been nice if you'd actually
tried to work this out instead of handling it this way.
