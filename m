Not quite yet. "I've only begun to fight!" They won't
trust us with getting mail into our physical systems
anymore because they think that we can get viruses
and spread the plague like M$. They don't understand
that virii, worms, and clap are M$ instruments.

They have been port-scanning this machine all day long
with some kiddie-script that's supposed to break into
M$ machines. They do that from INSIDE the firewall in
an attempt to "prove" vulnerability. So far, it just
eats CPU cycles, dumping the net-spew on the floor:

  20: 2713636494   IO-APIC-level  eth0

.. that many network interrupts since this morning...

Cheers,
