Subject: Hang when booting 2.4.0
Message-ID: <20010126194101.B1171@jack.bonedaddy.net>

My apologies in advance if I missed this in the archives (I found three
or four threads discussing hangs at boot, but none related to 2.4.0 and
the suggestions for older kernels that still applied to code in 2.4.0
didn't change the symptoms).

My kernel hangs after the "Ok, booting the kernel." message.

This is on a machine with a DX440LX motherboard and only a single
300Mhz PII installed.

I can boot 2.2.16 and 2.2.18 kernels successfully.

I've tried paring down the config to a minimum (.config included below),
but still have the problem.  Specifically removing any SCSI since I
had heard of problems with the AIC-78xx.

Thanks for any ideas or insight,

Todd Goodman
