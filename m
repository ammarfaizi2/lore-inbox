Then you should know more about Europena culture than stated below:

a) Tell MSFT about it, not us.
b) How many stores did you visit (in Amsterdam and in Aachen) and how
   many of them are there?
c) I don't believe that the average store in .at, .de or .nl sells
   pirated copies - this is as illegal here as in the US.

You should then learn more about the difference (both factual now and
historical) between authors rights as in .at now (in .de years ago) vs
copyright in GB/US.

The question of jailing is "illegal vs illegal" - not a moral question.

"Socialist" or "communist"? These are in Europe two totally different
things (though they usually share the same political color).
And it is probably better than the alternatives.

Which leads to the immediate question why the concept and license was
born in the US?

Who uses it this way?

"freedom" as "anarchy light"?

The Bader-Meinhoff-Gang was a very extreme left wing terrorist group
which also killed e.g. German minister. Putting this as example for
Germany is like stating that Timothy McVeigh is an average US citizen.

Yes, the Green parties (at least in .at and AFAICT in .de) where a
"threat" to the old established parties since a new competitor came up
the horizon. And the tries several things (which you didn't mention) to
"fight" the new competition (without much success BTW).

Sorry, no details out of my head.
But apparently some radicals where there. If they were "invited" by the
demo organisers or even organised the demo themselves, is another
question which you should answer if you bring this as an example (or
should we hunt for similar events in the US and present them as
example?).
Or did they just came to make the action and get filmed by journalists
since a peaceful demonstration for cili rights and similar doesn't get
the headlines (and Pulitzer price?) - only the action.

Should we now start the "which country got the worst radicals in which
century" listing?

You measure FOSS only on old models (and do not question these models).
Successful companies adapt to new models and who cares about the
remaining - and thus - unsuccessful ones?
Can it be more "capitalistic" (the word has probably at least as much
negative as positive meaning - and leftists probably don't agree even to
that).

> and Windows is continuing to get stronger and stronger.  It's tough

Yes, MSFTs propaganda is apparently working in the US.
And it is a pity that no one is questioning the commercial methods and
strategy of such copmpanies (and no, the point is not about "Win*
software is better or worse than free software", we are here at a much
higher layer then technical facts since technical facts are completely
irrelevant regarding these commercial methods).
