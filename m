Banning Joerg (or anyone else for that matter) from LKML doesn't solve anything.
You may agree or disagree with him, but just shutting him up on LKML
doesn't solve any problems. Discussion of the issue, technical points
and counterpoints etc solve issues.
Cencorship is never a solution, that way lies stagnation and a
one-sided world view.

Do you have to have an app using a given feature of the kernel to be
allowed to participate in a discussion? That's news to me...

If you can't stand a given person then add him/her to your personal killfile.
The fact that a person likes or dislikes a specific group of people or
a specific Linux distibution or whatever may make them obnoxious or
disagreeable to you personally, but that doesn't mean that they
shouldn't be allowed to express their views.   You are always free to
ignore Joerg if you want.

And who's to be the judge of who's a troll and who's not?  you? me?
some third party?

I personally agree with some things Joerg is saying and disagree with
others but I still believe he should be allowed to speak, and a mail
such as yours is at least as annoying/offending/trollish as anything
he has said so far.

If he bothers you, just ignore him.

Now let's get back to a technical discussion.
