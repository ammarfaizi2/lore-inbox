 Maybe for developers, but users like it.  I can still remember back in
the Old Days, taking those error codes and looking them up in something
called a "manual" where there was a coherent explanation of
what had gone wrong and even suggestions on what to do about it.

 (Of course there were drawbacks, too... when the leather belt driving
the Difference Engine broke, for example, it was every man for himself!)
