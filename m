Hi folks,

Kernel Traffic has had a bit of an erratic schedule lately, and I finally
decided to take an official break from it, instead of doing the on-again
off-again thing I've done for the past 6 months or longer. The lkml traffic
has grown a lot over the years, and it's finally gotten to be too much for
me, at least too much to continue KT in its current form. If I do start it
again at some point, it will probably be quite different from what it has
been until now.

Be well,
Zack
