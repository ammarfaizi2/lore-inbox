See   http://www.tux.org/lkml/  for the list FAQs like what your
question is.  The answer should be in there.

What you have sent to the list was:

   Content-Type: application/x-gzip;
       name="nls_932_936_949_950.patch.tgz"
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

It was 140 kB in size, and that alone blocked it.
Linus wants plain-text diffs.
