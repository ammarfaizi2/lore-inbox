Subject: 2.6.16-rt10 crash on ppc
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Dear all,
Today I have tried Ingo Molnar's patch-2.6.16-rt10 on a ppc (PQ3 MPC8540ADS)
For testing purpose I have enabled packet routing  and send ethernet
packets over the system with a network test equipment. under light
load  on ethernet, the system is working fine, but under heavy load,
firstly console freezes, then the message below prints on the console
again and again. The system without patch is working fine on light or
heavy loads. What can be the problem, is there a bug  or am i doing
someting wrong?
Thanks alot..
here is the console output and my kernel configuration
