Thats just it, Im automatically called a troll because I disagree with the community. And in responce of what about 14 people said, yes, ive been using linux for a very long time, and Ive read the lkml for a very long time as well. Yet, somehow, people still want to say I dont know anything about the kernel. Well, those people, and you trolls know who you are, your mail is now automatically dumped into /dev/null. Now as the whole fact of me leaving, why should I? I have more than a right to stay here because I _dont_ agree with the major players. This is something that imho has gone on way too long. Linus and ac arnt gods. Or whatever the gnu church is calling deities now. I didnt speak up for a long while because I was afraid that this would act as some lighting rod for all the trolls, flamers, and the rest of the luser hordes. And, though I wish it didnt, it did. And, yes, there arnt that many people that disagree with the community and still want to help it. Its about 10 people. I dunno, maybe we need more of us. Especially if they show how petty most people can get. Im tired of alot of the stupid linux kiddies and gnu worshipers. But, I have to deal with them. Specifically, my /dev/null deals with them. Im tired of those people because they say the same thing over if they are right or wrong, "Linus/ac/$diety is right!" Linus and ac would agree with me, they havent been right 100% of the time, yet, if you listened to the (massive) group of cluebies, you would led to belive that these two geeks are superhuman in some way. This is far from the case.  Now, if everyone still thinks that Im the troll here, I seriously think everyone needs to take a deep breath, may be two if the first one didnt work.
