This would take a lot of watching on their part.

My cable company occasionally portscans me, so I blackholed the
portscanning machine.  Even before I had done that, though, they never
complained about my remote logins.  They only complain if you use
excessive bandwidth or if you do anything commercial.

The DSL provider here, when it was still US West, explicitly stated to me
(over the phone) that they absolutely did not care what I did with it as
long as it was not illegal.  However they would still not give you a
static IP address unless you paid them extra money. :}
