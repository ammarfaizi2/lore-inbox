Nice.  This looks like the first hardware router that could really
fancy my wishes.  And if I buy this piece of hardware, Dell can
attribute that directly to the software running on it and the kind of
control it offers to me.

Should be a great thing for companies as well.  Unknown software
without support or updates and a direct internet connection is a
nightmare for security.  And that was what most "hardware" routers
boiled down to and still do.
