Hi,

We have purchased a lead list purporting to be a list of people interested
in increasing their odds of
winning the official UK lottery and we would like to ask your permission
first before sending any further 
information.

This is the most exciting development project in the history of playing the
lottery game.
If you play the official UK Lotto then do what everyone else is doing now
in the UK and around the 
Globe. Join the e-lottery syndicate and increase your odds to 1 in 13.
Refer friends and family and earn 
up to £97,000 per month (cc.$150,000 USD) in referral fees alone.

Results by email, free service to all! Worldwide Applications Welcome!

To receive further information, Please reply to the link  below:

gazbo67@excite.com  and put More info please in the subject line.

Oh don't forget to send me your full name too.

Those who do not respond, will not be contacted again and will be removed
from the lead list.

Thanks

Gary

P.S. For those wishing to become more active with referral networking and
run a home based business,
this might be just the thing you are looking for. I personally have not
seen or been involved in anything
so explosive!!.
