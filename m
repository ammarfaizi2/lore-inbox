Hi,

We are a group of three undergrad CS students, almost ready to start our senior project. We have this idea of integrating a graphics subsystem with the kernel and doing away with the X server. We are not really sure if this is a wise thing to do. It hasn't been done before. Your comments on this idea will be very helpful.


Thanks,

Athar
