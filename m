This is Linux-RAID specific and not material for the linux-kernel
list.

Please, just post your questions to linux-raid, not linux-kernel.

And most importantly, when you ask me these exact same questions in direct

question as well.

Thank you,
 (and you got the answer in the reply to the direct mail two minutes ago)
