Hi again!
In Device Drivers/Graphics Support/Console display driver support/VGA test 
console (NEW)
The description is the following:
"
Saying Y here will allow you to use Linux in text mode through a
display that complies with the generic VGA standard. Virtually
everyone wants that.

The program SVGATextMode can be used to utilize SVGA video cards to
their full potential in text mode. Download it from
<ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/console/>.

Say Y.
"
This is not an option anymore and there is no choice to be made, therefore 
the user doesn't have to/can't say Y. This should be only a description.

Thanks for last time, I hadn't realized that there was a misunderstanding on 
what I meant
and "Are you sure?  It makes sense to me the way it currently is..." made me 
think that you didn't see the use of having all 'x86' written all the same, 
with a lowercase x. :-)

Well, good job guys, keep it up!
