Right.  I'd make a fuss if it were someone who was also working on 
Subversion, yeah, for the obvious reasons.  That's why that clause
is in there.  On the other hand, if Ben was ftping all the csets from 
your machine and shoving them into Subversion there isn't a darn thing
I can do about it, it's not my data.  So you're fine.
