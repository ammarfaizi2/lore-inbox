Because decoding a MP3 is a trivial operation.

I can't find the reference, but IIRC it was stated later that they don't
want to apply this to free (as in beer) software.

If you digitalize it, yes.

When we tried to define what is "software", the only acceptable
definitions we found were things like "every kind of numeric stuff" or
"everything that can be included in Debian". You can try to come up with
your own, you'll see it's not that easy.

Without the GFDL documentation, you'll have the right to lock the room
in which you put the CDs. The GFDL forbids that, because you'd be "using
technical measures to obstruct further copying" of the documentations.
