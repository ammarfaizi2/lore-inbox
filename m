I'm probably doing this too early, but it's been pointed out in so many 
words that I won't scale.  I've spent two full work days digesting all 
of the discussions on LKML, kerneltrap, and slashdot.  That's been as 
fun as you can imagine, but when the time comes for me to start working 
on the design, I can't do that at all anymore.

What I'll need are representatives of the community who work with me to 
make sure that my design does what everyone needs it to do, and I need 
representatives who engage in mailing lists and extract for me 
information that I should see.

I'm sure there are lots of people who would love to have that kind of 
influence over a company whose hardware they want to buy.  I need the 
subset of those people who have expertise in 3D graphics, most of whom 
I'm sure are on OpenGL and X.org mailing lists right now.  If there's 
anyone here who can get me connected with those people, I would 
appreciate it very much.


I feel like I'm being presumptuous.  Although everyone at Tech Source is 
excited by the idea, and there seems to be a ground-swell of interest, 
the economic feasibility of this is still in the air.  I don't want to 
waste anyone's time.  However, a lot of excellent ideas have been put 
forth, and I'd like discussion to continue, but in a way that I can handle.

I humbly request advice on how I might go about handling all of this in 
the best way.

I also think the discussion should transition off LKML and onto its own 
forum.

Also, I want to thank everyone for talking to me about this.  Members of 
this list and people posting to kerneltrap and slashdot have been very 
informative and helpful.  I also want to mention Jeremy Andrews of 
kerneltrap.org who first turned my posting into news.  I've wanted to do 
a project like this for a long time, but the past few days of online 
discussion have really helped push it towards becoming reality.
