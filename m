I included the URL's so you could check for yourself but I arrived at
those numbers by taking the world wide revenue associated with servers
and dividing by the number of units shipped.  I would expect that would
include the add on stuff.

I'm sure IBM makes money on their high end stuff but I'd suspect that 
it is more bragging rights than what keeps the lights on.

I think the point which was missed in this whole thread is that even if
IBM has fantastic margins today on big iron, it's unlikely to stay that
way.  The world is catching up.  I can by a dual 1.8Ghz AMD box for 
about $1500.  4 ways are more, maybe $10K or so.  So you have the cheapo
white boxes coming at you from the low end.  

On the high end, go look at what customers want.  They are mostly taking 
those big boxes and partitioning them.  Sooner or later some bright boy
is going to realize that they could put 4 4 way boxes in one rack and 
call it a 16 way box with 4 way partitioning "pre-installed".
