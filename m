Hello, 

Please, consider this mail as very important and do
let me know your honest response within the shortest
time possible…Obviously, you have no knowledge of who
I am, but I am Ms Rose Sadra, from Sierra Leone, but
resident in Sengal  (West Africa). 

I am interested in investing in any lucrative business
enterprise in your country and do want to use this
opportunity to seek your advice on the possibility of
investment in your area. Over the recent years, there
have been cases of political instability in most
countries here in Africa and as a result, I am afraid
to invest my money here. On this note, I have decided
to look else where for possible investment
opportunities, hoping that I would achieve this goal
with the assistance of a reliable person. 

I would like to know if it would be secured and
lucrative to invest in your country and after a
careful feasibility study of the various possible
fields or industries in your country by your kind
assistance, I would transfer my funds to your country
for investment. In a nutshell, I do have a large
amount of money to establish an ultra modern company
in your country, but I will like to know the possible
channels available in your area. Please, do assist me
carry out a careful survey and get back to me on the
various possibilities. If you do not have any much
knowledge about investment or business, I will
appreciate if you could recommend me to some business
experts individuals/companies/business consultants) in
your area, who might be of help to me. 
I do hope to know you better in the course of time and
if trust is established between us, I might need you
to be actively and directly involved in this proposed
venture. But for the time being, I would like to know
you better and hope we could get acquainted within the
shortest time possible. In my next correspondence with
you, I will give you a clue of how much I intend to
invest in your country, but for now, I look forward to
receiving your response and hope this opportunity
would bring us closer for a possible business
relationship between us in the near future. 

Have a nice day and best regards, 

Ms Rose sandra
