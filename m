Maybe.  I'll leave that decision to whomever decides to
invest his time and/or money in implementing such software.

That would be a bit premature.  I certainly wouldn't switch
to a piece of software that doesn't exist yet. ;)

To put it more bluntly: free software would have to implement
a very significant amount of Bitkeeper's functionality before
I would ever consider switching to it.

At the moment there simply is no equivalent free alternative
to Bitkeeper, so there's nothing to switch to.  Once such an
alternative exists we could continue this debate.

kind regards,

Rik
