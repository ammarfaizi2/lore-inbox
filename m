If you look at the 2.4.17-pre6 changelog you will see:

- Create __devexit_p() function and use that on 
  drivers which need it to make it possible to 
  use newer binutils				(Keith Owens) 

It comes from using the latest binutils, let me guess - you run debian 
sid? :)  If you wish to compile 2.4.16, you need to downgrade binutils 
...or try a pre-patch starting with 2.4.17-pre6
