Here's a suggestion: instead of arguing that you are right, prove it.
Put your time where your theories and go start companies based on 
those theories and show up with all sorts of new things that you've
built for pennies on the dollar compared to the commercial companies.
I've suggested this before and I get "well, I don't want to run a 
company, I have no experience doing that, but you should run your 
company based on my untested theories".

I'll start listening when you start doing.  Until then, you are just
flapping your gums.  Flap away if it makes you feel good.
