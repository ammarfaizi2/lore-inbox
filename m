Hello,

looking for new ChangeLog-2.4.28, I was happy to see that now you can
find prims54 support inside kernel! (event if I don't have *yet* a WiFi
card with Prism chipset... but I'm looking for...)

I decided to look for .config configuration for prism54, but even if I
can find "title" in Wireless sub-menu, I can't choose it ! (with both
"make menuconfig" and "make config")

I searched for some bug announce for that, but I didn't find one !
Maybe I missed in another menu a dependency to access this one ?

Thanks by advance,

Alexandre

PS : I will surely try soon Wireless card with Ralink RT2500 chipset
that we can find "sources" for linux on Ralink website. But this sources
are not actually under GPL. Do anyone ask Ralink company for this ? (if
it's not under GPL you can't include in kernel no ?)
