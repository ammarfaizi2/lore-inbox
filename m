Ok I don't have the system in question, but i use others' experience with
the problem. The system is 2xPentium II Celeron 600 Mhz, 256 MB RAM, Video
Card Matrox Millenium G400, HDD 15 Gb Maxtor 7200 rpm, 2 Mb Cashe,
MB Abit BP6.
Both with kernel version 2.2.17 and 2.4.0-test11 after switching from
X to the console the system hangs, nothing changes if the console is frame
buffer or vt. If for X is used XFree 3.3.3.6 then the problem doesn't
appear.
Any help is apreciated, I don't really know if the problem is with the
kernel or with the config, so any directions will be a lot helpfull.

Thanks in advance.
I'm not on the list, so if there is something i should read please send a
