Split the checkpoint list of the transaction into two lists. In the first list
we keep the buffers that need to be submitted for IO. In the second list are
kept buffers that were already submitted and we just have to wait for the IO
to complete. This should simplify a handling of checkpoint lists a bit and
can eventually be also a performance gain.
