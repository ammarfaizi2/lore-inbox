I hate to say it, but "notice" and "include" are two different things. He
noticed the "write oops to disk" feature, he just didn't like it. Linus is
a great developer, but he has limited sys admin experience, if any. 
Hopefully he will think it's cool, but don't assume that if you can get
his attention he will respond as you wish. 

Best of luck on this.
